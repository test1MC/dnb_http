   With the US accounting for about one-third of its parent's annual revenues, Novartis Corporation plays an important role in the global Novartis organization. Product-wise, the Pharmaceuticals division is its largest segment, bringing in more than half of Novartis' global sales. With dozens of products on the market, its areas of concentration span a range of medical ailments, including those in the cardiovascular, metabolic, cancer, organ transplantation, central nervous system, respiratory, and infectious disease areas.

  <p>
   Some of Novartis Corporation's key US brands include blood pressure medication Diovan and leukemia drug Gleevec. The company also sells multiple sclerosis drug Gilenya and pulmonary disease medication Arcapta.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) aims to discover new pharmaceuticals based on molecular science using techniques such as bioinformatics, genetics, imaging, and chemical technologies. Massachusetts-based NIBR has a research site in New Jersey, as well as overseas sites in Switzerland, Austria, Japan, and the UK.

  <p>
   In addition to its core pharmaceutical operations, Novartis Corporation is engaged in the manufacturing of crop protection products and seeds, clinical nutrition products, and health care food service products.

   To keep its pipeline pumping with new drug candidates, Novartis conducts research and development efforts at locations worldwide (through the NIBR and other institutions). Gaining marketing approval for new drugs is increasingly important for global pharmaceutical firms, as patents on former bestsellers expire and generic competition continues to grow. Indeed, Novartis partners with the

    University of Pennsylvania

   's Perelman School of Medicine for clinical trials that evaluate the efficacy and safety of CTL019 in patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to R&amp;D efforts, the Novartis organization keeps its product offerings fresh (and competitive) through acquisitions and partnerships.
