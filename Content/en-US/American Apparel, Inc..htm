   American Apparel wants you to be hip and comfortable inside and out. It makes and sells logo-free T-shirts, tanks, yoga pants, and more for men, women, and children -- and does it all from its California factory, rather than exporting labor overseas. Its 235-plus retail stores in 20 countries carry the company's Classic Girl, Standard American, Classic Baby, and Sustainable Edition brands, among others.  Known for its fair treatment of factory workers but also for alleged sexual harassment of staff by its CEO, American Apparel has seen its share of troubles. In late 2016 the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in just over a year. It had emerged earlier in 2016 from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which was filed in October 2015.

  <p>
   In late 2016, American Apparel again filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The filing marks the second time in just over a year the company has filed for bankruptcy protection. In October 2015 it filed for bankruptcy after reporting losses each year since 2010. It had emerged in early 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   In connection to its 2016 bankruptcy, American Apparel has been looking for a buyer for its brand-related intellectual property rights, manufacturing operations, and retail locations.
   <company id="57292">
    Gildan Activewear
   </company>
   acquired the company's brand and some manufacturing equipment in early 2017 but declined to purchase American Apparel's locations. Gildan indicated it may purchase the retailer's inventory in a separate transaction.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company has four reportable segments: US Wholesale, US Retail, Canada, and International.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US Retail segment comprises the nation's retail store operations, which include about 135 retail stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US Wholesale segment is involved in wholesaling undecorated apparel products to distributors and third-party screen printers in the US; it also consists of online consumer sales to US customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Canada segment includes retail, wholesale, and online consumer operations in Canada. It includes about 30 retail stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   American Apparel's International segment consists of retail, wholesale, and online consumer operations outside the US. The segment's retail operations comprise 75 retail stores in 18 mostly European countries. Outside Europe has stores in Israel, Brazil, Mexico, Japan, China, and South Korea.

  <p>
   Based in Los Angeles, American Apparel sells its products worldwide. It operates more than 235 retail stores in 20 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   American Apparel makes its products in California. Its downtown Los Angeles facility houses its executive offices and many apparel manufacturing functions, such as cutting, sewing, warehousing, and distribution. Knitting operations are conducted both in Los Angeles and Garden Grove, California. Its fabric dyeing and finishing facility is located in Hawthorne, California.

  <p>
   American Apparel's target market is young metropolitan adults age 20 to 32 who live and work in major urban markets and have a disposable income. The company's largest markets are New York, Los Angeles, London, and Paris.
  </p>
  <p>
   American Apparel has been known for its bold and controversial advertising. It produced internally-developed, edgy, high-impact, visual advertising campaigns for print, outdoor, in-store, and electronic communication vehicles. However, the company has been moving toward less flashy advertising as it attempts to remake its image.

  <p>
   While sales have risen modestly most of the last five years, net loss hasn't dipped below $37 million and in 2013 it plunged to a loss of $106 million. American Apparel reported a 4% drop in overall sales for 2014 due to lower sales in all divisions except US Wholesale. Lower sales and impairment charges related to closing stores lead to a net loss of $68.8 million, a 35% improvement from the prior year's $106.2 million but still in the red.

  <p>
   In connection to its second bankruptcy in late 2016, American Apparel sold certain brand-related intellectual property rights and some manufacturing assets to
   <company id="57292">
    Gildan Activewear
   </company>
   for $88 million. Gildan declined to acquire the company's retail locations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The bankruptcy came on the heels of controversy and upheaval at American Apparel. Following the sexual harassment allegations made in 2014 by employees against CEO and founder Dov Charney, the company ousted Charney and brought in a new CEO, CFO, and general counsel as well as other management. It also rejiggered its product mix and increased its online presence internationally to try and get back on track. American Apparel settled or dismissed the many sexual harassment suits filed against Charney but faced others from laid off workers and, eventually, Charney himself for defamation. In the fall of 2015 the troubles came to a head and the company announced that sales had continued to fall and it might not have enough cash on hand, or room to borrow, to make it through the next year.

  <p>
   The apparel maker has been beset by declining sales, a crackdown on undocumented workers at its 800,000-sq.-ft. factory in Los Angeles, liquidity problems, and an investigation by the US attorney's office in New York related to the company's abrupt change in accounting firms. As a result, the clothing maker laid off about 25% of its factory workforce (about 1,500 employees) in 2009 in Los Angeles following a probe launched midyear by
   <company id="150400">
    US Immigration and Customs Enforcement
   </company>
   (ICE) authorities. The company, which employs many Hispanic immigrants in its factories, faced thousands of dollars in penalties for hiring ineligible workers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 American Apparel also received a timely rescue investment from a group of Canadian investors led by Andrew DeFrancesco's private equity firm Delavaco Capital and Michael Serruya, the creator of the Yogen Fruz chain and ice cream giant Cool Brands. The American Apparel deal gave it up to $40 million, which included about $14 million immediately, in exchange for shares at 90 cents apiece. The T-shirt maker plans to use the funds injection to breathe new life into its manufacturing and distribution operations.
