   Talk about shock value. Fox Factory makes suspension products -- i.e., shocks -- for high-performance mountain bikes and other powered vehicles that give riders a smooth ride over rough terrain. Some two-thirds of sales are for shocks for bicycles, but the other third of revenue comes from shocks for ATVs, motorcycles, snowmobiles, and off-road vehicles and trucks. Fox Factory sells its shocks to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as
   <company id="41522">
    Specialized
   </company>
   and
   <company id="47463">
    Trek
   </company>
   (bikes) and
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   and
   <company id="12246">
    Polaris
   </company>
   (powered vehicles). It also sells branded apparel such as T-shirts, sweatshirts, and hats. Fox Factory went public in 2013.

  <p>
   Sales outside the US account for about two-thirds of revenue because Fox Factory sells directly to OEMs that have primary manufacturing operations in Asia. The majority of its own manufacturing operations are in California, but Fox Factory does have a plant in Taiwan. The company is shifting all of its manufacturing to Taiwan by 2016.

   Fox Factory sells its suspension products to more than 150 OEMs and distributes its products to more than 2,300 retail dealers and distributors worldwide. In 2012, 80% of sales were to OEM customers and 20% were to dealers and distributors for resale in the aftermarket channel.

  <p>
   The company has experienced steady growth over the years. Sales increased about 20% in 2012 due to increased demand from both OEMs and aftermarket customers. Fox Factory has also been consistently profitable.

  <p>
   Fox Factory was founded in 1974 by Robert Fox, who built a racing suspension shock in his friend's garage. The company was bought by
   <company id="145180">
    Compass Diversified Holdings
   </company>
   in 2008. In 2013 Fox Factory went public and Compass held onto a majority share; Compass subsequently divested shares in Fox Factory but still maintains a minority ownership stake.
