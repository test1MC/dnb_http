   For those who have an oh-so-bad craving for something chewy and savory, Oberto Sausage has the answer -- its Oh Boy Oberto! meat snacks. The company, founded in Seattle in 1918 by Italian immigrants, makes and markets more than 400 varieties of dried meat products. Its products portfolio is packed with jerky in beef, pork, and turkey versions, as well as snack sausages. They're sold under the brand names Lowrey's Meat Snacks, Pacific Gold Beef Jerky, and Oh Boy Oberto! Privately held by the founding family, Oberto also sells all-natural jerky using no preservatives or artificial flavors. Products are available nationwide and in Canada through supermarkets and club, convenience, and mass-merchandising stores.

   Oberto enlists the help of several sales agencies to distribute its products. It uses
   <company id="59722">
    CROSSMARK
   </company>
   for its US grocery, convenience and gas, and drug and mass merchant customers; S&amp;K Sales Company for the US military channel; and Advantage CKN for the Canadian market. The move was part of Oberto's new direct sales and distribution strategy.

   In addition to selling its products at retail outlets, they can be ordered online through the company's website and large e-tailers. Oberto operates a factory-outlet store in Albany, New York, and has fundraising opportunities.

   During the past few years, demand for Oberto's products has grown. To this end, the food company expanded its production capacity by adding a second facility in Nashville, which it is leasing through an affiliate of
   <company id="55815">
    W. P. Carey
   </company>
   . Supplementing its existing production facility at its headquarters in Kent, Washington, the Nashville plant opened in mid-2013.
