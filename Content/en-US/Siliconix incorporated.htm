   Siliconix's tiny components nix power problems in tiny spaces. The company makes power transistors and integrated circuits (ICs) used to manage and convert power in such products as cell phones and computers, and to control motion in cars and computer disk drives. Siliconix also makes discrete components (low-power transistors) and signal-processing ICs (analog switches, analog multiplexers) used in communication devices, instrumentation, aircraft avionics, and industrial equipment. The company sells directly and through distributors and representatives. Founded in 1962, Siliconix is a wholly owned subsidiary of electronic components manufacturer

    Vishay Intertechnology
   </company>
   .
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Siliconix markets it products worldwide. Customers in Asia account for a significant portion of the company's sales.

  <p>
   The company's MOSFETs (metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors) include the LITTLE FOOT family of small-footprint power transistors. Siliconix continues to develop new products, though development is supplemented by Vishay acquisitions, which add complementary products.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's strategy involves a constant push for innovation and product development to keep pace with the demands of the marketplace.

   Founded in 1962, Siliconix enjoyed a quarter-century of profitability, primarily on the strength of military contracts. During the late 1980s, however, military spending shrank and the company lost a patent-infringement lawsuit. In 1990 it filed for bankruptcy. Soon thereafter Daimler-Benz (later DaimlerChrysler and now
   <company id="58357">
    Daimler
   </company>
   ) doubled its 38% stake in Siliconix, and the company became part of TEMIC, Daimler-Benz's semiconductor consortium. That relationship gave Siliconix access to customers such as IBM and General Motors; by 1992 Siliconix had returned to profitability.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the early 1990s, Siliconix developed a proprietary technology that gouges "trenches" in silicon wafers and can quadruple a chip's capacity for transistors (chips that use this technology are called TrenchFETs).
  </p>
  <p>
   With the popularity of portable electronics increasing demand for its products, in 1997 the company opened a wafer fabrication facility in Germany.
   <company id="11587">
    Vishay Intertechnology
   </company>
   bought an 80% stake in the company from Daimler in 1998, a year in which Siliconix introduced nearly 70 new products. That year EVP King Owyang was named CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Siliconix extended an earlier technology cross-licensing agreement with
   <company id="60890">
    ON Semiconductor
   </company>
   . In 2001 Vishay announced plans to acquire the remaining 20% of Siliconix's stock, but withdrew its bid following a failed tender offer later that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Siliconix established a silicon foundry relationship with
   <company id="43835">
    Tower Semiconductor
   </company>
   of Israel.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company filed a patent infringement lawsuit in 2004 against
   <company id="115648">
    Advanced Analogic Technologies
   </company>
   (AnalogicTech).
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2005 Siliconix acquired a German subsidiary of Vishay and took over a wafer fabrication facility in Itzehoe, Germany. The business and fab had once been part of TEMIC.
  </p>
  <p>
   Vishay again made a bid to acquire the 20% of Siliconix it didn't own in 2005, and it was successful with its tender offer this time, spending $199 million to buy out the minority shareholders of Siliconix.
