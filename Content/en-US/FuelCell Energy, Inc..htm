   FuelCell Energy engages in fuelish pursuits. Founded in 1969 the company develops electrochemical technologies, such as carbonate and planar oxide fuel cells and electrochemical engines, which generate electricity without combustion. The company's commercial products include Direct FuelCell (DFC), which does not need an external hydrogen supply and can be fed fuel directly without an external reactor; the equipment can be fired up with biogas, coal gas, coal-mine methane, diesel, methanol, natural gas, or propane. FuelCell Energy operates more than 50 branded DFC Power Plants for government, industrial, and utility customers around the world. It caters primarily to South Korea and the US.

  <p>
   Most of FuelCell's DFC plants are located in South Korea and supply that nation's electric grid. South Korea represents 67% of its total revenue; the US, 32%.

  <p>
   With the majority of the world's electric power deriving from carbon-based fossil fuels -- the percentage of which is expected to increase for some time -- new power generation products, like the company's fuel cells, are experiencing an increase in demand. What makes FuelCell different from its peers -- those who make PEM, phosphoric acid, and solid oxide fuel cells -- is its manufacturing of carbonate fuel cells. These fuel cells operate at high temperatures (roughly 1,200
   <sup>
    o
   </sup>
   F) and are more resistant to impurities and operate with greater efficiency than phosphoric acid fuel cells. The company believes that it is the only US company engaged in the major development and manufacturing of stationary carbonate fuel cells.
  </p>
  <p>
   FuelCell's DFCs are used in wastewater treatment facilities and breweries, where biogas runs the fuel cells, as well as natural gas pipeline letdown stations, where the DFC-ERG (direct fuelcell energy recovery generation) model, which generates ultra-clean electricity while recovering energy lost during distribution, is targeted for use. DFCs offer cost efficiency, reliability, flexibility in regard to demand and multi-fuel sources, quieter operation, and are more environmentally friendly than traditional power generation options. DFC power generation produces electricity with reduced pollutants, such as nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulfur oxide (SOx), and carbon dioxide (CO2).

   FuelCell has suffered from slumping sales recently in addition to more than a decade of net losses. Revenues fell 10% from $180 million in 2014 to $163 million in 2015. Its net loss improved from $38 million to $29 million during that same time period. The company was burdened by a debt load of $839 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue decline for 2015 was fueled by a decrease in product sales, service agreements, license revenue, and advanced technologies contract revenues. Product sales decreased due to decreased sales of fuel cell kits to
   <company id="42957">
    POSCO
   </company>
   and power plant revenue. Revenue from service agreements and license fee and royalty agreements decreased due to the timing of module exchanges. Advanced technologies revenues in 2015 fell due to the completion of a data center fuel cell power plant research project.
  </p>

  <p>
   Besides Korea, FuelCell is focused on enhancing its competitive position in the US and Europe. The US is a serious market of interest, due in part to the availability of renewable energy incentives. Plus, the California state Public Utilities Commission provides tax incentives for clean energy power generation.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is working on cutting the costs of fuel cell energy production at power plants and increasing its production rate, mainly through partnerships and joint ventures. One such partnership, a 10-year/$10 million manufacturing and distribution agreement (commencing 2009) with Korea-based POSCO Energy, has helped the company enhance its competitive position in the South Korean market, which represented a massive 67% of FuelCell's revenues in 2015.

  <p>
   Created in 1969 as Energy Research Corporation (ERC), a subsidiary of Consolidated Controls, the company was acquired by St. Joe Mineral in 1973. (In 1981 St. Joe became part of engineering giant
   <company id="10594">
    Fluor
   </company>
   .) In 1980 and 1986 ERC signed agreements with
   <company id="41882">
    SANYO Electric
   </company>
   to develop fuel cells. Gurnsey Investors acquired the company in 1988, and a year later ERC entered a licensing agreement with DASA, a German aerospace equipment unit of
   <company id="41231">
    Daimler-Benz
   </company>
   (later transferred to MTU).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 ERC went public, and four years later it began the Santa Clara (California) Project, the world's first demonstration of a utility-scale fuel cell power plant. However, ERC's sales fell after projects were completed and a delay in the passage of the federal budget. ERC signed an agreement in 1997 to license its advanced nickel-zinc battery technology to
   <company id="10409">
    Corning
   </company>
   (ended in 1998) and another agreement the next year with
   <company id="40934">
    Formosa Plastics
   </company>
   and the Chinese city of Xiamen. Also in 1998 ERC formed a joint venture with Xiamen Hi-Tech Innovation Center to develop fuel cells using biomass. The company spun off its battery operations as Evercel and then changed its name to FuelCell Energy in 1999. Evercel went out of business in 2005.
