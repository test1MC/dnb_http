   Detection is a gas for Industrial Scientific. The company makes, sells, rents, and services gas monitoring instruments, systems, software, and related products to detect oxygen and combustible and toxic gases. Its Instrument Network (iNet) tracks the performance of customers' gas monitors and provides status reports as well as instant notification if a problem is detected. Its portable and fixed monitors ("sniffers"), calibration stations, transmitters, controllers, and accessories are designed to work alone or together through iNet. The products are used worldwide in work environments such as underground mines and oil refineries as well as by hazardous response units.

   Industrial Scientific focuses on new product development. In 2016, the company released LENS Wireless, a technology that allows gas monitors to communicate with each other wirelessly. The technology is available with Industrial Scientific's Ventis Pro Series Multi-Gas Monitors and Radius BZ1 Area Monitors.
