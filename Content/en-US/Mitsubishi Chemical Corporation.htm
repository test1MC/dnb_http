  <p>
   Formed in 1994 when Mitsubishi Kasei Corp. and Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co. merged, Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation can trace its beginnings back to 1870 when Yataro Iwasaki, a businessman with samurai blood, founded Mitsubishi as a shipping company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company grew rapidly by purchasing plants from bankrupt companies. During this time the company changed its name many times, finally settling on Mitsubishi. In 1885 Iwasaki lost his shipping company during a political struggle for control of the Japanese marine industry. By then Mitsubishi also operated a financial exchange house, warehouses, coal and copper mines, and a shipyard, and it continued to grow through these diverse businesses. Iwasaki, age 50, died that year, and his brother, Yanosuke, took control of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yanosuke Iwasaki grew the company around its mining and shipbuilding interests but continued to expand its other operations as well. In 1890 he bought 80 acres of swampland near the Imperial Palace and began to develop the real estate that would become Tokyo's central business district. Three years later Yanosuke ceded control of the company to his son, Hisaya, and moved on to become president of the Bank of Japan in 1896.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hisaya, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, divided the company into semiautonomous divisions. Hisaya stressed ethical business dealings during his tenure. His brother, Koyata Iwasaki, a graduate of Cambridge University, took control of the company in 1916. Koyata transformed Mitsubishi divisions into separately incorporated companies. Koyata also oversaw the creation of the company that would become Mitsubishi Chemical: Nippon Tar. Mitsubishi founded Nippon Tar in 1934 and changed its name to Nippon Chemical Industries in 1936. Nippon Chemical grew steadily throughout WWII. Koyata died in late 1945. After the war the Allied powers controlled Nippon Chemical and in 1950 made it a public company, separate from Mitsubishi.
  </p>
  <p>
   While still recovering from WWII, Nippon Chemical profited from the Korean War. In 1952 the company changed its name to Mitsubishi Chemical Industries Ltd. as its ties grew with Mitsubishi once again. When the Korean War ended in 1953, the Japanese economy contracted, forcing Japanese companies to merge. Mitsubishi Chemical absorbed Toho Chemical during this time. In 1956 the company created Mitsubishi Petrochemical Limited.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company built an aluminum rolling mill in 1963 along with its joint venture partner, US-based Reynolds Aluminum. Six years later the company built a coke plant at Sakaide. In 1970 Mitsubishi Chemical again took up the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, which had been suspended during the 1950s. When the oil crises struck in 1973, the company reduced its workforce to remain profitable. Its pharmaceutical operations allowed the company to weather high oil prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Battered by financial losses in 1983, the company suspended dividend payments. Continuing to expand its pharmaceutical operations, the company bought Mitsubishi Yuka Pharmaceutical in 1985 from the Mitsubishi Petrochemical company. The next year profits returned and dividend payments were reinstated.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 the company became Japan's largest chemical company with the merger of Mitsubishi Petrochemical and Mitsubishi Kasei. The keiretsu system backfired on the company in the 1990s, however. With plenty of cheap capital, the company -- as did all keiretsu -- overexpanded in a zero-growth economy. Overcapacity led to pricing pressures and eventually to losses. Dividends were again suspended in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company reorganized its activities in 2005 and started operating as a wholly owned subsidiary of the new holding company. In early 2007 Mitsubishi Pharma merged with Tanabe Seiyaku to create Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, of which it still owns more than half. The next year saw the parent company split off Mitsubishi Chemical's plastics unit as a separate operating subsidiary. That unit produces plastics and films as well as chemicals for semiconductor manufacturing and data storage products such as CDs and DVDs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The reorganization was meant to redefine the company as a performance products and electronics materials manufacturer. Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings now places its petrochemicals segment as its third priority following plastics and pharmaceuticals.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Mitsubishi Chemical acquired Royal DSM's Xantar polycarbonate unit in a no-cash exchange for its Novamid polyamide business. Both companies strengthened their existing units while spinning off non-core businesses. Both Novamid and Xantar had annual revenues of about €90 million ($110 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Mitsubishi Chemical sold its majority share in the Calgon Carbon Japan joint venture back to Calgon Carbon, giving it 80% ownership of the operation. Calgon Carbon acquired the rest of the company in 2011.
