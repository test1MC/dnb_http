   Polycom's vision is a world united by video. The company makes video-conferencing and immersive telepresence (which combines digital audio, video, and content sharing) systems that let users collaborate as if they were in the same room. Its products combine camera, microphone, network connection, and external audio and video devices. The company also offers PC-based phones that transmit both voice and video. Polycom's software enables users to manage conferencing locations and connect with them using ISDN and Internet protocol connections. It partners with the likes of

   Sales for Polycom were down 2% in 2014, the third straight year of declining revenue. One reason for the drop was that Cisco Systems stopped reselling a product it had bought from Polycom. A reduction in operating costs enabled the company to net income of $42 million in 2014 after a net loss of $18 million in 2013. Cash flow from operations increased to $205.4 million in 2014 from $168.4 million in 2013.

   Polycom put acquisitions on hold in 2014. In 2013 it bought Sentri, a managed services provider for Microsoft Lync. The acquisition will help it deliver advanced services for multi-vendor unified communications that offer video, voice, data, and networking.
