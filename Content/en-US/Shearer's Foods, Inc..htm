   Shearer's Foods' potato chips are Shearer perfection. Using Grandma Shearer's "hand-cooked" kettle recipe, the snacks company produces more than 30 million pounds of potato chips each year. Shearer's also makes and markets tortilla chips, cheese curls, corn puffs, pretzels, and pork rinds, as well as dips and salsa. The food maker's products are sold nationwide and through the Shearer's Marketplace Factory Outlet store located across the street from its headquarters in Brewster, Ohio. In addition to the Shearer brand, the firm makes a variety of snacks for private-label customers. Shearer's produces kettle-cooked potato chips for snack-food giant

   Boasting both company- and partner-branded products, Shearer's has become a top provider of snacks within its industry. It benefits from its vertically-integrated system of manufacturing, warehousing, and delivery.
  </p>
  <p>
   With its vast snacks portfolio that includes potato chips, pretzels, pork rinds, salsa con queso, tortilla chips, and rice crisps, Shearer's produces nearly 220 million pounds of snacks throughout almost 80 acres of manufacturing space. The accolades follow the food company's 2011 expansion efforts, which involved investing more than $80 million in its facilities, as well as integrating its purchase of Snack Alliance.

  <p>
   As part of an initiative to make its manufacturing more eco-friendly, the food firm's Massillon manufacturing plant became the first LEED Gold Certified facility of its kind in Ohio.
