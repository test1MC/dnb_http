   Zoltek Companies wants to lighten your load. The advanced materials company makes carbon fibers that can be used in a variety of applications due to their lightweight, high-strength, conductive, and corrosion-resistant properties. Carbon fibers are most common in aircraft brakes, but Zoltek has been expanding their use by employing them in composites for wind turbine blades as well as for use by energy and automotive markets. Zoltek has two segments: heat- and flame-resistant acrylic, or technical fibers (under the brand Pyron), and carbon fibers (under the brand Panex). In 2014 Zoltek was acquired by Japan-based advanced materials and textile maker

  <p>
   Zoltek was purchased by Japan-based
   <company id="52509">
    Toray Industries
   </company>
   in early 2014 and operates as a separate business unit.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Zoltek operates in North America and Europe and sells its products worldwide. The company operates six manufacturing plants: in Nyergesujfalu, Hungary; Guadalajara, Mexico; and in the US (Abilene, Texas; Salt Lake City, Utah; and St. Charles and St. Peters, Missouri).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Zoltek operates through wholly-owned subsidiaries, Zoltek Corporation, Zoltek Zrt. (Hungarian subsidiary), Zoltek de Mexico SA de CV, Zoltek de Occidente SA de CV, Engineering Technology Corporation ('Entec Composite Machines'), Zoltek Properties, Inc. and Zoltek Automotive, LLC. Salt Lake City-based Entec Composite Machines designs and builds composite manufacturing equipment and markets the equipment along with manufacturing technology and materials. In 2013 about 60% of its revenues were derived from products supplied by its operations in Hungary.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to manage its business, it focuses on two separate business segments; carbon fibers, and technical fibers (oxidized acrylic fibers).
  </p>
  <p>
   The carbon fibers segment makes commercial carbon fibers used as reinforcement material in composites. The technical fibers segment manufactures oxidized acrylic fibers and specialty carbon fibers used to manufacture aircraft brake pads and for heat/fire barrier applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Zoltek's corporate and other segment includes the water treatment and electrical services provided by the Hungarian operations and costs associated with the corporate headquarters.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Zoltek has sales offices in the US, Europe, China, India, and Korea. It has an administrative, marketing, and central engineering office in St. Louis, Missouri.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="121333">
    Vestas Wind Systems
   </company>
   , a major wind turbine manufacturer based in Denmark, is a key customer, as is Germany-based Saertex, a manufacturer of fabrics for the composite industry, including materials used to produce wind turbine blades. Together they accounted for 44% of sales in 2013.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's sales decreased by 25% in 2013 due to lower volumes shipped as a result of a decline in customer demand. Carbon Fiber sales dropped by 30% in 2013 primarily due to a decline in sales for wind applications due to the expiration of US tax credits. Technical Fiber sales remained flat.
  </p>
  <p>
   Zoltek's revenues from the US, Europe, and Asia in 2013 declined due to weak demand.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income decreased by 77% in 2013, primarily due to the lower sales, and higher selling, general, and administrative expenses (due to an increase in professional fees relating to legal and audit costs), and increased other expenses (associated with its strategic alternatives evaluation process).
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow decreased by $11 million in 2013 due to increased financing activities, related to the repayments under notes payable and lines of credit (net of repayments) partially offset by decreased purchases of property and equipment.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Zoltek's strategy includes maintaining low pricing levels for its products, accelerating the commercialization of carbon fibers and carbon fiber composites, introducing carbon fiber into various composite manufacturing processes, and expanding the company's available capacity to meet customer demands.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is focused on markets in China, India and Korea, as it begun to see some success through new customers and sales in Asian regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   To commercialize carbon fibers for more uses, Zoltek's research and development group has been designing new equipment and developing new processing methods. The company wants to develop more efficient methods to consolidate the supply chain and open up new market applications. It also is aggressively marketing to expand both existing and new applications of its carbon fibers and to broaden its geographic footprint. The company has added sales personnel in Asia to focus on markets in China, India, and Korea.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to automotive markets, Zoltek has targeted the wind energy, aircraft brakes, deep sea drilling, infrastructure, and thermoplastics industries to increase their use of carbon fibers. A major initiative to produce thermoplastic materials from chopped fibers is now underway to use for automotive parts such as front ends. Thermoplastics are now commonly used in electronics, such as hard disk drives, printers, and medical applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013, Zoltek Companies and Thermoplast Composite GmbH of Germany also joined together to develop and improve carbon fiber thermoplastic tapes and other carbon fiber thermoplastic products, based on Zoltek fibres and using TCG innovative process technologies, for structural applications for automotive and other industries. In an effort to broaden its product offering to wind customers, in 2013, Zoltek Corporation introduced Carbon Fiber Pultruded Profiles as an expansion of its Panex 35 product line, which includes Continuous Tow, Chopped Fibers, Milled Fibers, Carbon Fabrics (stitched and woven), Prepregs, Pultruded Profiles, and Carbon Felts.
  </p>
  <p>
   To further accelerate the commercialization of carbon fibers and carbon fiber composites across a broad range of mass-market applications, the company also has pursued various initiatives, including partnerships with potential users of carbon fibers to act as catalysts in the development of new low-cost, high-volume products.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a part of this effort, in 2012, Zoltek collaborated with Magna Exteriors and Interiors, an operating unit of Magna International, Inc. to develop carbon fiber sheet molding compounds for the automotive industry. The carbon fiber SMC material uses Zoltek's PanexÂ®35 commercial carbon fiber combined with Magna's unique EpicBlendSMC sheet molding compound formulations and production expertise.

  <p>
   Zoltek Companies was founded in 1975 by chairman Zsolt Rumy's father, a former political prisoner in Hungary. In the beginning the company sold, installed, and serviced industrial process equipment. Zoltek began its carbon-based life in 1987 when it acquired Stackpole Fibers, a maker of specialty carbon fibers. Rumy moved production to Missouri and completed Zoltek's IPO in 1992. Two years later it began producing low-cost carbon fiber using a proprietary system that used acrylic fiber. Also in 1994 the company signed deals with TRW (airbags) and BF Goodrich Aerospace (aircraft brakes, now Goodrich).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 Zoltek acquired a bankrupt Magyar Viscosa Rt. (acrylic and nylon, Hungary). Zoltek more than doubled production in 1997 by opening a plant in Abilene, Texas, and by adding two production lines to its Hungarian plant.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was the target of a 1998 SEC probe concerning an earnings report sent to a local brokerage before being made public. In an effort to bridge the gap between composite manufacturer and user, Zoltek made four key acquisitions the following year: Structural Polymer Systems (UK), Cape Composites, Composite Machines Corporation (filament winding and pultrusion equipment), and Engineering Technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its strategy, Zoltek acquired several downstream businesses to create products that use composite materials. However, the acquisitions proved unsatisfactory and Zoltek sold them. Continuing its growth strategy in 2000, the company bought Ramal International and a 45% stake in Hardcore Composites Operations LLC. It also sold Structural Polymer Systems, but negotiated a 10-year supply agreement with the company. The next year Zoltek sold its stake in Hardcore Composites after concluding that the company was struggling financially and made only limited use of carbon fibers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Zoltek restarted manufacturing facility in Texas in 2004 and addedapacity to all of its facilities in 2007. (It increased production from two lines in 2004 to 18 within three years.) That year it also acquired a Mexican facility from
   <company id="95101">
    Cydsa
   </company>
   that will provide raw materials to Zoltek's carbon fibers manufacturing plants. The positive trends led Zoltek to exit some of its traditional acrylic and nylon fibers businesses, discontinuing its former specialty products unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010, Zoltek formed a subsidiary Zoltek Automotive to accelerate the incorporation of carbon fiber products into automotive applications. Zoltek Automotive seeks to lead the commercialization effort in the automotive applications.
