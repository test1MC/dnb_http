  <p>
   Customers include original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), primarily of off-road vehicles. Danfoss Power Solutions also fits its production to the specific needs of the customer, thus minimizing inventory levels, and it maintains its global operations in a decentralized fashion, so that products can be adapted to local market needs.

    John Deere
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10304">
    Caterpillar
   </company>
   included -- are expecting to grow. Danfoss Power Solutions has its eye focused especially on China, where it plans to invest in the construction of several new factories in that country. It is also taking steps to reduce the number of subcontractors to 1,380 (a 70% decrease).
