   Leaving a paper trail is Domtar's business; the company is North America's #1 uncoated freesheet paper manufacturer and marketer. The majority of its sales are from paper, comprising office, commercial printing and publishing, and converting and specialty papers. The lines include offset printing paper, photocopying paper, as well as fine and imaging (security) papers. Its top paper, freesheet (coated and uncoated), is used for a range of printed materials with demanding image and press requirements, such as food packaging, medical, and industrial applications. The company's distribution operations also buys, stores, and sells paper products made by Domtar and other manufacturers.

  <p>
   Domtar is attempting to bounce back after its balance sheet has been stagnating over the course of the last several years. Revenues increased 3% from $5.39 billion in 2013 to $5.56 million in 2014. Profits also more than tripled from $91 million in 2013 to $431 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company attributes the revenue growth due to an uptick in the average selling price for manufactured paper. Domtar was also helped by additional sales from previous acquisitions. The surge in profits was fueled by a decrease in depreciation and amortization and impairment costs and a $200 million tax benefit

   In order to adjust its cost structure, Domtar has been disposing of several underperforming operations. In 2013 the company sold its

   Domtar intends to broaden its product offerings through business acquisitions and alliances. In early 2014 it obtained Laboratorios Indas, S.A.U., a branded incontinence products manufacturer and marketer in Spain. Indas operates two manufacturing facilities in Spain.

   . Also that year, it enhanced its Personal Care segment through the purchase of Associated Hygienic Products (AHP), a supplier of store brand infant diapers. AHP was previously owned by
