   Fellowes makes and markets office products that can organize or obliterate. The leading maker of paper shredders (such as Powershred and Intellishred) also makes binding and laminating machines, records storage products, ergonomic workspace supplies, desk organizers, and computer accessories.

   <company id="110251">
    Body Glove International

   . Its products are sold through office supply retailers and mass merchants, as well as online. Still owned and run by the namesake Fellowes family, the firm was started in 1917 when Harry Fellowes paid $50 for Bankers Box, a maker of storage boxes for bank records.

   Fellowes has expanded its product lineup in recent years through innovations. It rolled out the industry's first line of hands-free shredders, AutoMax, in 2014. In 2013, it added two air purifiers -- one under the AeraMax brand and another under the Fellowes name -- and a Domeo-branded line of accessories for tablet users. Previous product launches include binding and laminating items for its business machines segment.

   The company extends its reach into strategic international markets through joint ventures with other companies. Its partnership with South African distributor, Beswick Office Products (Pty) Ltd., has allowed Fellowes to establish its brand and products in the region. Fellowes owns 49% of the venture, which is named Fellowes Beswick. Fellowes opened its namesake office products manufacturing facility in China in 2011.

   The company ended its joint venture with Chinese manufacturer Jiangsu Shinri Machinery, which commandeered Fellowes' factory in Changzhou, China, in 2009; locked out factory workers; halted product shipments; and stopped payments to vendors. Fellowes was also banned from the Changzhou factory to collect its injection molding tools and other physical and intellectual property, which the company said was of "intangible value." Jiangsu Shinri took over the factory to force Fellowes into changing their contract, whereby control and financial gain of the joint venture would shift to Jiangsu Shinri. Fellowes has said products made in its Changzhou factory generated about a third of its revenues, and the shredder giant has had to find new sources to supply the affected commercial, professional, and SOHO shredders. Though it attracted support from both the US and Chinese governments, the conflict was still ongoing in 2011. Fellowes believes that the court in Changzhou will likely seize and auction its assets there to compensate unpaid vendors, and Jiangsu Shinri looks to be in a position to buy all of the property at a fraction of the market price. (Fellowes was refused participation in the auction process.)
