  <p>
   In 2015 revenue slid by £4.1 milion to £58 million. Sales of Vislink Communication Systems division were down for the year and an increase for Pebble Beach Systems division was unable to completely counteract the drop.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company lost about £900,000, compared to net income of £3.7 million in 2014 because of lower sale and higher costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash outflow amounted to £500,000 in 2015, compared to some £7.7 million of cash generated in 2014.

  <p>
   In 2015 Vislink completed a restructuring intended to make the company more flexible and responsive to changing markets. The company substantially reduced costs and consolidating manufacturing operations and outsourcing the manufacture of established products to third parties. That move should lower its fixed-cost base and increase manufacturing flexibility.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, Vislink launched a new wireless communications product designed for Electronic News Gathering. The product provides secure, bi-directional, high speed data and video, radio network with concurrent connections to each receive sector, all on a single channel within the broadcaster's BAS spectrum.
