   Bush Brothers &amp; Company's success is proof that well-spent ad money makes a difference -- even if you're up against the "big boys" of beans:
   <company id="10287">
    Campbell's
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10388">
    Van Camp's
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="60245">
    B&amp;M
   </company>
   . Not deterred, however, the company turns out more than 40 varieties on bean products and ranks as one of the leading US brands of canned baked beans, Bush's Best -- made from a family recipe. Bush Brothers also cans other beans (black, garbanzo, pinto, refried), chili, greens, peas, and hominy, all of which are sold through retail food outlets and food service operators in the US, Ontario, and Western Canada. Founded as a tomato cannery in 1908 by A.J. Bush, Bush Brothers remains family owned and operated.

   Bush Brothers boasts a bulging portfolio of products. It specializes in baked beans, refried beans, golden and white hominy, recipe beans, and cooked beans. It produces and markets other beans, such as black, pinto, chili, kidney, garbanzo, cannellini, mayokoba, navy, red, white, butter, mixed, cut green, and shelly.

   Company spokesman Jay Bush and his "talking" dog Duke (who is always threatening to reveal the Secret Family Recipe), star in the food maker's popular TV commercials. (The man-and-his-dog duo started doing commercials in 1995.)

  <p>
   Offering some 20 varieties of legumes, Bush Brothers sells one-third of all the canned beans in the US, making the company a worthy rival to well-known bean sellers.
