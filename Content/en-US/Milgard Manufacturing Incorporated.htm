  <p>
   Milgard operates under its parent's "other specialty products" segment, which generated 8% of total sales in 2013. This segment's revenues increased in 2013 primarily due to an uptick in sales volumes of windows in western US markets, a more favorable product mix, and increased selling prices.

  <p>
   Like other home products manufacturers, Milgard's revenue tends to follow the barometer of the nation's economy. Over the years, the company's sales have fluctuated as construction has slowed down, but Milgard has held strong by introducing new products and innovations. It has introduced a line of energy-efficient windows, allowing buyers to take advantage of federal energy tax credits. The company also introduced two new styles for its Style Line Series vinyl windows in 2012.
