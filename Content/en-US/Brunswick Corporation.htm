   Brunswick's business is everyone else's free time. The company is a global manufacturer of marine, recreation, and fitness products. Its largest business segment, marine engines, comprises outboard, inboard, and stern drive engines, propellers, and control systems. The company also makes pleasure craft, sports fishing convertibles, offshore fishing boats, and pontoons. Its fitness segment includes treadmills, cross trainers, stair climbers, and stationary bicycles, sold under brands
   <company id="110517">
    Life Fitness
   </company>
   and Hammer Strength. To focus exclusively on its marine engine and boat business, Brunswick divested its bowling operations in 2014 and 2015.

  <p>
   Brunswick's products are sold throughout North America, South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia. Nearly 65% of the company's total sales are generated outside the US.

  <p>
   Brunswick's primary segments include marine engine (53% of total sales) and boat (29%). The fitness segment (18%) jockeys for the lead in supplying equipment to health clubs, as well as to professional sports facilities, the military and government organizations, hotels, and schools around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Brunswick completed the sale of its retail bowling centers to
   <company id="47504">
    Bowlmor AMF
   </company>
   for $270 million. In 2015 the company sold its remaining bowling products operations to BlueArc Capital Management, a private investment firm based in Atlanta.
  </p>

  <p>
   The marine engine segment's global sales network includes more than 6,000 marine dealers, distributors, and marine retailers and service centers that sell its engines to end-users. Some 3,000 boat dealers and distributors market its lineup of boats. The business' largest dealer,
   <company id="56436">
    Marine-Max Inc
   </company>
   , has multiple centers and delivers about 20% of the boat segment's sales.

  <p>
   Brunswick's balance sheet changed in 2014 as it restructured its operations in conjunction with the divestiture of its retail bowling operations. Revenues climbed 7% to peak at $4.1 billion in 2015, its highest total in at least seven years. Profits, however, fell 2% to $241 million in 2015 due to an increase in pension settlement and impairment charges.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue growth for 2015 was fueled by a 12% spike in boat sales and a 9% rise in marine engine sales. Boat sales increased due to strong growth rates for fiberglass outboard boats and fiberglass sterndrive and inboard boats as well as solid gains in aluminum boats. Segment net sales also reflected higher average selling prices resulting from a favorable shift in mix and an increase in global wholesale unit shipments, both of which reflected the success of new products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Marine engine sales jumped in 2015 mainly due to solid growth in its marine service, parts, and accessories businesses, which benefited from acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2014. The segment also experienced a solid increase in outboard engine net sales, driven by continued favorable retail demand trends and the success of recently launched new products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Brunswick's cash flow from operations in 2015 increased by 30% to $325 million, due to cash inflows from accounts payable, resulting from increased production.

   To keep in check with a slow economy, Brunswick has focused on cutting costs and maintaining a lean operating structure. To focus exclusively on its marine engine and boat business, Brunswick in 2014 completed the sale of its retail bowling centers to

   for $270 million. The next year, the company sold its bowling products business to BlueArc Capital Management, a private investment firm based in Atlanta.

  <p>
   Brunswick has also used acquisitions as a means to attract additional revenue growth. In 2016 the company acquired
   <company id="12117">
    Cybex International
   </company>
   , a maker of commercial fitness equipment, for $195 million. Cybex will be part of the company's Life Fitness Division's portfolio of leading brands. With the addition of Cybex, the company expanded its stable of brands serving the complete spectrum of the commercial fitness market, including health clubs, hospitality, education and military, as well as consumers.

  <p>
   Swiss immigrant woodworker John Brunswick built his first billiard table in 1845 in Cincinnati. In 1874 he formed a partnership with Julius Balke, and a decade later they teamed with H. W. Collender to form Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following Brunswick's death, son-in-law Moses Bensinger became president. The company diversified into bowling equipment during the 1880s. Bensinger's son, B. E., followed as president (1904) and led the company into wood and rubber products, phonographs, and records. (Al Jolson recorded "Sonny Boy" on the Brunswick label.) Brunswick went public after WWI.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1930 Brunswick focused on bowling and billiards, sports that had seedy reputations during the 1920s and 1930s. When B. E. died in 1935, his son Bob became CEO and launched a massive promotional campaign to make his meal tickets respectable.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bob's brother Ted succeeded him as CEO in 1954. Bowling equipment rival AMF introduced the first automatic pinsetter in 1952, and Brunswick followed four years later, capturing the lead by 1958. Brunswick diversified, adding Owens Yacht, MacGregor (sporting goods, 1958), Aloe (medical supplies, 1959), Mercury (marine products, 1961), and Zebco (fishing equipment, 1961). The company adopted its present name in 1960.
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus exclusively on its marine engine and boat business, Brunswick sold all its bowling operations in 2014 and 2015.
