   There's nothing sticky about Sappi. Sappi Fine Paper North America (SFPNA), the dba for S.D. Warren Company, produces fine paper for use in annual reports, magazines, and high-end advertising. SFPNA's high-end paper includes coated specialty and uncoated fine papers marketed under multiple brands, including the mill-branded LOE (Lustro Offset Environmental) paper, the first premium sheet to use 30% post-consumer waste content. It also produces graphic and packaging paper and bleached chemical pulp. Since 1995 SFPNA has operated as a subsidiary of South Africa-based
   <company id="47958">
    Sappi Limited
   </company>
   . It touts a production capacity of 1.3 million tons a year.

  <p>
   SFPNA is headquartered in Boston and has two mill operations in Maine and one in Minnesota. It also operates a coated paper sheeting and distribution facility in Allentown, Pennsylvania.

  <p>
   SFPNA derived about 75% of its net sales from coated wood free paper in 2012; the remainder stemmed from specialty paper and other products. It accounted for 23% of its parent's net sales for 2012; however, its revenues were down 6% for the year due to weaker demand for market pulp and specialties paper.

  <p>
   Cross-selling to a variety of paper interests, SFPNA's portfolio has profited from its "family" of products positioning. Not just for communication, its paper is marketed for longevity (Somerset), environmental appropriateness (Lustro), and economy (Flo).
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to grow, SFPNA and its parent are finding innovative uses for their wood products in overseas markets that extend beyond stationery, tissue, and toilet paper. SFPNA has retrofitted some of its Westbrook mill equipment to produce "release paper," a product used to make clothing, sneakers, soccer balls, handbags, and automobile interiors. The textured release paper is also sold to foreign manufacturers, which apply it to their fabrics.
