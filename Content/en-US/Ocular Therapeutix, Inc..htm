   Ocular Therapeutix develops therapies for eye diseases and conditions. The start-up has several products in development based on its proprietary hydrogel platform technology. The farthest along is OTX-DP, a treatment for ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery. Other products in its pipeline include OTX-TP for glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Benefits of Ocular's hydrogel platform technology include replacing onerous existing care regimens with as little as a single product application. The firm's first commercial product, ReSure Sealant, is a hydrogel-based opthalmic wound sealant. Capitalizing on a hot market for biotech firms, Ocular Therapeutix went public in 2014.

  <p>
   Ocular Therapeutix in July 2014 raised $65 million in an initial public offering. The firm sold 5 million shares priced at $13 each (below its forecast of $14 to $16 per share). The proceeds from the IPO will go toward completing clinical trials for several of its products.

  <p>
   The emerging growth company's revenue fell to $0 in 2013 from $10,000 in 2012. In the first three months of 2014 the firm reported $27,000 in sales. Ocular has lost money every year since its founding, although its net loss narrowed to $13.3 million in 2013 from $14.1 million in 2012.
