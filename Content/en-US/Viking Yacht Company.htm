   Leif Eriksson's oceangoing Viking explorers could only dream of vessels like those made by the Viking Yacht Company. Viking Yacht can build more than 100 semi-custom fiberglass pleasure boats, primarily used for sport fishing. About 90% of each yacht is made in-house. Its line of yachts vary in length from approximately 42 to 92 feet and include convertible and enclosed-bridge convertible vessels, open sportfish models, and a 52-foot sport yacht. The luxury boats are sold through a network of more than 40 dealers, six of which are based outside the US. Founders and brothers Bob and Bill Healey own Viking Yacht Company.
