   Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) makes well-regarded processors for customers such as Hewlett-Packard, Sony, and Dell, but it remains a distant #2 in PC and server microprocessors behind Intel. AMD, in the past, has at times eroded Intel's market share, thanks to its PC-powering Athlon and Opteron processor families, as well as its newer A-series of processors that combine computing and graphics on a chip. But it's the company's embedded processors, enterprise, and semi-custom chips that have come to generate 55% of sales. Most of AMD's sales are from international customers with Japan and China as its biggest markets. The US ranks third.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates through two segments: computing and graphics and enterprise, embedded and semi-custom. Computing and graphics products, accounting for 45% of sales, include AMD's x86 series of chips for PCs and graphic processors game systems and other devices. The products from the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment, 55% of sales, are used in data centers, kiosks, machine-to-machine applications, and security and storage systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   AMD outsources manufacturing of its products to third-party foundries, including

   (GF) and
   <company id="43493">

   , while it performs assembly, test, and packaging of its microprocessor and embedded processors at its own facilities in China and Malaysia.

  <p>
   Japan is the company's largest market, accounting for nearly 31% of sales. China is #2 with 29%. The US, Singapore, and Europe 25%, 9%, and 4%, respectively. AMD saw sales declines in geographic markets in 2015, including a 50% drop in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company more than 50 locations worldwide, about two dozen of them in the Asia-Pacific region.

   The company markets its products through a direct sales force, as well as through a network of independent distributors and sales representatives.

   and

   are its largest customers, each accounting for more than 10% of sales. AMD's top five customers generate about 68% of sales.

   AMD's marketing and advertising expenses have fallen in recent years, dropping to about $158 million in 2015 from $194 million in 2014 and $210 million in 2013.

  <p>
   AMD's revenue tumbled 28% in 2015 to $3.9 million from $5.5 billion in 2014. Revenue from the computing and graphics segment's revenue dropped $1.3 billion in 2015, a 42% decrease, weakened by lower from what AMD termed challenging global macro-economic conditions, especially in the Greater China region, The company also faced increased competition and reduced demand from its OEM in advance of the Microsoft Windows 10 operating system, which was released in mid-2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's loss deepened to $660 million in 2015 from a $403 million loss in 2014. Lower revenue and an increase in restructuring and other special charges (the company reduced headcount about 5%) piled on losses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Negative cash flow was $226 million in 2015, compared to a negative cash flow of $98 million in 2014.

  <p>
   AMD restructured operations in 2015 to simplify its businesses and align resources. The company reduced the number of employees around the world by 5% (that followed a 6% reduction in 2014) as well as outsourcing of some IT activities and application development. The company recorded a $37 million restructuring charge in 2105. It could spend another $14 million on the restructuring effort into 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   Embedded processors will take on even more importance for AMD as the company seeks to build a market in the Internet of Things, the networking of billion of processors and sensors around the world for a variety of uses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Not that AMD is shying away from powerful processors. The company has carved out a niche in processors for gaming applications. in 2015 it teamed with

   and Oculus, a part of

   , to develop a processor for virtual reality gaming. The company's Radeon processors power Dell's Oculus Ready PCs.

   Silicon Valley powerhouse Fairchild Camera &amp; Instrument axed marketing whiz Jerry Sanders, reportedly for wearing a pink shirt on a sales call to
   <company id="10796">

   . In 1969 Sanders and seven friends started a semiconductor company (just as his former boss,

   Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) went public in 1972.
   <company id="41843">
    Siemens
   </company>
   , eager to enter the US semiconductor market, paid $30 million for nearly 20% of AMD in 1977. (Siemens had sold off its stake by 1991). In 1982 AMD inked a deal with Intel that let AMD make exact copies of Intel's iAPX86 microprocessors, used in IBM and compatible PCs.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the mid-1980s the company was developing its own chips. In 1987 AMD sued Intel for breaking the 1982 agreement that allowed AMD to second-source Intel's new 386 chips. Intel countersued for copyright infringement when AMD introduced versions of Intel's 287 math coprocessor (1990), 386 chip (1991), and 486 chip (1993).
  </p>
  <p>
   AMD acquired Monolithic Memories in 1987, broadening its portfolio of memory devices. The company began work on its Submicron Development Center at headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, where crucial work on future products would be done.
