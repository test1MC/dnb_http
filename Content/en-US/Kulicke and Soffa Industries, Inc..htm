  <p>
   Fred Kulicke and Albert Soffa formed a custom engineering business in 1951; five years later, they began developing transistor assembly equipment for Western Electric. The company went public in 1961. In 1970 it opened a manufacturing plant in Israel, but stumbled, and was forced to make drastic cuts. Kulicke's son Scott became product manager in 1975 and saved the firm by developing a computerized wire bonder. He became president and CEO in 1979.
  </p>
  <p>
   After suffering through the industry's boom-and-bust cycles of the 1980s, Kulicke and Soffa (K&amp;S) began making acquisitions in an attempt to insulate itself from market shifts.
