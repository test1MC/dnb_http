   Intersect ENT is developing products to help us all breathe a lot easier. The commercial stage drug-device company caters to patients with ear, nose, and throat (ENT) conditions. Its drug-eluting bioabsorbable implant technology enables a targeted release of therapeutic agents that hold open a surgically enlarged sinus and gradually release an anti-inflammatory steroid over a period of 30 days and are absorbed into the body. Its initial products, PROPEL and PROPEL mini, have been approved by the

    FDA
   </company>
   for use in patients with chronic sinusitis. In mid-2014, Intersect ENT launched an IPO.

  <p>
   In the summer of 2014, Intersect ENT launched an IPO and earned $55 million in proceeds. It is using $7 million of this total to fund the Phase 3 clinical trial of its steroid-eluting implant and $3 million for research and development expenses. The remainder is to be used for sales, marketing, working capital, and general corporate purposes.

  <p>
   The company's direct sales force primarily targets ENT physicians in order to further penetrate the chronic sinusitis market.

  <p>
   Intersect ENT's revenues more than tripled from $5.9 million in 2012 to $17.9 million in 2013. The growth in revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of its PROPEL and PROPEL mini products from 8,400 units to 25,600 units.
  </p>
  <p>
   It suffered net losses of $16.4 million in 2012 and $18.4 million in 2013 as a result of exorbitant operating expenses. After experiencing a loss in operating cash flow in 2012, the company experienced $10 million in cash flow in 2013 due to its higher revenue from the ongoing commercialization of its PROPEL and PROPEL mini products.

  <p>
   Intersect ENT's growth strategy revolves around expanding its sales force and extending the market reach of its steroid-eluting implants into Europe and the Asia/Pacific region. In the US, one way the company plans to expand its commercialization efforts is to establish third-party reimbursement codes for accessing its products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expects its revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors. These include the re-setting of annual patient healthcare insurance plan deductibles and the seasonal nature of allergies and the cold and flu season and related symptoms.
