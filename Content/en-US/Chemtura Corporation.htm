   <company id="10503">
    Ecolab
   </company>
   and

   </company>
   , and among the leading plastics additives maker globally. It makes chemical products that makes other products more durable, safer, cleaner and more efficient. Major industries served include transportation, energy, electronics, and agriculture. Aside from plastic additives, Chemtura holds niche-leading positions in petroleum additives, flame retardants, and swimming pool chemicals. Its other products include urethanes. In 2016 the company agreed to be acquired by
   <company id="122096">
    LANXESS
   </company>
   in a $2.5 billion deal.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Chemtura has operations in North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa, and Asia, with regional headquarters and shared service centers in Rio Clara, Brazil; Shanghai, China; Middlebury, Connecticut, US; and Manchester, UK/Frauenfeld, Switzerland. In 2015 the company operated 20 plants in 11 countries. That year 46% of the company's net sales were generated in North America (US, 43%); 29% in Europe and Africa; 21% in Asia/Pacific; and 4% in Latin America.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates in two business segments: Industrial Performance Products (including petroleum additives and urethane), and Industrial Engineered Products (including a strong diversified position in bromine). The Industrial Performance Products contributed 51% of Chemtura's total revenues in 2015; Industrial Engineered Products, 41%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to its two core segments, its Agrochemical Manufacturing segment (formerly Chemtura AgroSolutions, 8%) represents the ongoing activity with
   <company id="190018">
    Platform Specialty Products Corporation
   </company>
   under supply agreements.
  </p>
  <p>
   (In late 2014 the company had sold its Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform Specialty Products. Under the terms of the sale, it retained most of the property, plant, and equipment used to manufacture products for the Chemtura AgroSolutions business).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Chemtura sells its products to industrial manufacturing customers for use as additives, ingredients or intermediates.
  </p>
  <p>
   Industrial Performance Products are sold through diverse sales channels, including selected distribution channel partners.
  </p>
  <p>
   Industrial Engineered Products are sold via direct sales to monomer producers, polymer manufacturers, compounders and fabricators, fine chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturers, photovoltaic panel and LED producers, oilfield service and electricity generation companies to industry distributors.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 net sales decreased by $445 million due to a drop in Industrial Performance Products and Industrial Engineered Products revenues. The decline in core segment revenues was the result of lower sales volume, unfavorable foreign currency translation, and lower sales prices. The larger portion of the decline in sales volume came from its Industrial Engineered segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chemtura's net income decreased by $627 million in 2015 due to lower sales and a loss on the sale of business partially offset by decreased selling, general, and administrative expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company recognized a loss on sale of business of $4 million (including a working capital adjustment that was settled in the second quarter of 2015 and the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary in Russia in the first quarter of 2015).
  </p>
  <p>
   Net cash provided by the operating activities was $159 million (compared to $78 million cash used for the operating activities in 2014) due to changes in accounts receivable and other current assets.

  <p>
   Chemtura's key business strategies focus on investing in innovation to strengthen new product pipelines and to reduce the cost of products. It is looking to develop products that are sustainable, meet ecological concerns and capitalize on growth trends in the industries it serves. Chemtura is expanding its portfolio through organic growth complemented by acquisitions and mergers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 Chemtura announced that Azelis Americas will be its sole distributor for its pre-polymer urethanes, curatives and polyester polyols product lines in North America. During the year, it also announced the expansion of the low free MDI polyurethane elastomers production capacity at its Latina, Italy facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chemtura has built a multi-purpose manufacturing plant in China. The facility already produces synthetic greases and began production of synthetic lubricants in 2014 and high-performance urethane products in 2015. The company is also expanding in India through acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   They company launched new ULTRALAST thermoplastic polyurethanes technology platform with proof of concept in Callaway golf balls, expanding in 2015 into numerous new industrial target applications identified through market collaborations in the oil and gas, mining, and construction markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Streamlining its operations, in 2014 Chemtura sold its agrochemicals business (Chemtura AgroSolutions) to Platform Specialty Products Corporation, a global specialty chemicals company, for $1 billion. As a result, Chemtura became a pure-play industrial specialty chemical company focused on two segments: Industrial Performance Products and Industrial Engineered Products. These businesses are global leaders in the markets they serve.
  </p>

  <p>
   Growing its portfolio, in 2013 the company acquired UP Chemical's 50% stake in DayStar Materials. As a result, Chemtura owned a 100% of DayStar, which is now a unit of Chemtura's Organometallic Specialties business and a key part of Chemtura's strategy to gain a competitive edge by providing technologically advanced, high-end, greener products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Chemtura sold its antioxidant and UV stabilizers business, including related plants in the US, France, and Germany, to an affiliate of SK Capital Partners, for $200 million. That year, it also agreed sold its Consumer Products business, (including plants in the US and South Africa), to KIK Custom Products for $315 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company formed a joint development agreement with
   <company id="10304">
    Caterpillar
   </company>
   for novel applications of Chemtura's Duracast hot-cast urethane pre-polymer technology for construction and mining equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company agreed to buy the bromine assets of Solaris ChemTech Industries, India's leading manufacturer of bromine and bromine derivatives. In 2011 the company also expanded in India by forming an alliance with the Archean Group, (based in Chennai), to manufacture and distribute bromine and brominated derivatives.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year, Chemtura entered a joint venture with Isagro S.p.A. to share in research and development activities. The 50-50 venture, named ISEM S.r.l., is a $58 million enterprise designed to accelerate the development and commercialization of active ingredients as well as new molecules originated by the joint discovery effort. That same year, it announced another joint venture, this one with Korea-based UP Chemcials. The venture, DayStar Materials LLC, manufactures and sells metal organic precursors for the LED market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chemtura was faced with a significant decrease in sales and a corresponding decline in liquidity in 2009, and filed a Chapter 11 reorganization plan with the federal bankruptcy court. It emerged in 2010 with a strengthened balance sheet and improved cost structure.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company can trace its roots back to the early 20th century and came into its present form through the 2005 merger of specialty chemical heavyweights
   <company id="10417">
    Crompton Corporation
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10674">
    Great Lakes Chemical
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Chemtura is the successor to Crompton &amp; Knowles, which was incorporated in Massachusetts in 1900 and engaged in the manufacture and sale of specialty chemicals beginning in 1954. Crompton &amp; Knowles traces its roots to Crompton Loom Works, which was established in the 1840s.
