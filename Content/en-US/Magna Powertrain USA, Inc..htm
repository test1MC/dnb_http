   The auto sector has showed that a large quantity of new sales will be from customers in India and China and the company is focused on growth in these markets. In mid-2013, Magna Powertrain launched a new facility in the Tianjin Airport Economic Area in China to produce rear axle drive modules and power take-off units for locally assembled Volkswagen and Audi models.

   Also that year Magna Powertrain announced it will invest $12 million to expand its Muncie, Indiana, manufacturing center to be completed in early 2014. The initiative will add equipment for a new automotive component manufacturing and assembly line to accommodate new business from General Motors.

  <p>
   Magna Powertrain also grows by acquisitions fueled by its parent. In 2012 it purchased Germany-based ixetic Verwaltungs GmbH, a manufacturer of automotive vacuum, engine, and transmission pumps with two manufacturing facilities in Germany and one in each of Bulgaria and China. The deal improved its market position in the field of vacuum and transmission oil pumps, and it enhanced its footprint in Europe.
