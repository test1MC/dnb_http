   The company's sales increased by 6% (before the effect of currency translation) in 2012 compared with 2011 on an increase in product sales and revenue from rental equipment and processing fees, offset by a decline in other revenue, including service revenue. Sales of non-alcoholic beverages increased in Australia, and Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, offset by decreases in sales in New Zealand and Fiji. Revenue from alcohol, food &amp; services increased year over year. Profits fell by 22% year over year on higher costs and taxes.

   Coca-Cola Amatil (CCA) re-entered the Australian beer and cider market in late 2013 when it began selling Molson Coors' brands and Blue Moon; Boston Beer Company's Samuel Adams and Alehouse draught beer; Pressman's Cider from the Australian Beer Company, its joint venture with the Casella Group. (It previously sold beer in Australia through its Pacific Beverages joint venture with
   <company id="54451">
    SABMiller
   </company>
   . However, it stopped when it sold its 50% stake in that JV to SAB, after SABMiller took over
   <company id="42414">
    Foster's Group
   </company>
   for $12.3 billion in December 2011.)
  </p>
  <p>
   On the soft drink front, CCA spent 2013 embroiled in a price war with archrival Schweppes, Australia's second largest soft-drink bottler.

  <p>
   To get back into Australia's premium beer market, CCA acquired a Fiji brewery and distillery from
   <company id="42414">
    Foster's Group
   </company>
   through the purchase of a 90% stake in Foster's Group Pacific Limited, for A$58 million (roughly $60.6 million) in 2012. Assets acquired include brewery facilities in Fiji and Samoa and a distillery in Fiji that produces well-known Fijian brands, Fiji Bitter beer and Bounty Rum. CCA plans to invest up to A$15 million (about $15.7 million) to upgrade and expand the facilities in order to export those brands to Australia by the end of 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Fiji brewery and distillery acquisition complements CCA's broader strategy in the Pacific, where it has multiyear distribution agreements with such international beer brands as

    British American Tobacco
   </company>
   (BAT) founded British Tobacco Co. (Australia) in 1904 to handle its tobacco interests in that country. Renamed Consolidated Investment Co. for a few months in 1927 before reverting to its original name, the company grew and diversified into other industries, including communications, insurance, packaging, poultry, and snack foods. Its snack foods division sold brands such as Cheezels, Chickadees, Monster Munch, and Planters nuts. Its poultry brands included Steggles, Table Talk, and Poultry Farms and were marketed by Australian Poultry, a joint venture with Goodman Fielder Wattie.
  </p>
  <p>
   British Tobacco Co. entered the beverage market with the purchase of Shelleys and Marchants in 1964. (The Shelleys brand was sold in 1983.) The company acquired an interest in a Coca-Cola franchise in Perth, Australia, in 1965 and gained control the following year. In 1973 the company changed its name to Allied Manufacturing and Trading Industries Ltd. and shortened it to Amatil in 1977. Between 1966 and 1988 Amatil acquired 14 Coca-Cola franchises in Australia, Austria, Fiji, and New Zealand. By 1989 the company controlled 80% of Australia's Coca-Cola market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Amatil began divesting itself of noncore operations in 1986, beginning with the spinoff of its finance business as Amatil Finance of Australia. The Coca-Cola Company acquired 59% of Amatil in 1989, most of which came from BAT; related to the transaction, the company spun off control of its tobacco operations (W.D. and H.O. Wills) to BAT. Amatil then became Coca-Cola Amatil (CCA) and announced a restructuring focused on expanding the food and beverage operations. It sold its share of Australian Poultry to Goodman Fielder Wattie late that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 CCA exited the communications, packaging, security, and special printing sectors with the sale of Leigh Mardon to Leigh Mardon's senior management and two other firms. CCA also acquired its chief rival, C-C Bottlers, which had been the sole bottler in South Australia, Canberra, and Tasmania. The deal gave it a virtual Coca-Cola monopoly in New Zealand.
  </p>
  <p>
   CCA added European franchises in Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea (1991); Slovakia (1992); Belarus, Slovenia, and Ukraine (1994); and Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia (1995). The company sold its snack foods division to United Biscuits (Holdings) in 1993, leaving beverages as its only business. It added a franchise in the Philippines in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus regionally, CCA demerged its European operations as Coca-Cola Beverages in 1998 and acquired operations in South Korea. Also in 1998 David Kennedy became managing director and Joe Gladden Jr. became chairman of the board in 1999. Efforts to acquire the Australian soft drink operations of Cadbury Schweppes were blocked by regulators in 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   The bottler sold its Philippines operations to
   <company id="41836">
    San Miguel
   </company>
   and Coca-Cola in July 2001. Terry Davis succeeded Kennedy and became managing director in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later that year, CCA and The Coca-Cola Bottling Company purchased New Zealand's Rio Beverages, maker of Keri fruit juice and Kiwi Blue mineral water. In 2004 CCA became the sole provider of Coca-Cola products in Australia with the purchase of assets from the Australian division of
   <company id="91715">
    Parmalat
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking for growth beyond traditional carbonated colas, the company acquired Neverfail Springwater Ltd. in 2003 and SPC Ardmona, an Australian producer of canned food, in 2004. The Ardmona purchase added such food products as canned tomatoes, beans, and pasta to CCA's roster. Continuing to its food holdings, in 2005 it acquired the Grinders Coffee Group.
