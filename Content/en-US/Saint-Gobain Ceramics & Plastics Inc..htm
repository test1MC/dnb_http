   <company id="40729">
    Compagnie de Saint-Gobain

  <p>
   The parent company reported that Performance Plastics sales grew in all markets in 2013 (except solar), particularly in transportation, medical equipment, habitat, and energy, lifted by new products and a push to co-develop products with customers. Ceramic Materials reported very weak demand in the glass furnace refractories segment, particularly for Liquid Cristal Display (LCD) glass, as well as in the solar and metallurgy segments (not offset by a favorable market for catalyst substrates and zirconium-based abrasives). However, energy markets reported a significant growth in volume.
  </p>
  <p>
   The High Performance materials business contributed about 48% of the Innovative Materials segment's revenues in 2013. The Innovative Materials segment accounted for 22% of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain's total revenues that year.
