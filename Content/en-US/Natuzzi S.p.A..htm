   Natuzzi has a place for your tushy. One of the world's top makers of leather-upholstered furniture, it boasts a leading market share in North America and Europe. Its wares include armchairs, recliners, sofas, and sectionals. Natuzzi operates factories in Italy, Romania, Brazil, and China, and some 430 Natuzzi galleries worldwide. The firm sells its furniture through some 110 stores in Italy under the Natuzzi and Divani &amp; Divani by Natuzzi banners, about 20 UK concessions, and a handful of Italsofa stores in China. In the US, it primarily wholesales to major retailers and sells through about 190 licensed and franchised stores. Founder, chairman, and CEO Pasquale Natuzzi and his family own about half of the firm.

  <p>
   The story of Natuzzi (formerly Industrie Natuzzi) is the story of the industrious Pasquale Natuzzi. Born the son of a cabinetmaker, young Pasquale worked for his father in the city of Taranto on Italy's southern Adriatic coast. Soon, however, he became enamored of the labors of the merchant next door, a furniture upholsterer. By 1956 he had formed his own small upholstery business, making basic sofas for the local people. He was 16 years old.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1962, Pasquale and his 12 employees moved his factory from Taranto to Matera. Before fire destroyed his factory in August 1973, he and 50 employees were turning out 5,000 furniture groups per year.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the end of the year, Pasquale had rebuilt his factory and decided to branch out into new lines of business. In 1976 he seized upon the idea that would make his fortune. He noticed that leather sofas were selling in Europe for five times as much than his fabric-covered couches. Natuzzi was intrigued because the cost of leather was not much more than what he paid for fabric. Soon he was producing nothing but leather furniture, establishing himself as a high volume, low cost specialist. Europe began to take note, as did Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1982 Pasquale traveled to New York City for the first time and was shocked at the expense of leather couches. Even figuring the cost of shipping, customs, and other expenses, he quoted Macy's a price of $445 per couch. Macy's ordered a hundred and sold them almost instantly for $999.
  </p>
  <p>
   Between 1983 and 1989 sales grew by more than 40% each year as he signed up customers like department stores Dillard's, Bloomingdale's, and Burdines, as well as furniture retailer Levitz.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 the company opened a chain of franchised stores in Italy, Divani &amp; Divani, partly to reduce its dependence on US sales. The chain grew to more than 75 stores within the first year. In 1993 Industrie Natuzzi went public and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 Natuzzi bought a controlling interest in upholstered-furniture maker Spagnesi, deciding that entering the fabric-upholstered furniture business was its best opportunity for continued growth. The fabric-covered line, sold primarily in Europe, was launched in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company again broadened it product line by introducing a complementary collection of coffee tables, lamps, rugs, and accessories, produced by third parties, in 1999. In 2000 the company announced it would test market its Divani &amp; Divani chain of franchised furniture stores in the US. The same year it launched Italsofa, a lower-priced furniture line designed to compete in price sensitive markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In May 2002 shareholders approved the change of the firm's name from Industrie Natuzzi to Natuzzi.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded its presence in the UK when it acquired Kingdom of Leather in 2003, but it has since rebranded some of the stores as Natuzzi stores.
