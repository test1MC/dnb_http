   Overall, Chemring Defence UK has seen continued deterioration in demand from its

   customer base. However, during the second half of 2014, significant orders were received from Middle East customers, providing essential base load manufacturing activity for 2015.

   In 2014 the company continued its growth in the production of demolition stores as it commissioned personalized manufacturing facilities for the supply of plastic block explosives to the UK Ministry of Defence. Deliveries under this contract will commence in 2015.
