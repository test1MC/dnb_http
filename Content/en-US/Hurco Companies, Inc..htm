   When it comes to improving automation and productivity, Hurco happily helps. The company designs and makes computerized metal cutting and forming machine tools such as vertical machining (mills) and turning (lathes) centers, as well as the software that automates the machinery. Its machines are manufactured and assembled by Taiwan subsidiary Hurco Manufacturing, using components produced by neighboring contract suppliers. Hurco markets its five-axis machines through its TM/TMM, TMX, and VMX series and other specialty product lines. It sells to customers in the aerospace/military, automotive, computers/electronics, energy, medical equipment, and transportation industries spanning about 50 countries.

   Hurco divides its operations across four product categories: computerized machine tools (86% of net sales), computer control systems and software (1%), service parts (10%), and service fees (3%).

  <p>
   Hurco subsidiaries are located in Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, the UK, and the US. Its manufacturing and distribution facilities reside in the Netherlands, Taiwan, China, and the US. The company derives nearly 55% of its revenues from Europe. About 35% of its sales come from America, and the remainder stems from the Asia/Pacific region.

  <p>
   Hurco sells its products through more than 195 independent agents and distributors targeting the aerospace, defense, medical equipment, energy, automotive/transportation, electronics, and computer equipment sectors. The end-users of its products include precision tool, die and mold manufacturers, independent metal parts manufacturers, and specialized production application or prototype departments within large manufacturing companies.

  <p>
   Hurco's revenues peaked at a record-setting $227 million in 2016. The historic growth was fueled by spikes in sales from service parts (13%) and service fees (7%). It also experienced sizable growth within the Asia/Pacific (26%) and Canada (25%) regions. Service fees revenue increased in 2016 due to additional repair needs from customers in the Americas, the UK, and France. Sales of computerized machine tools increased due to additional revenue from acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income, however, fell 18% from $16 million in 2015 to $13 million in 2016 chiefly due to foreign currency transaction losses. After posting $29 million in operating cash flow for 2015, Hurco posted negative cash flow of $7 million in 2016 due to cash used to fund acquisitions.

  <p>
   Hurco achieved unprecedented revenue growth during 2016 with the help of strategic acquisitions. In mid-2015 it acquired US-based Milltronics Manufacturing Company, a maker of CNC knee mills, toolroom bed mills, vertical machining centers, combination lathes, slant-bed lathes, horizontal machining centers, and bed mills. Through the purchase, Hurco gained ground within the strategic markets of China and Latin America and achieved manufacturing cost reductions from economies of scale and manufacturing efficiencies.
