   In 2015, Radiall posted revenue of about €290 million, a 4% increase from 2014 as foreign currency exchange rates worked in Radiall's favor. The integration of Van-System into its business also boosted revenue. International sales rose about 5% with help from the exchange rate to the US dollar.

   Radiall's net income of about €29 million was off 7% from 2014. Higher costs in 2015 included some non-recurring expenses and a higher budget for research and development.
