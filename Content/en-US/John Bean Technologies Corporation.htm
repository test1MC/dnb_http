  <p>
   In 2014 JBT's revenues increased by 5% due to higher sales in the US and Latin American markets and recurring revenues driven by growth in aftermarket parts and service.
  </p>
  <p>
   JBT FoodTech's revenues grew from acquisitions and growth in protein processing and liquid foods processing equipment. AeroTech's revenues increased due to a growth in fixed equipment products, driven by higher investment in airport infrastructure in North America; and mobile equipment products, driven by demand for our military air conditioning units.
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the last five years, the company's income has been trending opposite to revenues. In 2014 JBT's net income decreased by 7% due to increased expenses (include restructuring expenses) partially offset by higher revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 operating cash flows increased by 27% due to higher inflows from inventories, accounts payable, and trade receivables; offset by an increase in outflows of advance payments, decreased net incomes, and higher pension contributions.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company is pursuing organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions. It is investing in the profitable aftermarket business, and building a dedicated sales and service network which will capitalize on global installed base of equipment. JBT is also looking for opportunities in emerging markets, with a major focus on Asia, where it is establishing a direct presence.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 and 2015 the company began to restructure its operations by consolidating back office operations in the US and Europe, consolidating smaller operations, enabling JBT FoodTech and JBT AeroTech to operate shared facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the company formed the JBT Equipment Finance LLC, a wholly-owned captive equipment finance unit, to complement its financing products in the US and a number of other countries.

  <p>
   Enhancing its core operations through acquisitions is a key growth strategy for JBT. In 2014 it purchased the ICS Solutions business from Stork Food &amp; Dairy Systems. ICS Solutions -- with locations in Amsterdam and Gainesville, Georgia -- provides engineering, installation, and servicing of high-capacity food preservation equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also spent $54 million to buy Wolf-tec, Inc., a New York-based innovative equipment manufacturer providing processing solutions for poultry, beef, pork, and seafood. The deal enables the company to better meet customer needs through an expanded portfolio of protein processing equipment and solutions, and further entry into beef, pork, and seafood processing markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 JBT also acquired Sweden-based Formcook, a regional leader in designing, manufacturing and servicing custom-built industrial cooking and forming technologies for the food processing industry, for about $2 million.

  <p>
   John Bean Technologies was spun off from
   <company id="103275">
    FMC Technologies
   </company>
   in 2008. JBT Corporation takes its name from John Bean, a California inventor who founded Bean Spray Pump Company in 1884, the company which eventually became Food Machinery Corporation (FMC) though a series of mergers and acquisitions in the 20th century. (The original Bean Spray Pump technology was adapted to make a plane de-icer in the 1960s.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2012 JBT's FoodTech division bought container sterilization machinery belonging to H.G. Molenaar &amp; Co (Pty) Ltd., a firm in South Africa. The deal enabled JBT to offer global customers an even broader range of equipment for the canned food industry.
