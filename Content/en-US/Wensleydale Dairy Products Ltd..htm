   When

   characters Wallace and Gromit get a bit peckish, Wensleydale Dairy Products gets busy making more cheese. The small regional (Yorkshire) cheese variety got a big boost in the mid 2000s when movie fans began seeking out Wensleydale cheeses following the release of
   <em>
    Curse of the Were-Rabbit
   </em>
   . Its creamery now produces both the milder white and ripened blue Wensleydale, and distributes other English cheese varieties including Kit Calvert Old Fashioned and Double Gloucester. To honor (and/or shamelessly merchandise) their contribution, the company also markets cheeses with Wallace and Gromit on the label.

   The company sources milk from local family farms, to help ensure the quality and authenticity of Yorkshire Wensleydale cheese.

   The company's Wensleydale cheese has Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status with the EU. PGI status ensures that no other cheese-maker outside the designated area can produce a cheese and call it Yorkshire Wensleydale. (To be classified as a protected food and awarded PGI, a product must be produced, processed or prepared within a specific geographical area and bear qualities, features or a reputation that is attributed only to that region).

   In 2014 Wensleydale Dairy Products launched Crumbly Cheese Slice. It has secured an expanded contract with Sainsburys to offer the stores' regional deli-counters a wider selection of specialty cheeses made in Yorkshire.

  <p>
   In 2014 the company continued its international growth, securing an export deal worth over Â£100,000 to Singapore and Kuwait.

  <p>
   Yorkshire's Wensleydale cheeses were first crafted by Cistercian monks in the 12th century. Commercial cheesemaking began in 1897.
  </p>
  <p>
   A management-led buyout in 1992 resurrected the company, and local production of the cheese resumed.
