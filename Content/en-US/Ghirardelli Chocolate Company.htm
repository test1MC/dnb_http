   Ghirardelli was among its Swiss parent's subsidiaries with the highest sales in 2012. Sales increased 15% (to CHF 351.5 in 2012 from CHF 306.2 in 2011). Driving sales growth in 2012 were the company's popular Squares and the expanding Baking Chocolate segment. The Ghirardelli brand continued to gain market share.

   Along with sister company Lindt (also owned by Chocoladefabriken Lindt &amp; Spruengli), Ghirardelli is one of America's fastest-growing chocolate brands. (The 162-year-old company was established in 1852 by Italian immigrant, Domingo Ghirardelli, who came to the US in 1849, hoping to strike it rich in the California gold rush. When that didn't work out, he turned to chocolate.) To grow, the chocolate maker plans to continue to open new retail outlets, including a shop slated to open in Las Vegas in March 2014. A key sales driver for the company is its individual chocolate Squares. To drive seasonal sales of its Squares, Ghirardelli offers special seasonal limited editions, such as pumpkin and spice in the fall and dark chocolate and strawberry at Valentine's Day. Its best year-round seller is the milk and caramel flavor.
