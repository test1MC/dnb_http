   North America is Oakley's largest market, home to more than 170 Oakley "O" and Vaults stores. The Asia-Pacific region is home to nearly 25 stores (several of which are franchised). Oakley also has a retail presence in Europe, Central and South America, and Africa and the Middle East (all franchises). Oakley's eyewear is assembled in California (where the company is based). It has a second manufacturing facility in Dayton, Nevada.

   Oakley and Ray-Ban are the two biggest eyewear brands in Luxottica's portfolio. In 2015 Oakley accounted for about 11% of its parent company's $9.7 billion in group sales, or about $1.1 billion.

   An innovator in performance optics, Oakley has extended its reach into new niches through partnerships with other key players.
  </p>
        <p>
   Since joing Ray-Ban as a Luxottica house brand, Oakley has been looking for new customers worldwide through brand recognition. The company is working to strengthen its brand, especially in Europe. The plan includes debuting new models of sports and high-performance eyewear, in addition to enhancing its optical and women's collections. It's also designing more models that make use of its sun lens technology, found in some high-performance styles. A big focus for the firm, which makes ski goggles, is European mountain resorts.

        <p>
   Jim Jannard started Oakley (named for one of his dogs) in 1975, selling handgrips for motocross motorcycles from the back of his car. In 1980 he began selling motocross goggles, and in 1983, ski goggles. Oakley moved into the sunglasses market the next year.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company found success with innovative, high-tech designs (including interchangeable lenses, high-optical clarity, and damage resistance) and a selective distribution strategy. It sells through high-end specialty retailers (most accounts are single stores). Oakley avoids mass merchandisers and most department stores, believing that easy availability lowers the perceived value of its products. Operating from a building that flies a skull and crossbones banner, the company vigorously litigates unauthorized distribution or patent infringements.
  </p>
        <p>
   Oakley went public in 1995, and Michael Jordan, who was often seen sporting Oakley sunglasses, signed an endorsement contract soon thereafter. In 1997 it launched a new type of frame called the X Metal and bought One Xcel, a maker of face shields for helmets. Sales sagged in 1997, in part because Oakley's largest customer, Sunglass Hut, had a buildup of inventory. Jannard declined his salary that year.
  </p>
        <p>
   To revive sales, the firm stepped into NIKE's realm by introducing a line of US-made athletic shoes in 1998. It avoided direct competition with the segment leader by limiting distribution to small surf and skate stores.
  </p>
        <p>
   Bill Schmidt, formerly a marketing executive with Gatorade (another Michael Jordan-endorsed brand), was briefly named CEO of Oakley in 1999 but resigned after five months, taking a million dollars with him. Jannard assumed the responsibilities. The company restructured its struggling shoe business in 2000, sending production overseas and spreading distribution to sporting goods stores at a time when those stores were in a slump.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2001 Oakley introduced its first line of ophthalmic-specific eyewear frames, any one of which can be fitted with corrective lenses. That year Sunglass Hut's new parent, Luxottica (owner of the competitive Ray-Ban brand), reduced its orders of Oakley products; Oakley responded with the purchase of sunglasses retailer Iacon (which operates 40 US mall-based stores in the Sunbelt region).
  </p>
        <p>
   Oakley expanded its own O Stores into California, Florida, and Texas, as well as Australia (2001) and Chile (2003). Oakley Vaults is a retail outlet chain located in France, South Africa, and the UK.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company has solidified its position in premium eyewear. It stepped into the fashion eyewear sector with its purchase of Oliver Peoples in 2006 at a cost of some $56 million. Operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary based in Los Angeles, Oliver Peoples brought with it brands (such as Oliver Peoples, Mosley Tribes, and licensed Paul Smith) that complement Oakley's existing portfolio. Oakley's purchase of OSA Holding and its subsidiary, The Optical Shop of Aspen, in 2006 gave the eyeglass firm more than a dozen retail locations (in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, New Mexico, and Missouri) and a strong foothold in the luxury niche.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company was acquired by Luxottica Group S.p.A. in November 2007 for $2.1 billion. The purchase price was some 30 times more than Oakley's anticipated 2007 earnings.
  </p>
        <p>
   In July 2009 David Scott Olivet, who as CEO oversaw the sale of the company to Luxottica. He was succeeded by Colin Baden, president of Oakley since 1999. Olivet was named chairman of the sunglass maker.
