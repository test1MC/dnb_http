   The search for a cozy night's rest may end with Kozee Sleep Products, better known as Dorlux Beds. The sleep-friendly manufacturer produces mattress and bedding furniture. Its products are made locally but distributed across the UK, and parts of Europe, under the Dorlux Postureline, Flexiform, and Easyrest brands. Dorlux mattresses, headboards, and divans are made from such sustainable materials as oak, suede, leather, and brass, and sold through specialty retailers and some chain stores. The company has a factory and trade showroom in Birmingham.

   The company's factory and trade showroom have the capacity to ensure that stock levels are closely maintained to produce seven-day delivery throughout the UK. It also delivers products to retail stores in most parts of UK.

   As part of its strategic focus, Kozee Sleep Products is targeting the independent sector of the more profitable high-end bedding market as it exits underperforming chain stores. The company's customer base is willing to pay for a luxury mattress tailored to its lifestyle and comfort preferences; for example, the Dorlux brand extends to backcare mattresses, extra-sized (tall, short, wide) mattresses, mattresses that zip down the middle and separate into two mini-mattresses, and adjustable contour beds.

   After a brief period of dormancy (so to speak), in 2007 the company was bought out of administration (the UK equivalent of bankruptcy) by Mohammed Zafar, former co-owner of rival Kozee Sleep Beds.
