   While Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSI) deals with blood, there's no crime scene investigation here. Its Orbital Atherectomy Systems (OAS) treat calcified and fibrotic plaque in arterial vessels throughout the leg and heart in a few minutes of treatment time, and address many of the limitations associated with existing surgical, catheter and pharmacological treatment alternatives. CSI's Diamondback 360°, Predator 360°, and Stealth 360° products are minimally invasive catheter systems that help restore blood flow to the legs of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), a condition that occurs when plaque builds up on limb arteries; and address the effects of coronary arterial disease (CAD).

  <p>
   The company operates manufacturing plants in Minnesota and Texas and produces all of its own products, with the exception of the ViperSlide lubricant offering (which is made through a contract manufacturing agreement with
   <company id="138673">
    Fresenius Kabi
   </company>
   ). CSI also markets guidewires made by Japanese medical equipment firm Asahi Intecc under the Astato and Treasure brands through a distribution arrangement.
  </p>
  <p>
   CSI has developed a patented orbital atherectomy technology for peripheral and coronary commercial applications. It has sold more than 200,000 of its PAD Systems to leading institutions across the US. PAD Systems accounted for 74% of fiscal 2015 (June year end) revenues. It has also sold more than 9,000 CAD Systems to institutions across the US. CAD Systems accounted for 15% of revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to the PAD and CAD Systems, the company intends to expand its product portfolio through internal product development and establishment of business relationships with other medical device companies. The company offers multiple accessory products designed to complement the use of the PAD and CAD Systems. Sales of complementary products, primarily ViperWire guidewires and ViperSlide lubricants, represented 11% of revenues.
  </p>

  <p>
   Most of CSI's products are sold and shipped directly to hospitals and clinics. Marketing efforts are directed towards specialty physicians (including vascular surgeons and interventional cardiologists and radiologists) and aim to educate doctors on the usefulness and safety of its catheters as a precursor to more severe surgical procedures, especially when compared to other interventional plaque-removal devices, including angioplasty balloons or stents.
  </p>
  <p>
   CSI sells its products to specialist physicians and hospitals through a direct sales force in the US.

  <p>
   The company has seen a strong growth in revenues over the last five years. In fiscal 2015 revenues increased by 33% due to sales of its CAD Systems (up by $21.9 million) following the system's premarket approval in late 2013. Revenues from its PAD Systems increased $19 million. Other product revenues also increased by $4.1 million, or 25.1% driven by the increased sales of PAD and CAD Systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   CSI is not profitable and has incurred net losses in each fiscal year since its formation in 1989. In fiscal 2015 net loss recovered by 7% to $33 million due to higher revenue. The company also expects to incur significant additional expenses for sales and marketing, research and development and manufacturing as the company continue to commercialize the PAD and CAD Systems and additional expenses as it seek to develop and commercialize future versions of the PAD and CAD Systems and any future products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's operating cash out flow decreased by 17% in fiscal 2015.

  <p>
   CSI is focused on advancing the commercialization of its products, including the expansion of sales and marketing operations to customer segments. The company partially accomplishes this goal by adding new products to its lineup, both through internal research and development efforts and by forming partnerships with other manufacturers. CSI also keeps an eye out for potential strategic acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also focusing on international expansion. It expects to get the CE Mark for the CAD System in fiscal 2016, and approval for the next generation coronary OAS device in Japan in 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   CSI's primary R&amp;D programs aim to create next-generation versions of its PAD systems. In addition, it is conducting clinical trials on the Diamondback 360° system with hopes of gaining approval for the device's use in CAD market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company received FDA clearance for its new ViperWire Advance Peripheral Guide Wire with Flex Tip for its Peripheral OAS; and received FDA clearance for the new 4 French (4 Fr) 1.25 Solid Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS for the treatment of PAD.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year CSI entered into a Design-Build Contract and a Development Services Agreement, as well as various ancillary agreements related to the acquisition of real property located in New Brighton, Minnesota and the development of such property into the company's new corporate headquarters.

  <p>
   The company, formerly Replidyne, changed its name in 2009 after completing a reverse merger with the predecessor Cardiovascular Systems Inc.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prior to the reverse merger, the Replidyne entity (founded in 2000) was a development-stage biopharmaceutical firm seeking to market lead drug candidate faropenem medoxomil, an oral antibiotic developed to treat respiratory tract infections. The company sought
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval for use of the drug in adults and children but was told it would have to go through further clinical trials before it could get the regulatory green light and be commercialized.
  </p>
  <p>
   After that disappointment, plus the loss of funding from development and marketing partner
   <company id="11951">
    Forest Laboratories
   </company>
   , Replidyne systematically laid off most of its workers, halted its development programs, and began seeking strategic options (ending in the agreement to merge with Cardiovascular Systems).
  </p>
  <p>
   The former Cardiovascular Systems was formed in 1989 and gained FDA approval for its first peripheral artery disease (PAD) treatment device, the Diamondback 360°, in 2007. The company had filed a planned IPO in 2008 to fund its operations, but then in 2009 it decided to enter the public market faster by completing a reverse merger transaction with Replidyne.
  </p>
  <p>
   The deal gave Replidyne's former shareholders about 20% of the combined company, while Cardiovascular Systems shareholders received 80%. Replidyne CEO Kenneth Collins was replaced by existing Cardiovascular Systems CEO David Martin.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2009, CSI received FDA approval for its Predator 360° device. As the company's product sales increased, CSI entered into a new lease agreement for a second manufacturing facility in Texas.
