   Innoivation and the regular introduction of new products is key to BEHR's growth model. In 2012 it launched BEHR PREMIUM PLUS ULTRA® Interior Stain-Blocking Paint &amp; Primer in One which combines a multi-purpose primer with innovative paint to offer superior stain-blocking attributes.That year it also offering a new self-priming, zero volatile organic compound (VOC) interior paint. The upgraded self-priming paint seals uncoated or previously painted surfaces without the need for a separate primer-reducing paint times and project labor needs while helping professionals, such as painters, contractors and remodelers, hide imperfections and provide excellent coverage.

        <p>
   Other 2012 innovations included the launch of BehrProSM Web Enabled Business (WEB), a free service that allows pre-qualified professionals to create a customized website to more effectively market their business, and a redesigned Exterior Wood Care Centre (an in-store resource allows consumers to find the right products and learn about proper preparation and execution of projects using for exterior wood)

Users can browse through color families to choose a particular color, or can enter a BEHR color name or number. The app also lets users save their favorite colors and calculate the cost of the paint.
