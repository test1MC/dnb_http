   Consumers Union of United States (CU) inspires both trust and fear. Best known for publishing Consumer Reports magazine, the independent not-for-profit organization also serves as a consumer watchdog through other print publications and the Web (ConsumerReports.org). Its subscription site rates products ranging from candy bars to cars. CU tests and rates thousands of products annually through its National Testing and Research Center. CU accepts no advertising and derives income from the sale of Consumer Reports and other services, and from non-commercial contributions, grants, and fees. CU traces its roots to 1926, when engineer Frederick Schlink organized a "consumer club" to rate products.

  <p>
   CU's magazines, websites, and newsletters have a combined subscription base of more than 8 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   At its headquarters in Yonkers, New York, CU houses the Testing and Research Center, which consists of 50 labs and offices. The organization also has an Auto Test Center in Connecticut; and three advocacy offices, in Washington, DC; Austin, Texas; and San Francisco, California.

  <p>
   CU testifies before legislative and regulatory entities and files lawsuits on behalf of consumers. The organization is governed by an 18-member board. Board members are elected by CU members and meet three times a year.

  <p>
   To preserve its independence, CU does not permit its ratings or comments to be used commercially.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to its
   <em>
    Consumer Reports
   </em>
   publication, CU publishes
   <em>
    ShopSmart
   </em>
   , a magazine aimed at women who want a quick read on consumer items such as food, beauty products, and home and yard products. CU also covers health information through its ConsumerReportsHealth.org website and the Consumer Reports Health Ratings Center. It has a presence in the blogging world with Consumerist.com, which provides snarky coverage of retail markups and shopper complaints. Rounding out its portfolio of offerings, the organization delivers ratings of product categories to smart phones via its Consumer Reports Mobile service.

  <p>
   In 1926 engineer Frederick Schlink organized a "consumer club" (in White Plains, New York), which distributed lists of recommended and non-recommended products. The lists led to the founding of Consumers' Research and a magazine devoted to testing products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Schlink moved the group to Washington, New Jersey, in 1933. In 1935 three employees formed a union. Schlink fired them. Faced with another strike that year, Schlink accused the strikers of being "Red" and responded with strikebreakers and armed detectives. The next year the strikers set up their own organization, the Consumers Union of United States (CU).
  </p>
  <p>
   CU's first magazine,
   <i>
    Consumers Union Reports
   </i>
   , came out three months later and rated products that the fledgling organization could afford to test, such as soap and breakfast cereals. Subsequent issues focused on food and drug regulation and working conditions for women in textile mills.
  </p>
  <p>
   The organization drew the wrath of both
   <i>
    Reader's Digest
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Good Housekeeping
   </i>
   (which accused it in 1939 of prolonging the Depression). The next year the House Un-American Activities Committee put CU on its list of suspect organizations. CU cut staff and dropped "Union" from its magazine title, but circulation remained low until after WWII.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1950, however, Americans began consuming again, helping to boost circulation to almost 400,000. During the 1950s CU published a series of reports on the health hazards of smoking.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1960 CU helped found the International Organization of Consumers Unions (now Consumers International) to foster the consumer movement worldwide. Rhoda Karpatkin was hired as publisher in 1974. During the 1970s CU established consumer advocacy offices in California, Texas, and Washington, DC.
  </p>
  <p>
   Recession and an increase in not-for-profit mailing rates caused the organization to lose money in the early 1980s. CU looked to its readers, who donated more than $3 million. The organization was hit by a 13-week strike in 1984 by union members calling for more say in management.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 CU slapped "not acceptable" ratings on the Isuzu Trooper and the Acura SLX. The next year the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration declared that CU's testing procedure of the Trooper was flawed, but CU stood by its tests of the vehicle.
  </p>
  <p>
   CU hit another bump in 1998 when it was compelled to retract a story on the nutritional value of Iams and Eukanuba pet food. Admitting its test results were incorrect, CU's retraction of the story was something of a rarity -- its last retraction had occurred almost 20 years earlier when the organization retracted a story on condoms.
  </p>
  <p>
   A legal dispute broke out in 1999 between CU and automakers
   <company id="41753">
    Isuzu
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41859">
    Suzuki
   </company>
   , which claimed negative reviews by
   <em>
    Consumer Reports
   </em>
   constituted defamation. The following year a jury found CU guilty of falsely reporting on the Isuzu but declined to impose fines on the publisher. (Suzuki eventually settled its case out of court in 2004.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Karpatkin announced she would step down as president in 2001 and was replaced by chairman James Guest. That same year CU agreed to license its content to Internet portal
   <company id="48043">
    Yahoo
   </company>
   ! Retailer Sharper Image (later
   <company id="14704">
    TSIC
   </company>
   ) sued CU over an article unflattering to the company's popular air purifier device, but a judge threw out the suit in late 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 CU launched
   <em>
    ShopSmart
   </em>
   , a shopping magazine geared at women aged 30 to 45. The next year it launched ConsumerReportsHealth.org and the Consumer Reports Health Ratings Center. In 2009 the company entered the blogging world with Consumerist.com, which it purchased from
   <company id="148341">
    Gawker Media
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year it introduced its Consumer Reports Mobile service, which delivers product ratings to cell phones. Feats for CU in 2010 include discoveries of a potential safety hazard of
   <company id="41889">
    Toyota's
   </company>
   Lexus GX460 and a signal-loss problem with
   <company id="12644">
    Apple's
   </company>
   phone 4, which resulted in a recall from Toyota, and Apple's announcement of a free remedy.
