   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   (GSK),
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="10509">
    Lilly
   </company>
   . The company is focused on expanding its development pipeline through additional partnerships and technology licensing agreements, as well as via acquisitions.

  <p>
   Ligand has two reportable segments: The development and commercialization of drugs using Captisol technology by
   <company id="119251">
    CyDex Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   ; the development and/or acquisition of other royalty revenue-generating biopharmaceutical assets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Captisol is a formulation technology that has led to six FDA approved products, including
   <company id="136200">
    Onyx
   </company>
   's Kyprolis and
   <company id="10188">
    Baxter International
   </company>
   's Nexterone. It is also being developed through a number of clinical-stage partner programs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's pipeline products included HepDirect, Oral Human Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor and IRAK-4 in preclinical stage, and Glucagon Receptor Antagonist, Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator, and Captisol-Enabled Clopidogrel in other phases.

  <p>
   As a development-stage company, Ligand's revenues and net income figures fluctuate from year to year depending on its income from partnerships and licensing agreements. Ligand brings in operational and R&amp;D funding through its development partnerships, either by entering new agreements or by reaching set milestones within existing agreements. It also earns some revenues from royalty payments on drug candidates licensed to third parties that have reached commercialization stages and also through Captisol material sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company reported revenue growth of 56% in 2013 thanks to a more than 100% increase in Captisol sales and a more than doubling of its royalties revenues (primarily due to an increase in Promacta and Kyprolis royalties). This was offset by a decline in Collaborative Research and Development and Other Revenues due to the timing of achievement of certain regulatory milestones and licensing payments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ligand reported net income of $11 million in 2013 over a net loss in 2012 due to an increase in revenues, and a decline in research and development costs (primarily due to the timing of costs associated with internal programs), partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses and an increase in contingent liabilities.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Ligand's growth strategy is focused around increasing licensing, milestone, and royalty fees from its partners. The company's research portfolio contains more than 60 drug candidates, most of which are being developed through partnerships with other drugmakers. Some of the company's targeted areas of collaboration include osteoporosis (with
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   ) and thrombocytopenia (with
   <company id="139393">
    GSK
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company entered into a licensing agreement and research collaboration with Omthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   , for the development of products to treat dyslipidemia, including hypertriglyceridemia.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year partner Pfizer received approval from the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   for DUAVEETM (conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene), for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms  associated with menopause and the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, and partner GSK received FDA Priority Review designation for Promacta/Revolade (eltrombopag) for the treatment of cytopenias in patients with severe aplastic anemia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the FDA granted orphan-drug designation for Ligand's proprietary Captisol-enabled Topiramate Injection for the treatment of partial onset or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in hospitalized epilepsy patients who are unable to take oral topiramate.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013, the company entered into a license agreement with
   <company id="52597">
    Spectrum Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   to enable Spectrum to develop and commercialize Captisol-enabled propylene glycol-free melphalan. It made other partnership and licensing deals in 2013 with Selexis SA, Azure Biotech, CURx Pharmaceuticals, and Sage Therapeutics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding geographically, in 2013 the company signed a license agreement with Ethicor Pharma for the manufacture and distribution of the oral formulation of lasofoxifene in the EU, Switzerland, and the Indian Subcontinent.

  <p>
   Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers partner Brook Byers created Ligand Pharmaceuticals in 1987 to research cancer diagnostic technologies. Byers recruited Howard Birndorf, a serial entrepreneur with whom he had worked on such startups as Hybritech and Idec. In 1989 the company shifted to intracellular receptors after licensing technology from the Salk Institute and became Ligand Pharmaceuticals, named after chemical components that form a coordinated complex around a central atom or ion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Birndorf left in 1991 to help found
   <company id="51261">
    Neurocrine Biosciences
   </company>
   . Ligand went public the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 the company joined with Allergan to form Allergan Ligand Retinoid Therapeutics (ALRT) to focus on retinoid (vitamin A) research. Ligand bought out ALRT in 1997 and got custody of what became Panretin. The firm also formed partnerships with American Home Products' Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories and
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Laboratories
   </company>
   . In 1995 it bought carbohydrate researcher Glycomed.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the late 1990s the firm began building a sales force and beefed up its pipeline by buying the rights to
   <company id="138703">
    Elan
   </company>
   's Morphelon morphine formulation in exchange for 8% of Ligand's stock; Ontak developer Seragen; and Marathon Biopharmeceuticals. The FDA approved Ontak and Panretin in 1999 and Targretin in 2000. That year Ligand sold Marathon's manufacturing operations, opting to focus on R&amp;D, sales, and marketing. The move paid off: Opioid Avinza won FDA approval in 2002. The next year Elan sold all of its shares of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ligand acquired a minority stake in
   <company id="99943">
    Exelixis
   </company>
   after that company bought Ligand's minority stake in drug developer X-Ceptor Therapeutics in 2004; however, Ligand sold its shares in Exelixis over the course of 2005 and 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ligand sold its oncology product line to
   <company id="110266">
    <company id="56282">
     Eisai
    </company>
   </company>
   in 2006. The oncology line included four drugs -- Ontak, Targretin gel, Targretin capsules, and Panretin.
  </p>
  <p>
   To cash in on its earlier hard work, Ligand sold its pain medication Avinza to
   <company id="55029">
    King Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   in 2007. Avinza was co-developed with Elan and had been Ligand's biggest seller. The divestiture, coupled with the previous sale of its cancer drugs, represented the sale of all of Ligand's commercial operations. As part of its refocusing, the company laid off about 75% of its workforce early in 2007, consolidated its operations into one building, and shut down its UK subsidiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   One of the company's
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   -partnered thrombocytopenia treatments, Promacta, was approved by the FDA in 2008 and added another source of royalty income for Ligand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Moving on to new horizons, it expanded its pipeline when it purchased development firm
   <company id="47706">
    Pharmacopeia
   </company>
   in 2008, adding therapies for hypertension, renal disease, muscle wasting, and psoriasis, as well as licensing or development agreements with companies including
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Myers Squibb
   </company>
   , Schering-Plough (later
   <company id="11326">
    Merck
   </company>
   ), and
   <company id="12913">
    Celgene
   </company>
   . Ligand did the same with developer
   <company id="17029">
    Neurogen
   </company>
   in 2009, paying about $11 million of stock to acquire the financially strapped drug developer, adding Neurogen's pipeline of neurological compounds. In early 2010 the company picked up struggling biotech
   <company id="131221">
    Metabasis Therapeutics
   </company>
   for $3 million, adding drug development candidates in areas including hepatitis C (through a partnership with Merck), diabetes, and cholesterol.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company's revenues increased by 28% to some $30 million due to increased income from partnerships including royalties on sales of GSK's thrombocytopenia drug Promacta. Ligand also placed a dab of black ink on its balance sheet (reporting profits of $10 million) due to reduced R&amp;D expenses as a result of a research agreement with Merck that was terminated during the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   To expand internationally, in 2011 Ligand formed a strategic relationship with Chiva Pharmaceuticals to develop certain products for the Chinese market. In addition to partnerships, the company keeps up a steady stream of annual acquisitions to broaden its R&amp;D activities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ligand stepped up its M&amp;A game at the start of 2011 with its $36 million acquisition of Cydex. CyDex brought along its Captisol drug enhancement technology, a handful of Captisol-enabled drugs in development, and several lucrative licensing agreements with other drug makers who add Captisol to their drugs. Since the acquisition, Ligand has entered a number of new Captisol licensing agreements.
