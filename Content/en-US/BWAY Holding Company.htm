   Fueled by fresh capital from the
   <company id="60168">
    Platinum Equity
   </company>
   acquisition, in 2013 BWAY Corporation&#160;purchased Ropak Packaging from the LINPAC Group. Ropak is a North American producer of rigid, plastic shipping containers serving the consumer goods, food processing, construction, dairy, petroleum and other industries.
  </p>
        <p>
   In early&#160;2012, to pay down debt,&#160;BWAY Corporation sold its blow molded plastic bottle business to Ring Container Technologies, Inc.
  </p>
        <p>
   BWAY has&#160;long&#160;maintained a growth strategy fueled by&#160;acquisitions in core and complementary product lines. In the latter part of 2010&#160;the company&#160;borrowed an additional $25 million to help in&#160;purchasing Phoenix Container (for $40.1 million), a maker of steel pails for packaging consumer and industrial products. Hard on its heels, BWAY acquired Massachusetts-based Plastican, a manufacturer of injection molded plastic containers,&#160;via a stock-purchase transaction. The acquisition included four Plastican manufacturing plants in Arizona, Georgia, Massachusetts,&#160;and Texas, and raises BWAY's total capacity to about two dozen manufacturing facilities.&#160;Following the purchase, BWAY slowed down production at Plastican plants to reduce excess inventories, forcing operations to run&#160;at a loss due to unabsorbed fixed costs. Production resumed normal output in 2011.

        <p>
   In 1907 a group of glassmakers from upstate New York moved their business to Brockway, Pennsylvania, and founded Brockway Glass Company. Over the years the company acquired a number of glass product and container businesses, including Monaca Glass (1933), Tigard Valley Glass (1959), Cell plastic (1960), Standard Container (1979), and Captained Plastics (1981). The company changed its name to Brockway, Inc., in 1982.

   </company>
   bought Brockway in 1987 for $750 million. In 1989 a group including Warren Hanford, a former Gaylord Container executive, formed Brockway Standard Holdings and BSI to acquire the metal and plastic container business of Owens-Illinois. The company bought the Monitor (one-piece screw tops) business of Ellis co in 1993, as well as metal-container makers Armstrong Industries and DK Container. Brockway Standard Holdings went public in 1995.
  </p>
        <p>
   Renamed BWAY in 1996, the acquisitive company continued to buy that year, adding Milton Can; the aerosol can business of Ball Metal Food Container; and Crown Cork and Seal's Davies can operation. BWAY's Ohio-based workers went on strike in 1997, and the next year BWAY reached a multiyear nationwide contract with its labor unions. BWAY also expanded its service operations in 1998 by buying the material center services of U.S. Can Corporation.
  </p>
        <p>
   BWAY closed two plants in Ohio and Illinois in 1999 and sold the non-core tinplate services business that came with the U.S. Can acquisition. In late 2000 the company decided to terminate some of its material service center contracts and renegotiate others in an effort to revitalize its material service operations. In order to consolidate operations, in late 2001 BWAY merged its Milton Can Company unit with the company's BWAY Manufacturing subsidiary.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2003 the company was acquired by private investment firm
   <company id="99303">
    Kelso&#160;&amp; Company
   </company>
   ,&#160;in partnership with BWAY's chairman (and then-CEO) Jean-Pierre Ergas, vice chairman Warren Hayford, and other members of management. Later that year, BWAY moved into the plastic container manufacturing industry through its acquisition of SST Industries, a maker of rigid plastic containers.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company acquired North America Packaging Corporation (NAMPAC), a provider of molded plastic pails, tight-head containers, plastic bottles, and drums in mid-2004. BWAY formed a NAMPAC Packaging division by merging NAMPAC with SST Industries later that year.
  </p>
        <p>
   In mid-2006, BWAY acquired the plastic and steel pail business of Canada-based Industrial Containers Ltd. (ICL). Early in 2007, it bought the assets of Canada-based Vulcan Containers, another maker of steel pails. The company consolidated Vulcan's operations into the&#160;ICL Industrial Containers&#160;unit.
  </p>
        <p>
   BWAY&#160;suffered declining year-over-year earnings in 2006 and a&#160;more than a $3 million loss&#160;in 2007. Its results were driven in part by a slump in the home building and remodeling markets -- about one-third of BWAY's sales&#160;were to customers that make housing related products -- and&#160;millions in expenses related to&#160;its mid-2007 initial public offering. (The&#160;IPO included all of the shares held by BWAY's majority&#160;owner, private equity
   <company id="99303">
    Kelso
   </company>
   .)
  </p>
        <p>
   Turning its business around, BWAY consolidated operations, shuttered facilities in Toronto, Ontario, Ohio, and Illinois. The company cut its management and manufacturing workforce, too. Despite the industry&#160;downturn, BWAY managed to&#160;earn more than an $11 million profit in 2008, and nearly double that in 2009,&#160;repositioning the container-maker&#160;as an attractive acquisition.

        <p>
   Developing BWAY's&#160;plastic packaging&#160;business, the company&#160;purchased

    Ball Corp.
   </company>
   's&#160;Newnan, Georgia,&#160;plastic packaging plant and business for $32 million in fall 2009.&#160;The facility specializes in&#160;screw top pail designs, and strengthens BWAY's&#160;position as&#160;a preferred supplier of&#160;injection molded plastic pails.&#160;Earlier in 2009, the container maker picked up Chicago-based&#160;Central Can Company for about $26 million. Central Can, which&#160;makes&#160;various metal and plastic&#160;paint and specialty cans,&#160;considerably&#160;strengthened&#160;BWAY's container portfolio.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company was&#160;acquired by Madison Dearborn Partners (MDP) in mid-2010. The purchase price was approximately $915 million with the assumption of debt.
  </p>
        <p>
   Years later, in November 2012, it was acquired by an affiliate of
   <company id="60168">

   for approximately $1.24 billion.
