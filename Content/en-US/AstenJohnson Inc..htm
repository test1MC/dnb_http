   Formed through the merger of two venerable paper machine clothing makers of European origin, AstenJohnson makes specialty textiles (paper machine clothing, fabrics, and filaments) for the printing and papermaking industries. It also produces mono-filaments used in making paper machine clothing, and specialty fabrics for pulp mills and manufacturers in non-paper industries, such as food processing, petroleum/chemical and mining, and building products. Additionally, it makes specialty drainage equipment, steam-boxes, and moisturizers for papermaking machines.

   Paper machine clothing (PMC) refers to the textile belting that carries paper in its raw state through various processing stages of forming, pressing, and drying. The integrity of PMC is tantamount to the quality of the paper produced, since it is always in contact with the paper throughout all of its processing cycles. The durability of the clothing must be of high and sustainable quality. AstenJohnson makes paper forming fabrics in a variety of meshes: finer mesh fabrics yield a lightweight paper, such as writing, book, and magazine paper, while coarse mesh fabrics produce a heavier grade of paper for such end products as corrugated boxes.

   In 2012 AstenJohnson acquired Paperchine, an engineering and equipment firm, and merged it with the company's own equipment division, JohnsonFoils. It also bought VIB Systems, located in Atlanta and Germany, that year and integrated its operations with Paperchine. VIB Systems made steam equipment and moisturizers to the paper and corrugated sectors.

   In 2013 Paperchine and HTRC Industrial Solutions teamed up to develop new technology to support the day-to-day operations of paper mills.

  <p>
   AstenJohnson was created through the merger of Asten and the JWI Group in 1999. Histories of both companies extend back to the 1800s and 1700s, respectively. Oscar von Asten co-founded the first Belgian-Austrian felt company in Vienna in 1882. That company became Asten &amp; Co. in 1900. JWI was founded in 1790 in the UK as Manchester Wire Works, which supplied some of the first forming "wires" to the earliest paper machines. In 1852 the company was purchased by the Johnson family and subsequently became C.H. Johnson &amp; Sons Limited (and later, JWI Group). Both companies established US operations in the first half of the 20th century.
