   Imerys knows the ins and outs of mining rare resources. The company extracts and processes minerals into various industrial materials used to produce myriad goods in a range of industries. Operations are split into four groups: Energy solutions &amp; specialties (calcium carbonates, graphite powders and specialties for the petroleum industry); Filtration &amp; performance additives (breathable polymer films and diatomite-based products); Ceramic materials (clay roof tiles, minerals for ceramics); and High-resistance minerals (fused minerals and refractory minerals).

   Imerys focuses both on business acquisitions that offer new, complementary activities and on fueling internal growth via product and operational upgrades. Over the last several years, the company has made more than 40 acquisitions; businesses in developing countries account for 20 of them.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company opened its third plant in India at Wankaner, Gujarat to serve local and foreign customers in the Steel, Cement, Power, Aluminum, Fertilizer, and Petrochemical industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Imerys launched 75 new products for the various markets served by its customers. These projects reflected the vitality of the plastics, photovoltaic tile, lithium-ion battery, and organic agriculture markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash, in 2015 the company divested four calcium carbonate industrial sites located in France (Sainte-Croix de Mareuil), in Sweden (Köping), in Italy (Massa), and in the US (Kimberly).

  <p>
   In 2015,the company entered into exclusive negotiations with
   <company id="47385">
    Solvay
   </company>
   to acquire its PCC (precipitated calcium carbonates) division which has plants in Germany, Austria, France, and the UK. This business serves mainly the automotive (polymers, etc.), building (paints, coatings, sealants) and consumer goods markets (health &amp; beauty, etc.) through specialty applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Imerys acquired
   <company id="191763">
    S&amp;B Industrial Minerals SA
   </company>
   , a major player in industrial minerals, from  the founding Kyriacopoulos family and the investment fund Rhône Capital for €525 million. With the S&amp;B purchase comes a considerable clutch of mineral assets totaling some 31 mines, 51 plants, and 28 distribution centers across 22 countries. The Kaolin activity was integrated into the Ceramic Materials business group and S&amp;B's activities were integrated into the Filtration &amp; Performance Additives business group in 2015.

  <p>
   In 1974 IMETAL was created as a holding company for three French metal companies controlled by the Rothschild family. Société Le Nickel (SLN), Penarroya, and Compagnie de Mokta, which all began in the 1800s, dealt primarily in such nonferrous metals as zinc, silver, cadmium, germanium, uranium, and aluminum. The Rothschild clan had helped found Penarroya, and Guy de Rothschild took on the role of chairman in the early 1960s. When metal prices plunged in 1967, Rothschild started building a stake in SLN; he merged the companies before gaining control of Mokta in 1971.
  </p>
  <p>
   IMETAL diversified and gained a foothold in North America by acquiring two-thirds of
   <company id="55601">
    Copperweld
   </company>
   , a tubing, bimetallic wire, and alloy steel company, in 1975. (It later acquired the remainder, but sold the operations in 1999.) During the 1980s IMETAL reduced its dependence on metals -- which new chairman Bernard de Villemejane felt were no longer profitable -- while acquiring companies that produced construction materials (brick, ceramics, clay, and tiling). During this time, Mokta was sold and IMETAL's stake in Penarroya was reduced from 59% to 15%. Building materials acquisitions included Huguenot Fenal (roof shingles), Industrie Regionale du Batiment (10 construction materials companies), Société Gelis-Poudenx-Sans (bricks, shingles), and Groupe de la Financiere d'Angers (slate).
  </p>
  <p>
   By the early 1990s its building materials and industrial minerals operations accounted for about 55% of sales. During 1990 and 1991 IMETAL acquired C-E Minerals and Dry Branch Kaolin from Asea Brown Boveri (now
   <company id="40615">
    ABB
   </company>
   ). In 1993 IMETAL picked up minority stakes in two Chinese mineral companies and obtained complete control over Minven, its Venezuelan subsidiary. The next year the company increased its graphite operations with the acquisition of Lonza Graphites and Technologies, a leading graphite company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Growth continued throughout the decade, with more than 30 acquisitions between 1994 and 1999. IMETAL purchased specialty minerals company English China Clays in 1999; the $1.5 billion deal made it the world's top maker of kaolin. Signaling the end of its metal processing activities, IMETAL sold its Copperweld operations to US steelmaker
   <company id="10874">
    LTV Corp.
   </company>
   for about $650 million that year. (In 2005 Copperweld was acquired by Atlas Tube.) The company also changed its name to Imerys to reflect its shift from metals to minerals.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Imerys bought leading Latin American calcium carbonate producer Quimbarra (including 15 plants in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico) from Praxair. The next year the company finalized a deal worth more than $62 million with
   <company id="10716">
    Hecla Mining
   </company>
   that brought K-T Feldspar and K-T Clay into the Imerys family. In April 2002 the company launched a line of specially engineered kaolins that were shinier and more easily printable for industrial applications than other available clays.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although its financial momentum slowed during the economic downturn, Imerys rebounded in 2010, more than doubling its earnings on a 20% increase in sales over 2009. Repositioned for growth, in 2011 the company spent $340 million for Rio Tinto's talc business (and the world's largest talc producer) Luzenac. Luzenac adds a workforce numbering about 1,000, plus two dozen sites dotting North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The deal enables Imerys dominate opportunities in the polymers, paints, ceramics, and paper industries. In 2010 it purchased an 86% stake in one of Vale's kaolin businesses, Brazil-based Para Pigmentos, giving Imerys an edge in the market for paper and packaging.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reaching into Asia, its Minerals Ceramics, Refractories, Abrasives &amp; Foundry business group acquired Astron China in 2008. The deal netted a giant China-based manufacturer of zircon products and three production sites, deepening Imerys' footprint in a strategic region and its foundry capacity. On its heels, Imerys acquired the European leader in fused- zircon, UCM Group PLC, in 2007. The importance of minerals and abrasives (renamed fused minerals) to the group extends back to 2000 when Imery took over Treibacher Schleifmittel, one of the world's largest producers of fused alumina and bauxite (corundum).
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions in Imerys' Performance &amp; Filtration Minerals business group have included two mica mining and processing companies, Kings Mountain Minerals and Suzorite Mining. The deals reinforce the company's #1 industry position in technical applications for plastics and coatings.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Materials &amp; Monolithics business group has gained market share, as well. Imerys' international alumino-silicate monolithic refractory business, Calderys, bought Svenska Silika Verken AB. Svenska Silika Verken's two monolithic refractories boost Calderys' capacity to serve a swath a Scandinavian industries, from steelmaking to cement, petrochemicals, and incineration.
