   Like the talons of its namesake, Eagle Pharmaceuticals specializes in sharps. The firm develops and commercializes injectable treatments, primarily to address unmet needs in oncology and critical care. The company has five FDA-approved products -- blood thinner Argatroban, malignant hyperthermia treatment Ryanodex, anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac-misoprostol, cancer drug Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection, and leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma treatment Bendeka. Eagle Pharmaceuticals also has a handful of candidates under development. Commercial and development partners include

   Going forward, Eagle plans to keep its US sales and marketing efforts in-house while using partners and third-parties for European distribution.

   In 2014, Eagle changed its fiscal year end from September to December. When combining the revenue for the entire year, the company made $24.7 million in 2014. The following year, revenue rose 168% to $66.2 million. This was primarily due to $45 million in licensing and other revenue, but also largely due to an increase in product sales and a doubling of royalty earnings. The company recognizes licensing revenue from

   </company>
   related to sales of Bendeka.
  </p>

   After years of losing money, and thanks to the increased revenue, Eagle entered the black in 2015 with $2.6 million in net income (compared to a loss of $23.5 million in 2014).

  <p>
   A big part of Eagle's strategy for success is to be ready when the patent expires on a popular drug and release its "new and improved" version no later than the first generic. It feels it can offer a price point and efficacy improvement over the name brand while offering something closer to a brand than the generics. The company intends to leverage its knowledge of the approval process to line up improved drugs for launch. It will partner for European sales and handle domestic sales and marketing itself while continuing to expand its intellectual property portfolio.

   In late 2016, Eagle agreed to buy Arsia Therapeutics for some $30 million plus up to an additional $48 million in milestone payments. That deal will mark the company's entry into the biosimilar market.
