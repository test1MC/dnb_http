   Image-conscious NVIDIA is conscientious about rendering the best images possible. Its products generate images used in many PCs, video game consoles, mobile devices, and super computers. Its high-definition 2D and 3D graphics processing units (GPU) and mobile processors grapple with adversaries such as

   , and

   . The fabless semiconductor company's GPU brands are GeForce, for games, Quadro, for designers and digital artists, and Tesla, for scientists and researchers. The company has 72% share of the market for gaming GPUs. NVIDIA's graphics processors are used in cloud computing and data centers. Its major mobile processor brand, Tegra, is designed not only for mobile devices, but mobile settings such as automotive systems.

  <p>
   NVIDIA has design centers, laboratories, and offices in Australia, Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the UK, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company gets about 70% of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region. Taiwan is its biggest national market, with 34%. Customers from China are 16% of sales with US customers at 13%.

    Sales and Marketing
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   Although the majority of the company's revenue comes from just a few customers (
   <company id="141021">
    ASUSTeK
   </company>
   , its largest customer, accounted for 11% of sales in 2016 (ended January)), many of those clients serve a large number of manufacturers and system builders around the world. NVIDIA also cultivates relationships with software developers who develop applications that could use NVIDIA products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gaming is, by far, NVIDIA's biggest market, accounting for 56% of revenue. The automotive market is small, 6% of revenue, but growing fast, up 75% from 2015 to 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   NVIDIA raised spending on advertising in 2016 to $17 million from $14 million in 2015 and $13 million in 2014.

    Financial Performance
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   NVIDIA reported higher revenue, lower profit, and it generated more cash in 2016 (ended January), compared to 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenue rose 7% to $5 billion in 2016 from $4.7 billion in 2015. The company's gaming business increased revenue 9% from sales of the high-end GeForce products. Cloud demand brought Tesla processors for datacenter applications higher.
  </p>
  <p>
   NVIDIA's profit dipped 2% to $614 million in 2016 from $631 the year before. It closed out its Icera modem business, a process that carried restructuring and other charges.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations rose to $1.2 billion in 2016 from $906 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Strategy
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   NVIDIA has branched out from providing graphics processors for PCs into revving up graphics for cloud computing applications and data centers. It also has introduced its own gaming platform and opened a streaming service for gamers called GRID.
  </p>
  <p>
   NVIDIA's data center product, Tesla (NVIDIA's processor, not the auto) allows companies to deliver graphics-intense programs to mobile employees using almost any connected device. In another sense of mobile, the company's processors run the dashboards and entertainment systems of 41 vehicle models (and 10 million vehicles on the road). Two NVIDIA processors are the brain of the Tesla Model S. The new Tegra K1 can drive camera- or radar-based advanced driver assistance systems, managing systems that monitor driver alertness through a dashboard.
  </p>
  <p>
   In March 2015, the company released Shield, a living-room entertainment device. In a cross promotion of its own products, NVIDIA provided its GRID streaming service to SHIELD users for free for the first three months.
  </p>
  <p>
   NVIDIA proposed to sell its Icera modem operations, which didn't fit into its business plans. Unable to find a buyer, the company shut the unit down, taking a $131 million charge.

   ) when he decided to start his own company at age 30. He co-founded NVIDIA in 1992 with fellow engineers and industry veterans Chris Malachowsky (SVP) and Curtis Priem (former CTO). It was incorporated in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   After its first try at a graphics chip failed miserably in 1995, NVIDIA hit the big time in 1997 when it introduced a graphics processor that set a new industry standard for speed. Good product timing and flawless execution kept the company growing in the years to come: After turning its first profit in 1998, NVIDIA crossed the $100 million, $300 million, and $700 million sales thresholds in successive years.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company made its IPO in 1999. The following year

   chose NVIDIA to supply the graphics chips for its Xbox video game console. Also in 2000 the company overtook archrival

    ATI Technologies
   </company>
   in market share for desktop PC graphics chips.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company made a series of acquisitions in the early 2000s, extending its graphics capabilities.
