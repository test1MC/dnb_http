   Overall sales grew 2% in 2012, despite lower prices per pound for aluminum. That year the company shipped more than 1,033 kilo tons by volume of aluminum products, down from 1,058 kilo tons in 2011. 2012 was also the first year without the Alcan International Network business segment. Constellium sold the specialty chemicals and raw materials supply chain services division to Sweden-based CellMark.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company's strategy involves including making investments in higher-margin product categories, such as its building a state-of-the-art plant to make AIRWARE for aerospace customers. These higher-margin products are designed specifically for certain customers; they're not off-the-shelf materials that can be purchased from a competitor.
  </p>
        <p>
   Constellium is also looking expand in China. Currently the company's two plants in China are joint ventures with Engley Auto Parts.
