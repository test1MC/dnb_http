   , KTC specializes in compact tractors and track loaders, construction equipment, and consumer lawn and garden machinery. The company, founded in 1972, has grown to become a market leader in the nation's under-120 horsepower tractor niche, offering more than 80 models. It has a presence in California, Texas, Ohio, and Georgia. Kubota Credit Corporation U.S.A. offers financing options for the company's products.

   does not report separate financials for its American distributing business, Kubota Tractor Corporation. Kubota Corporation, however, logged nearly 23% in increases -- to Â¥586.7 billion -- in fiscal 2013. Thanks to a recovering North American market, the parent company saw rising sales of tractors due to growth in demand.

   Demand for its products spurred KTC to expand its manufacturing capacity. The company in 2013 opened a new $73-million, 522,000-sq.-ft. plant at Kubota Industrial Equipment in Jefferson, Georgia, that's dedicated to making Kubota's 30- to 50-horsepower compact tractor models.
  </p>
  <p>
   Underscoring its mantra of "Upgrade, innovate, and expand," KTC rolled out three new excavators in 2013, including the KX040-4 and KX018-4 compact excavators, and the U35-4 tight tail swing compact excavator. It also introduced the new Grand L60 Series to its lineup in 2013. The move follows its launches of the eco-conscious Kubota ZP330 commercial mower and the new gas-powered RTV400Ci utility vehicle in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   KTC strengthened its business in the agriculture market in 2014 by debuting a new line of Kubota Hay Tools to supplement its existing portfolio of Kubota tractors, hay implements, and spreaders.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also works to form alliances with other companies to extend its reach. Through a partnership with Terrain King Corporation, M-Series dealers also can become authorized Terrain King Commercial mower dealers. KTC in 2014 formed a strategic alliance with
   <company id="139760">
    ECHO Incorporated
   </company>
   to help that company supplement its sales in the commercial turf and consumer lawn and garden markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   KTC is supported by sister companies Kubota Credit and Kubota Manufacturing of America (manufacturer of Kubota lawn tractors, mowers, sub-compact tractors, loaders, and backhoes), as well as

   (maker of compact gasoline and diesel engines). KTC has also formed a number of strategic alliances that allow dealers to sell implements and attachments made by other OEMs alongside KTC equipment. Such alliances have included
