   In the art of making pills and capsules Mikart pays attention to the details. The company offers contract pharmaceutical manufacturing services, specializing in oral capsule and tablet formulations. Tablets and capsules can be immediate or time-release; the company also makes liquid formulations and provides specialty packaging, including laminated foil, blister, and pouches. Mikart's facilities have the capacity to produce everything from small pilot-scale batches all the way up to full-scale commercial production. Other services include drug development, feasibility studies, and product testing. Mikart will also walk customers through all the required regulatory processes.
