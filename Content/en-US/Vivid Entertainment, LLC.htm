   Vivid Entertainment Group, one of the world's top adult film producers, leaves little to the imagination. Fans of the form know the company best for its Vivid Girls, a gaggle of about a dozen porn starlets who include Jenna Jameson, Briana Banks, and Lanny Barby. Vivid Girls sign exclusive contracts with the company, much like in the bygone days of the Hollywood studio system. Vivid sells its titles to the retail and rental markets and directly to consumers through its online mail-order site. Vivid also distributes films to cable and satellite channels and offers Internet subscribers pay-per-view access. Co-CEOs Steven Hirsch, David James, and Bill Asher own the company that Hirsch and James founded in 1984.

   Steven Hirsch and David James started Vivid Entertainment in 1984. Mimicking the old Hollywood studio system of signing actresses to exclusive contracts, the company introduced Ginger Lynn as its first "Vivid Girl." With talent under key, Hirsch then made veteran porn actor Paul Thomas Vivid's chief director in 1986. (Thomas also had appeared in mainstream films such as
   <i>
    Jesus Christ Superstar,
   </i>
   in which he played Peter.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The company thrived during the 1980s by capitalizing on the growing home video market. Vivid also made a name for itself as its material was often a cut above the competition: In an industry dominated by $7,000-$60,000 features, Vivid films cost upwards of $150,000 to make.
  </p>
  <p>
   Vivid penetrated the mainstream in 1997, giving critics a premier of its
   <i>
    Bad Wives
   </i>
   with all sex scenes deleted. Also that year Vivid signed an agreement with Larry Flynt Publications to produce a line of adult videos under the Hustler brand. In 1998 Vivid made waves by distributing the erotic video featuring former
   <i>
    Baywatch
   </i>
   babe Anderson and Lee. More than 200,000 copies of the taped honeymoon were sold in 1998, making it the best-selling porn video ever.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Vivid acquired adult video channel Spice Hot from Spice Entertainment Companies (a subsidiary of
   <company id="11194">
    Playboy Enterprises
   </company>
   ) for $25 million, which became The Hot Network. Also that year the company entered a joint venture to help market clothes from urban wear designer Ecko Unlimited. The company's "Seven Deadly Sins" was named Film of The Year by
   <i>
    Adult Video News.
   </i>
   In 2000 the company appointed former Playboy executive William Asher president and announced it was considering a public stock offering. It also released interactive DVD titles
   <i>
    Interactive Body Parts
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Interactive Mind Teazzer
   </i>
   that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company sold The Hot Network and The Hot Zone (as well as a third channel, Vivid TV, which was separate from the company but controlled by Vivid's owners) to Playboy for about $70 million. The next year the studio scored a coup, signing star Jenna Jameson from
   <company id="116553">
    Wicked Pictures
   </company>
   . (True to Vivid's strategy of getting mainstream exposure, she later landed a role on
   <company id="47376">
    NBC
   </company>
   's
   <em>
    Mister Sterling
   </em>
   .)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 several of Vivid's starlets were used to promote snowboards from
   <company id="59155">
    Sim Sports
   </company>
   . Three years later Vivid was shocked when Jameson defected to rival Playboy. While the company still has a deal in place to distribute Jameson's videos through 2014, Playboy now owns Jenna's brand and websites.
