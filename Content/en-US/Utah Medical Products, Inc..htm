   Utah Medical Products (UTMD) focuses on expectant moms, new moms, and newborns. The company designs and makes a variety of medical products used in labor and delivery and in neonatal intensive care, as well as products for gynecological and female urinary problems. Products include disposable pressure transducers to monitor blood pressure, intrauterine catheters used to monitor pressure in the womb during high-risk births, and a device that clamps and cuts the umbilical cord and collects a blood sample from the cord. UTMD, which has manufacturing facilities in the US and Ireland, sells its products around the world through a domestic sales force and more than 100 international distributors.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   More than two-thirds of the company's annual sales come from hospitals, outpatient clinics, and physicians' offices in the US. UTMD's neonatal intensive care products include oxygen hoods, aspirators, feeding tubes, and chest-drainage tubes, as well as peritoneal dialysis products for babies and children.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also makes products for assessment and treatment of cervical and uterine diseases and incontinence in women. For example, UTMD's ENDOCURETTE allows tissue sampling in a doctor's office that can rule out precancerous or cancerous conditions, while its LIBERTY System is a battery-operated system that women can use at home to treat and control urinary incontinence. In addition, UTMD makes electrosurgical generators, accessories, and instruments such as speculas, forceps, and hands-free lights.

  <p>
   UTMD is headquartered in Utah with subsidiary FemCare in the UK and manufacturing facilities Ireland. This European base gives the company easier access to its customers throughout Europe and in the Middle East and Africa. International sales account for just over half of total revenue.
  </p>

  <p>
   In the US the company uses its own direct sales force as well as independent manufacturers reps to sell its wares. It sometimes uses specialty hospital distribution companies. In the UK and Australia, UTMD sells directly to customers while it works through medical device and other distributors in the rest of the world.
  </p>

  <p>
   Revenue grew 10% in 2012 due to increased FemCare sales in the US and abroad and an increase in blood pressure monitoring sales. The growth was partially offset by drops in obstetrics and neonatal sales. Net income was up 37% as UTMD improved manufacturing efficiency in the US and Ireland. Cash flow held steady.

  <p>
   To keep growing UTMD focuses on expanding and improving existing products based on customer requests, developing new products, and purchasing products to add to its lineup. Rather than breaking new ground or going through the cumbersome

   The firm expanded its women's health offerings through the acquisition of

  <p>
   Medical equipment maker Utah Medical (UM) was formed in 1978. In 1982 it went public and the next year bought Medicor (vital sign monitors). Medicor co-founder William Wallace -- who was involved in developing many of of the company's patents -- became president in 1987.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 Wallace was charged with breaking income tax and insider trading laws as a result of his 1987 purchase of UM shares, acquired through a third party during negotiations for a supply contract with Baxter Healthcare. Despite his exoneration at trial, Wallace was fired. He struck back with a wrongful termination suit and UM bought out his interest in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   UM was disappointed by its 1995 launch of Cordguard, which harvests umbilical cord cells for later therapeutic use. The next year UM lost its Baxter contract (and about half of its sales). In response, UM opened facilities in Ireland and built its product line with the purchases of Columbia Medical (vacuum-assisted obstetrical delivery systems, 1997) and C. R. Bard affiliate Gesco International (neonatal intensive care products, 1998).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's R&amp;D efforts were disappointing. Its Fowler EndoCurette endometrial tissue sampling device (developed with the Mayo Clinic) did not make it to market in 1999 and the company abandoned development of a fetal pH monitor.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 the company agreed to supply intrauterine pressure catheters to Novation LLC, a purchaser serving 25% of US hospitals. But to escape from the pricing pressures of such contract sales, the company revitalized its internal sales force to sell its products on the basis of quality. Continuing to enhance sales, UM launched an online sales system in 2000. UM acquired Abcorp in 2004; the maker of fetal monitoring belts was a UM supplier prior to the acquisition.
