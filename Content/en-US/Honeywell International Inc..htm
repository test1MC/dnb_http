   Thermostats and jet engines seem worlds apart, but they're the wind beneath Honeywell International's wings. More than a century old, the company is a diverse industrial conglomerate with four segments; the largest are
   <company id="129028">
    Automation and Control Solutions
   </company>
   (ACS -- making HVAC and manufacturing process products) and
   <company id="103315">
    Aerospace
   </company>
   (turbo engines and flight safety and landing systems). Additional segments include Performance Materials and Technology (PMT, formerly Honeywell Specialty Materials, thermal switches, fibers, and chemicals) and Transportation Systems (engine boosting systems and brake materials).
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Honeywell has approximately 1,300 manufacturing, research, and sales offices and facilities; more than 40% of its products are manufactured in Asia and Europe, and the US represents about 62% of sales. Other key international markets are Canada and Latin America.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Honeywell reorganized its segments during 2014 when it sold its Friction Materials business unit (part of its former Transportation Systems segment) to
   <company id="10557">
    Federal-Mogul Corporation
   </company>
   for $155 million. Transportation Systems was later folded into Aerospace (39% of net sales). Other segments include Automation and Control Solutions (ACS; 37% of total sales) and Performance Materials and Technologies (PMT; 24%).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Honeywell distributes its building control products through independent contractors and distributor channels throughout North America. Sales to the US government accounted for 10% of its total sales in 2015, while commercial aerospace OEMs generated 8%. Commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products accounted for 12%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   After posting record-setting revenues of $40.3 billion in 2014, Honeywell saw its revenues drop 4% to $38.6 billion in 2015. Its net income, however, surged 12% from $4.2 billion in 2014 to $4.7 billion in 2015 due to a decrease in direct and indirect material costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue drop for 2015 was fueled by decreases across all its segments. Performance Materials and Technologies sales decreased due to lower organic sales volumes primarily due to weakness in projects and field products and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Honeywell's operating cash flow increased by 9% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to changes in inventories, other current assets, and accrued liabilities.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   For all its segments Honeywell is focusing on several issues and initiatives, including expanding in such emerging area as China, India, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East; managing raw material costs through hedging; staying alert for liquidity issues among suppliers and customers; and controlling costs related to asbestos and environmental matters.Over the last few years it has launched new facilities in China, Malaysia, and India.
  </p>
  <p>
   Honeywell's strategy for this growth also includes both acquisitions and the divestiture of under-performing units. In 2014 Honeywell sold its Friction Materials business unit (part of its former Transportation Systems segment) to
   <company id="10557">
    Federal-Mogul Corporation
   </company>
   for $155 million. Two years later, the company sold
   <company id="111015">
    Honeywell Technology Solutions
   </company>
   to
   <company id="111095">
    KBR
   </company>
   for some $300 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Spurred by an aggressive acquisition strategy (possibly spending $10 billion or more through 2018), the company hopes to increase its revenues to $59 billion by 2018.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   During early 2016, Honeywell was engaged in talks to merge with industry powerhouse
   <company id="11559">
    United Technologies Corp.
   </company>
   in a merger valued at around $90 billion. The talks ended, however, after United Technologies refused to explore the deal further, fearing that the massive transaction could not clear steep regulatory hurdles.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Honeywell completed its $185 million acquisition of
   <company id="46954">
    Datamax-O'Neil
   </company>
   , a global manufacturer of fixed and mobile printers used in a variety of retail, warehouse, and distribution, and health care applications. The addition of Datamax-O'Neil to its portfolio enhanced its position within the global barcode printing segment.

  <p>
   During WWI, Germany controlled much of the world's chemical industry, causing dye and drug shortages. In response,
   <i>
    Washington Post
   </i>
   publisher Eugene Meyer and scientist William Nichols organized the Allied Chemical &amp; Dye Corporation in 1920.
  </p>
  <p>
   Allied opened a synthetic ammonia plant in 1928 near Hopewell, Virginia, and became the world's leading producer of ammonia. After WWII Allied began making nylon, refrigerants, and other products. The company became Allied Chemical Corporation in 1958.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seeking a supplier of raw materials for its chemical products, Allied bought Union Texas Natural Gas in 1962. In the early 1970s CEO John Connor sold many of the firm's unprofitable businesses and invested in oil and gas exploration. By 1979 when Edward Hennessy became CEO, Union Texas produced 80% of Allied's income.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hennessy led the company into the electronics and technical markets. Under a new name, Allied Corporation (1981), it bought the Bendix Corporation, an aerospace and automotive company, in 1983. In 1985 Allied merged with Signal Companies (founded by Sam Mosher in 1922) to form AlliedSignal. The company spun off more than 40 unprofitable chemical and engineering businesses over the next two years.
  </p>
  <p>
   Larry Bossidy, hired from
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   in 1991 as the new CEO, began to cut waste and buy growth businesses. In 1998 alone the company made 13 acquisitions. Late in 1999 the company acquired Honeywell (which dated back to 1906) in a deal valued at $15 billion and changed its name to Honeywell International. Honeywell, after trying to make a go of it in the computer and telecommunications industries, had refocused on its core products lines -- thermostats, security systems, and other automation equipment.
