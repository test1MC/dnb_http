   Champion Laboratories started as Kleen Pak Manufacturing Company, a filter manufacturer, in West Salem, Illinois in 1955. In 1959 it developed an oil filter that revolutionized the industry and won it the business of many OEMs. Collaborations, co-branding, and acquisitions followed, making the company a success.
