   Hu-Friedy Manufacturing Company makes the tools that help keep your teeth in good shape. In business since 1908, the family-owned company makes instruments that dentists and dental hygienists use to numb, probe, scrape, pull, and cut teeth and gums during dental visits. It also makes the Hu-Friedy Instrument Management System, an integrated system for sterilizing, storing, and organizing instruments. The company's 10,000 products, which are sold in more than 75 countries, are for use in general dentistry, dental surgeries, orthodontics, and periodontics. Hu-Friedy sells its products directly to dental offices and dental schools and through equipment dealers worldwide.

   The company grows through building partnerships and by innovation and regular product launches. For example, in 2014, it entered a partnership with Swiss firm Electro Medical Systems (EMS) to become the exclusive distributor of EMS' prophylaxis products in the US and Canada. Also that year, it launched a new line of instruments featuring 17 restorative and eight surgical instruments.

   In 2016 Hu-Friedy introduced its Everedge 2.0 line of scaling instruments with improved edge retention. It also introduced its new cleaning monitors, part of its instrument management line.
