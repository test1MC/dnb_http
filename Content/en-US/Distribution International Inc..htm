   DI grows through making complementary acquisitions to expand its product portfolio and geographic reach. In 2015 DI acquired E.J. Bartells, based in Renton, Washington. E.J. Bartells is a supplier of mechanical and industrial insulation, fabrication, refractory, and HVAC products throughout the Pacific Northwest and Western states.

   To strengthen the company's distribution network in Texas and New Mexico, DI in 2015 acquired Selle Supply Company and sister company PBI Supply. Both are full-line distributors of insulation products and related construction materials, specializing in the lamination of fiberglass insulation for metal buildings. Selle and PBI Supply comprise the largest regional metal building insulation fabricator/distributor in the US.

   Also in 2015, DI picked up Insulation Fabricators (IFI), a fabricator and distributor of thermal and acoustical insulation products. Based in Indiana, IFI expanded DI's Midwestern footprint with additional locations in Ohio and West Virginia. The acquisition also expanded DI's service range and features fabrication capabilities for a wide range of applications such as pipes, vessels, ductwork, and boilers.
