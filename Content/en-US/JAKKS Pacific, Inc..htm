   JAKKS Pacific is a big wheel in toys. The maker of The Original Big Wheel, JAKKS is one of the US's top toy companies. It makes and sells action figures (including licenses for Pokémon, Ultimate Fighting Champion), die-cast and plastic cars, electronic games, dolls (such as Cabbage Patch Kids, Fancy Nancy), pool toys and floats, Halloween costumes and dress-up products, children's indoor and outdoor furniture, and pet toys (including

   JAKKS sells its products through an in-house sales staff and independent sales representatives to toy and mass-market retail chain stores, department stores, office supply retailers, drug and grocery stores, and specialty shops.  The toy maker's three largest customers are
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart Stores
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10440">
    Target
   </company>
   , and Toys "R" Us, which account for 18%, 16%, and 12% of sales, respectively.
  </p>
        <p>
   Outside the US, JAKKS Pacific markets toys based on the MONSUNO TV program in several European countries through an exclusive marketing and distribution deal with Giochi Preziosi Group. The TV series is produced by a joint venture between JAKKS and Dentsu Entertainment USA, a subsidiary of Dentsu, Inc.

        <p>
   JAKKS Pacific's 2012 sales fell to $666 million from $677 million in 2011 and the company was unprofitable. The 2% decline in sales was due to lower sales of Role Play (dress-up), Novelty, and Seasonal Toys, which was offset by increased sales of Traditional Toys and Electronic Products. Decreased unit sales of role play and dress-up toys, including those based on Disney Princesses and Disney Fairies, depressed results, partially offset by increased sales from the recently acquired Maui Toys business. The launch of Power Train, action figures based on the animated TV series Monsuno, and the recently purchased Moose Mountain division boosted results in the Traditional Toys and Electronics segment.

   Sales in the US, the company's largest market by far, fell 6%, while sales in Europe rose 41%. Indeed, 2012 marked the fourth consecutive year of falling sales at the company, which has seen its revenue reduced by about 25% since 2008.

        <p>
   JAKKS has an eye for toys with a shelf life. Indeed, the company seeks to acquire or license well-recognized trademarks and brand names, which the company refers to as "evergreen" brands, that are less vulnerable to fads or trends. It also seeks to spread out its sales over all four quarters -- referred to as "counter seasonalizing" by the company --  whereas most toy makers' business is heavily weighted to the fourth quarter.
  </p>
        <p>
   JAKKS has traditionally fueled its growth through acquisitions that broaden its core toy lines (such as action figures, dolls, toy cars, and role-play products) and extend its reach into new or related categories. The company has also dedicated time to building its collection of licensing agreements.

   In September 2012 JAKKS acquired UK-based JKID, LTD., a developer of augmented reality technology that enhances the play patterns of toys and consumer products, for $1.1 million up front, and $5.5 million payable in five semi-annual payments. In July of the same year it acquired Ohio-based Maui, Inc., a maker of spring and summer activity toys and impulse toys.
  </p>
        <p>
   In October 2011 the company snapped up Hong Kong-based Moose Mountain Toymakers, a maker of ride-on toys and wagons, inflatable toys, play tents, sports arcade and pinball games, and electronic dance mats for $31.5 million. The purchase of Moose Mountain Toymakers also came with familiar characters and brands such as Disney, Fisher-Price, Hasbro, Thomas &amp; Friends, and Sesame Street.
