   Without Panavision,
   <em>
    Iron Man
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Batman: The Dark Knight
   </em>
   wouldn't be much to look at. The company designs, manufactures, and rents out cameras, lenses, and lighting equipment and related accessories to movie and TV production studios. Subsidiary Lee Filters sells lighting, color-correction, and diffusion filters. Other subsidiaries supply lighting systems and develop digital image sensor chips. Panavision has provided the camera system for every James Bond film ever made. It also supplies camera equipment to popular TV series such as
   <em>
    Glee
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    Modern Family, and Two and a Half Men
   </em>
   .

   Panavision's New Filmmaker Program is an ongoing grant program that was started over 20 years ago. The company believes in giving new filmmakers the opportunity to pursue their vision by donating a camera package. Panavision has seen many filmmakers come through the program and continue on in a very successful career, and in most cases they become a regular Panavision customer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through this program, Panavision donates the use of 16mm or 35mm motion picture camera equipment to filmmakers who are making Public Service Announcements (PSAs), Showcase Reels, 'Low-Budget' Independent Features or any other type of short not-for-profit project. The New Filmmaker Program has four 16mm and two 35mm cameras which have been set aside from the rental pool and are permanently attached to the program. Digital cameras may also be considered, based upon availability.
