   Specialty pharmaceutical maker Allergan (formerly Actavis) isn't content with leading a generic life. Although formerly #3 in the global generics market behind
   <company id="52434">
    Teva Pharmaceutical
   </company>
   and
   <company id="132760">
    Sandoz
   </company>
   , Allergan has reinvented itself as a branded growth pharmaceutical. In 2016 the company sold its portfolio of more than 1,000 generic products to Teva for $40.5 billion. Allergan is now focused on expanding the number of branded drugs in its portfolio. These drugs  are principally geared at urology and women's health. In 2016 Allergan and US-based
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   called off their planned $160 billion merger, citing tax reasons.
  </p>

  <p>
   The firm changed its name from Actavis to Allergan three months after acquiring Botox-maker Allergan in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, after acquiring Forest Laboratories, then-named Actavis reorganized its business structure. Its new North American Brands segment was given responsibility for patent-protected and off-patent products sold in North America. The North American Generics and International segment sold and marketed off-patent products in North America and all products, including over-the-counter products in international markets; it also included the third-party business, Medis, a provider of pharmaceutical development services that outlicenses more than 200 products to customers in more than 100 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's former Anda Distribution division -- accounting for about 15% of revenues in 2014 -- focused on distributing generic, brand, and OTC products from more than 350 drug manufacturers to pharmacies, hospitals, doctors' offices, and other health care providers. Distribution was handled by subsidiary Anda, Inc., and its divisions, which stocked more than 12,000 products. In 2016, after selling its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical, Allergan sold Anda to Teva for $500 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Actavis + Allergan Brand portfolio includes franchises in the dermatology and aesthetics, central nervous system, eye care, women's health and urology, gastrointestinal and Cystic Fibrosis, cardiovascular, and infectious disease therapeutic areas.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   As a combined entity, Allergan's global generics business holds leadership positions in North America, Europe, and Asia/Pacific. It holds top 10 positions in more than 30 markets, including the US, Canada, the UK, Russia, and Australia. Among other strong growth regions are South America, South Africa, and Southeast Asia. Allergan's branded drugs business is a leader in urology and women's health in the US and is expanding into Canada, Latin America, and markets outside of the Americas.
  </p>
  <p>
   Allergan has global and US headquarters in Parsippany, New Jersey, and international headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. It maintains about 25 manufacturing facilities and 15 R&amp;D centers. The US contributed about 50% of the company's sales in 2014, down from about 90% in 2011 due to international acquisitions completed in recent years.

  <p>
   The group sells to customers via wholesalers, retailers, and independent distributors, as well as directly to pharmacies, grocery stores, hospitals, clinics, and government agencies. Its largest customers in 2014 were
   <company id="40016">
    Amerisource Bergen
   </company>
   (28% of revenues),
   <company id="10977">
    McKesson
   </company>
   (21%), and
   <company id="12894">
    Cardinal Health
   </company>
   (13%).
  </p>
  <p>
   The Anda Distribution segment distributes to independent pharmacies, alternate care providers, and pharmacy chains; it also sells some products to physicians' offices.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company took the #3 market spot in generics (and the Actavis name) after Watson Pharmaceuticals acquired privately held Swiss-based Actavis Group in 2012. Even before the Actavis/Watson merger, the company saw consistent revenue growth over the past decade from new products, acquisitions, and strategic alliances. The company reported a 51% increase in revenues to $13.1 billion in 2013, primarily due to 335% growth in its North American Brands segment. Those operations grew largely as a result of the Forest Laboratories and Warner Chilcott acquisitions. The other segments also saw growth: Anda Distribution rose 51% (due to higher earnings in the US related to higher volume and sales prices) and North American Generics and International rose 5%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although revenue has been rising year over year, net income has been on the decline since 2012. The company's net loss increased by 117% to $1.6 billion in 2014 due to higher operating expenses, including expenses related to the Forest Laboratories purchase.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations rose 88% that year to $2.2 billion due to numerous factors including a change in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
  </p>

  <p>
   Allergan's strategy is centered on its desire to buy and develop branded drugs that provide higher profit margins. In addition to internal development of new products, Allergan is seeking opportunities to acquire, license, or partner on additional products to keep its business healthy and diverse. Growth in certain overseas markets is looking particularly attractive, especially in emerging markets such as Russia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has a strong commitment to R&amp;D, on which it plans to spend some $1.7 billion in 2015, as it works to develop new products across all platforms. In 2015 it received
   <company id="144161">
    US FDA
   </company>
   approval for Saphris (youth bipolar disorder), Liletta (long-term birth control), Avycaz (abdominal infections and urinary tract infections), and Namzaric (dementia). It also received approval in Europe to market Xydalba for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. The company also launched a generic version of
   <company id="138860">
    Fougera
   </company>
   's corticosteroid Temovate.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm has also shed some operations, mostly units acquired as part of its acquisition streak. In 2015 it sold the respiratory business that it gained through the Forest Laboratories purchase to AstraZeneca for some $600 million. In a similar move, it plans to sell certain of Forest's manufacturing plants and contract manufacturing agreements to private equity firm
   <company id="51545">
    TPG
   </company>
   . It sold a Lincolnton manufacturing facility to G&amp;W NC Laboratories for $21.5 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a major restructuring, Allergan sold its generics business to Teva Pharmaceuticals for $40.5 billion in 2016. It is also selling its Anda Distribution unit to Teva for $500 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the firm opened a regional office in Singapore; that location became the company's headquarters for its Asia/Pacific and Africa regions.

  <p>
   While the dust was barely settled from the 2012 Watson/Actavis Group transaction, Actavis struck another large deal to acquire pharma company
   <company id="57817">
    Warner Chilcott
   </company>
   for some $5 billion in 2013 (quelling rumors that it might be acquired itself by a larger drugmaker). The purchase of Warner Chilcott expanded its specialty pharmaceutical products and gave it a better competitive edge in the niche drug markets of women's health and urology. It also expanded the company's operations into the new niche fields of gastroenterology and dermatology. An added benefit of the deal lied in Actavis' move to Ireland (where Warner Chilcott was based) following the deal; the headquarters move lowered Actavis' tax rate.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, Allergan and Pfizer called off their plans to merge; the failed $160 billion merger would have moved Pfizer's tax base from the US to Allergan's home in Ireland; it would also have created the world's largest drug maker, surpassing
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   . In the light of new US regulations designed to prevent such tax inversion deals, the companies ultimately called off the deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has been no stranger to large deals. In 2014 it purchased drug maker
   <company id="11951">
    Forest Laboratories
   </company>
   for about $28 billion. The move created a global drug powerhouse with branded and generic medications and a strong development pipeline expected to generate revenues of around $15 billion. The following year, Actavis acquired
   <company id="10059">
    Allergan
   </company>
   (maker of Botox and other aesthetic products) in a $66 billion deal. With that transaction, the company became a top 10 global pharmaceutical firm with revenues expected to top $23 billion in 2015. The firm also plans to buy Auden Mckenzie, maker of more than 650 generic medications and some 85 products under development, in a deal which will make Allergan the largest supplier of generics in the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other completed deals include the 2014 purchases of Durata Therapeutics ($724.5 million), Furiex Pharmaceuticals ($1.2 billion), and Silom Medical Company ($103 million). The company also purchased Tretin-X, a product formerly marketed by Onset Dermatologics, from
   <company id="43602">
    Valeant Pharmarceuticals
   </company>
   for $70 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, in the wake of the failed Pfizer merger, Allergan went on a shopping spree. It agreed to buy eye care company ForSight VISION5 for an upfront payment of $95 million plus potential milestone payments. ForSight is developing a peri-ocular ring to deliver drugs and reduce pressure in glaucoma patients. It also bought Vitae Pharmaceuticals, which has a dermatology product pipeline including treatments for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, for $639 million. In an even larger deal, it acquired clinical-stage biopharmaceutical
   <company id="163007">
    Tobira Therapeutics
   </company>
   , which is developing treatments for liver diseases including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); that deal, valued at up to $1.7 billion, added Tobira's Cenic riviroc and Evogliptin development programs. Allergan also acquired Akama Therapeutics, which also has a NASH development program, for $50 million, and Chase Pharmaceuticals, to expand its CNS and Alzheimer's research capabilities, for $125 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year, the company acquired gene therapy company RetroSense Therapeutics for $60 million upfront plus additional milestone payments related to RetroSense's RST-001 development program. The deal boosted Allergan's eye care pipeline; RST-001 is a novel gene therapy that is being studied for the potential treatment of Retinitis Pigmentosa.
  </p>
  <p>
   With no signs of slowing down, Allergan in early 2017 bought
   <company id="45891">
    LifeCell
   </company>
   for $2.9 billion. LifeCell specializes in making soft tissue material for surgical procedures including breast reconstruction. The company is now buying
   <company id="162404">
    Zeltiq Aesthetics
   </company>
   , which makes cooling technology used for body fat reduction, for $2.5 billion.

  <p>
   As a youth, Watson Pharmaceuticals founder Allen Chao worked at his parents' Taiwan drug factory. After earning a PhD in pharmacology in the US and working at G.D. Searle for 10 years, Chao co-founded Watson in 1984 with $4 million raised from family and friends. Watson (an anglicized version of "Hwa's son" -- based on his mother's name) introduced its first generic drug, a furosemide tablet (a diuretic), in 1985. The company went public in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   At first Watson focused on products that posed manufacturing challenges or had limited markets. In the mid-1990s it diversified into drug development in cooperation with other firms, such as Rhône-Poulenc (now part of Sanofi-Aventis). It bought competitors (Circa Pharmaceuticals, 1995) and invested in drug research companies. In 1996 the company launched its first proprietary drug, Microzide, an antihypertensive. Watson acquired Royce Laboratories (generic drugs) and Oclassen Pharmaceuticals (dermatology products) and boosted its sales force substantially in 1997. It also acquired rights to several products, including Dilacor XR.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Watson bought drug-delivery systems maker TheraTech (taking immediate steps to regain control of its transdermal hormone-replacement system) and Rugby Group, the US generic drug unit of Hoechst (now part of Sanofi). The 1999 launch of the company's Nicotine Polacrilax (an off-patent version of the nicotine gum made by SmithKline Beecham, now GlaxoSmithKline) was hampered by SmithKline's claim that accompanying instructional materials breached its copyrights (the courts ruled in favor of Watson in 2000). To boost its research activities, in 2000 the firm bought Makoff R&amp;D Laboratories and Schein Pharmaceutical. Three years later it bought
   <company id="54878">
    Amarin Corp.
   </company>
   's Swedish R&amp;D subsidiary.
