  <p>
   Most of Hon Hai's factories are in Taiwan, where the company is headquartered. It also runs factories in China. The company was to build a plant in India for making Apple products.
  </p>
  <p>
   A third of Hon Hai's revenue comes from the US with 30% originating in Ireland. Customers in China, Singapore, Japan, and Taiwan team up to account for 22% of the company's revenue with other countries generating 6%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 revenue rose 6% from 2014. Sales to customers in the US, Ireland, and Taiwan, increased 18%, 9%, and 51%, respectively. Sales fell to customers in China, Singapore, and Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hon Hai reported a profit gain of 13% in 2015 over 2014 on the higher revenue, an increase in other income, and lower selling expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations surged 27% in 2015 from 2014.

  <p>
   Hon Hai gets about 53% of it revenue in making iPhones and iPads for Apple. It added more work from Apple when it acquired Sharp Corp., which makes displays for Apple products. That's fine when Apple products are selling  like, well, Apple products. But when iPhone sales fell in early 2016, the impact was felt by Hon Hai. The company is working to diversity its customer base within the Internet-Computing-Telecommunications world and developing manufacturing capablities in nanotechnology, heat transfer, wireless connectivity, material sciences, and green manufacturing.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company completed its $3.8 billion deal to buy electronics maker Sharp Corp., which moves Hon Hai higher up the value chain. Hon Hai is expected to cut costs at Sharp and try to rejuvenate Sharp as a maker and seller of top-flight TVs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2016 Hon Hai joined

    Nvidia
   </company>
   , the maker of graphics chips, and
   <company id="100849">
    Quanta Computer
   </company>
   to develop servers with artificial intelligence capabilities. That's in line with Hon Hai's focus on the Internet of Things as one of its strategic focuses.
