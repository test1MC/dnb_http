   If any company has thirst-quenching down to a science, it's Carlsberg A/S, the owner of
   <company id="40715">
    Carlsberg Breweries
   </company>
   : one of the world's leading brewers. In addition to the worldwide brewing operations of its flagship subsidiary, Carlsberg A/S also operates the Carlsberg Research Center, which houses 80 beer-brewing laboratories. Although most of the company's revenue comes from the sale of Carlsberg beers, the group also sells the Tuborg brand (one of the best-selling beers in Norway). The group is controlled by the Carlsberg Foundation, established in 1876 by founder J.C. Jacobsen. The company is majority-owned by the Carlsberg Foundation, which promotes the arts, sciences, and social work in Denmark.

  <p>
   Carlsberg's portfolio of more than 500 brands includes a goodly number of local beer brands, such as Feldschlösschen (Sweden), Okocim (Poland), Wusu (China), and Baltika (Russia). Beyond beer, its soft drink sales are generated mainly from licenses to produce drinks from
   <company id="10359">
    Coca-Cola
   </company>
   , but the company also produces its own soft drinks, cider, and water. Non-beer beverages account for about 15% of the company's sales.

   The company's revenue increased fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year. It claimed about $12.2 billion in revenue for fiscal 2013, up from $11.9 billion in fiscal 2012.

  <p>
   Carlsberg stems from the amalgamation of two proud Danish brewing concerns. Captain J. C. Jacobsen founded the first of these in Copenhagen; his father had worked as a brewery hand before acquiring his own small brewery in 1826. Studious and technically minded, J. C. inherited the brewery in 1835. He opened the Carlsberg Brewery (named for his son Carl) in 1847 and exported his first beer (to the UK) in 1868. J. C. established the Carlsberg Foundation in 1876 to conduct scientific research and oversee brewery operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carl, who conflicted with his father over brewery operations, opened a new facility (New Carlsberg) adjacent to his dad's in 1881. Both men bestowed gifts upon their city, such as a church, an art museum, a royal castle renovation, and Copenhagen Harbor's famous Little Mermaid statue. Father and son willed their breweries to the foundation, which united them in 1906.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tuborgs Fabrikker was founded in 1873 by a group of Danish businessmen who wanted to establish a major industrial project (including a brewery) at Tuborg Harbor. Philip Heyman headed the group and in 1880 spun off all operations but the brewery.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carlsberg and Tuborg became Denmark's two leading brewers. After WWII, both began marketing their beers outside the country. Between 1958 and 1972 they tripled exports and established breweries in Europe and Asia. Both brewers' desire to grow internationally influenced their decision to merge, which they did in 1969 as United Breweries.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1980s the firm diversified, forming Carlsberg Biotechnology in 1983 to extend its research to other areas. It strengthened its position in North America through licenses with Anheuser-Busch (1985) and John Labatt (1988). United Breweries reverted to the old Carlsberg name in 1987.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carlsberg and Allied-Lyons (which became Allied Domecq before being acquired by
   <company id="46900">
    Pernod Ricard
   </company>
   in 2005) combined their UK brewing, distribution, and wholesaling operations under the name Carlsberg-Tetley (now Carlsberg UK) in 1992, creating the UK's third-largest brewer (behind Bass and Courage).
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm teamed up with India's United Breweries in 1995 to distribute Carlsberg beer on the subcontinent. Bass acquired Allied's 50% of Carlsberg-Tetley in 1996 but sold its stake to Carlsberg in 1997 upon orders from regulators. Also in 1997 Carlsberg and
   <company id="10359">
    Coca-Cola
   </company>
   set up Coca-Cola Nordic Beverages to bottle and distribute soft drinks in Nordic countries. That year Poul Svanholm retired after 25 years as CEO; he was replaced by Jørn Jensen.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carlsberg acquired a 60% stake in Finnish brewer Sinebrychoff in 1998. Carlsberg then sold a 60% stake in Vingaarden to Finland's Oy Rettig (1999), sold its remaining 43% share of the Tivoli amusement park to Danish tobacco group Skandinavisk Tobakskompagni (2000), and reduced its 64% holding in Royal Scandinavia to 28% (2000). Carlsberg bought the beverage operations of Swedish firm Feldschlösschen Hürlimann in 2000 and agreed to combine brewing businesses with Norway-based Orkla in a deal worth $1.5 billion; Carlsberg Breweries was formed in February 2001 after both agreed to divest several brands and distribution rights to gain regulatory approval.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carlsberg stopped production at Coca-Cola Nordic Beverages (the company still exists but has no operations) in 2001 because of conflicts with Orkla's
   <company id="11166">
    Pepsi
   </company>
   bottling contracts in Sweden and Norway; Carlsberg and Coca-Cola continued to produce and sell Coke in Denmark and Finland. Nils S. Andersen became the company's president and CEO that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Carlsberg sold 32% of its Lithuanian brewery to Russia's Baltic Beverage Holding, a joint venture between Carlsberg and
   <company id="90370">
    Scottish &amp; Newcastle
   </company>
   . That year Carlsberg also signed an agreement giving Carib Brewery Ltd., part of the ANSA McAl Group, the rights to brew and distribute Carlsberg Beer in selected areas of the Caribbean.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Carlsberg Breweries acquired an additional 27.5% stake in Pirinsko Pivo, a Bulgarian brewery, bringing its overall ownership to 94.5%. That same year, it purchased the Chinese brewers Dali and Kunming. The following year the group acquired the Germany-based beer brewer and distributor
   <company id="91220">
    Holsten-Brauerei
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Nils Andersen left to become CEO at A.P. Møller - Mærsk; he was replaced by Jørgen Rasmussen.
  </p>
  <p>
   In November 2012 Carlsberg acquired all the outstanding shares of Russian brewer Pivovarennaya kompaniya Baltika.
