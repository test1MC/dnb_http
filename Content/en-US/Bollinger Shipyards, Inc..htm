  <p>
   Bollinger Shipyards was founded in 1946 by Donald Bollinger.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's marine construction and repair business, as well as its offshore supply vessel activities were seriously curtailed due the US federal government's moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, which went into affect in the spring of 2010 following the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Bollinger Shipyards was forced to downsize its company and lay off workers.
