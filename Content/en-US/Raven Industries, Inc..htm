   Quoth the Raven, "Balloons (and more) evermore!" Raven Industries is a diversified technology company that caters to the industrial, agricultural, energy, construction, military, and aerospace sectors. The company's Aerostar division sells high-altitude, research balloons, as well as parachutes and protective wear used by US agencies, while its Engineered Films Division makes reinforced plastic sheeting for various applications. The Applied Technology Division manufactures high-tech agricultural aids, from global positioning system (GPS)-based steering devices and chemical spray equipment to field computers.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The rugged sheeting made by the Engineered Films Division, 43% of sales, are applied for industrial, energy, construction, geomembrane, and agricultural uses. "Geomembrane" refers to containment liners used for environmental projects and water conservation. Products are marketed through independent distributors. Because the segment extrudes a large part of its products, it needs a significant amount of capital expenditures to stay operational. Extrusion is a process that includes pushing material through a circular or slot die.
  </p>
  <p>
   Besides GPS-based products and computers, the Applied Technology Division, also 36% of sales, markets a software platform called Slingshot that offers Real Time Kinematic (RTK) corrections of GPS signals for more accurate steering. Served by a globally based staff, the division markets its products to OEMs and through the aftermarket.
  </p>
  <p>
   Besides balloons, Aerostar, 21% of sales, also sells tethered aerostats, which are similar to blimps, used for surveillance and aerial communication. Besides parachutes and protective gear, the segment provides uniforms and also contracts to sew and seal products. Aerostar products are also marketed through competitive bids.
  </p>

  <p>
   Raven's revenues have decreased the last two years, dipping 4% from $395 million in 2014 to $378 million in 2015. Its profits also decreased 26% from $43 million to $32 million during that same time period mainly due to a spike in selling, general, and administrative expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The declines were fueled by a 55% decrease in South American sales and a 17% drop in Applied Technology Division sales during 2015. The division's decline was due to persistent weakness in the precision agriculture markets, both domestic and international, and an anticipated decline of contract manufacturing sales to non-strategic legacy customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Raven's operating cash flow has fluctuated over the years; after declining in 2014, it increased by 14% to $60 million due to favorable changes in inventories and increases in accounts receivable.
  </p>

  <p>
   Engineered Films touts its service in both extruding and converting films as a competitive advantage that provides more opportunity for customization to service its clients. One problem for Engineered Films is that no matter how well the economy may be operating, adverse weather can limit construction and the division's sales of plastic sheeting as a result. Construction and energy are the segment's largest markets. While it can't predict the weather, the company is optimistic about continued growth in oil and gas drilling that will increase demand for pit liners.
  </p>
  <p>
   Applied Technology has been innovating such improvements as Slingshot API, though it too is subject to the same vagaries of the weather that challenge its agricultural clientele. The company is optimistic about the health of the agricultural economy in the immediate future, however.

  <p>
   Raven's strategy for growth also includes acquisitions. In 2014 the company acquired Netherlands-based SBG Innovatie BV and its affiliate, Navtronics BVBA to broaden its guided steering system product line and launch Raven's European headquarters. SBG manufactures advanced GPS steering systems for a variety of agricultural applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year Raven picked up Integra Plastics, headquartered in Madison, South Dakota, for approximately $48 million. Integra specializes in the manufacture and conversion of high-quality plastic film and sheeting, and Raven made the deal in order to expand capacity and gain fabrication and converting expertise within its Engineered Films Division.
