  <p>
   GPHC's 2015 revenues decreased by 2% primarily due to the sale of its multi-wall bag and labels businesses in 2014, partially offset by additional revenue from acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income has fluctuated over the last several years. After decreasing in 2014, net income skyrocketed by over 150% to peak at $230 million in 2015. The net income growth was due to major decreases in restructuring and other special charges related to charges associated with business combinations and the closure of certain assets.

  <p>
   GPHC expands its operations through organic and acquisitive growth measures. The company is implementing strategies to expand market share in its current markets and to identify and penetrate new markets; to capitalize on its customer relationships, business competencies, mills and converting assets; to develop and market innovative, sustainable products and applications; and to continue to reduce costs by focusing on operational improvements.
  </p>
  <p>
   To adjust its operations following earlier large acquisitions, as well as due to economic challenges, GPHC has also streamlined its manufacturing operations. In 2015 the company closed its thermo mechanical paperboard mill in Jonquiere, Quebec. In 2014 it sold its multi-wall bag business to Mondi Group. The assets included almost 10 converting plants located throughout the US.

  <p>
   GPHC is focused on acquisitions to support growing its packaging business. In 2015 the company acquired Rose City Printing and Packaging, a converting company. the deal enhanced GPHC's footprint on the US West coast, further integrate its coated recycled board production out of the Santa Clara, California, mill and promote additional integration of the company's coated unbleached kraft products.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it also acquired the folding carton and paperboard mill assets of Cascades' Norampac Division. The Cascades' boxboard acquisition provides a vertically-integrated platform of both mills and folding carton converting facilities in Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   Growing in Europe, in 2014 it purchased Benson, a packaging company in the UK, for $191 million. Benson operated four folding carton facilities that converted approximately 80,000 tons of paperboard annually into folding cartons for the food, beverage, and health care products industries.

  <p>
   The company traces its roots to the formation of Brown Paper Company in 1923. That entity made sheet kraft paper and linerboard and changed names numerous times over the years and eventually became Riverwood International. Another predecessor, Coors Paper Packaging, was formed in the early 1970s, eventually becoming Graphic Packaging.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 privately held Riverwood Holding, owner of paperboard maker Riverwood International, bought rival Graphic Packaging International Corporation. Parent company Riverwood Holding changed its name to Graphic Packaging Corporation (GPC) and combined its operating units to form subsidiary Graphic Packaging International, Inc.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company took its latest form as Graphic Packaging Holding Company (GPHC) after the businesses of GPC and Altivity Packaging were merged in 2008, with GPHC emerging as the publicly-traded parent company. With this transaction, the company, which had been averaging about $2.5 billion in revenues, suddenly saw that number increase to more than $4 billion in 2008. The merger diversified Graphic Packaging's product lines, as well, through Altivity's coated-recycled boxboard operations, folding carton converting operations, and ink manufacturing, labeling, and flexible packaging facilities.
