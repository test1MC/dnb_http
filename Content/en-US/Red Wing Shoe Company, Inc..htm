   In an era where the term handmade has become more of a rarity, Red Wing Shoe Company is holding onto tradition by continuing to make its Red Wing-brand work shoes by hand, as it has since 1905. Its US and foreign factories make casual and outdoor shoes, as well as work and steel-toed boots. Its portfolio of brands includes such names as Red Wing, Vasque, Irish Setter, and WORX. Red Wing Shoe distributes its footwear through some 4,000 retail outlets in the US, as well as growing number of independently-owned Red Wing Shoe Stores in the US. Although it distributes worldwide, the US accounts for the bulk of its sales. The Sweasy family controls the company.

   The Minnesota company operates plants in Minnesota and Missouri. Its footwear is sold in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and South and Latin America.

   Red Wing, which sells its shoes through 4,000 US retail locations and 170 mobile shoe stores, targets both consumer and industrial customers.

   In addition to its manufacturing, distribution, and retail operations, Red Wing also owns a tanning plant, the S.B. Foot Tannery, and the St. James Hotel in Red Wing, Minnesota.

   The shoemaker has been busy building its branded retail network in recent years. Red Wing Shoe opened a North American operations headquarters in Houston to more easily serve its customers there with oil and gas personal protection equipment. The Houston location represents Red Wing Shoe's third global operations hub.
