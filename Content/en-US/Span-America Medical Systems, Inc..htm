   With its mattresses and cushioning products, Span-America Medical Systems offers more comfort to the sick and wounded than Grandma's chicken soup. The company's medical products division makes therapeutic mattresses and mattress overlays (under the Geo-Matt and PressureGuard brand names), as well as Span-Aid patient positioners (used to elevate and support body parts) and Isch-Dish pressure-relief seat cushions to aid wound healing. Span-America also markets skin care creams for wound management, and consumer bedding and industrial foam products. It sells its wares through sales staff and distributors to hospitals, home health care dealers, and extended-care facilities in the US and Canada.

  <p>
   The US is South Carolina-based Span-America's largest market, accounting for about 90% of annual sales. Canada and several other countries represent the rest.

  <p>
   Sales of medical products for wound management, such as foam mattress overlays, therapeutic support surfaces (which consist of non-powered and powered therapeutic support surfaces), patient positioners, seating products, and the Selan skin care product line, represent nearly two-thirds of Span-America's annual sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Consumer bedding and industrial foam products, aka the company's consumer product line, make up about 35% of Span-America's annual sales. The products, which consist primarily of mattress overlays and specially designed pillows are marketed by

   , the company's exclusive distributor.

  <p>
   Span-America's sales declined 3% in fiscal 2013 (ended September) versus the prior year, to $73.8 million. The medical products businesses posted a 2% sales gain on a 10% increase in revenue from the company's therapeutic support surfaces and a 3% jump in M.C. Healthcare sales. (The increase in M.C. Healthcare sales was primarily the result of having business for approximately two months longer in fiscal 2013 than in fiscal 2012.) Sales by the company's custom products division declined 11% year over year.
  </p>
  <p>
   On a geographic basis, sales in the US (the company's largest market) declined by nearly 3%, while Canada posted a 5% drop. The disappointing sales performance, coupled with rising marketing expenses and R&amp;D costs for the  M.C. Healthcare product lines resulted in a 3% decline in net income to $5.1 million. Cash flow from operations is up sharply over the past two years: from $3 million in fiscal 2011 to $8.2 million in 2013.

  <p>
   Despite the prominence of ts consumer bedding product line, a key long-term focus for the company is to become a leading maker and marketer of wound management products used in the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers (aka bedsores). To this end, Span-America is looking to develop or acquire new products in the field. Indeed, Span-America continues to introduce new items to bolster its product lines. It has seen good response to the introductions of the Risk Manager bedside safety mat and its Custom Care line of therapeutic support surfaces.

  <p>
   To increase its presence in Canada -- where the health care market is more stable -- in December 2011 Span-America acquired Ontario-based M.C. Healthcare Products, a manufacturer and supplier of medical bed frames and furniture for the North American long term care market, for about $9.8 million.
