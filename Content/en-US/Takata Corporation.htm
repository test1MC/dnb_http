   Takata, founded in 1933 as a textile maker, has since applied its knowledge of military parachute harnesses to develop safety products for passenger vehicles. It manufactures airbags as well as seat belts, steering wheels, child safety seats, and safety electronics, such as crash sensors. The company also produces interior parts -- head rests, arm rests, visors, and trim. Takata operates through 50-plus companies (R&amp;D, manufacturing, and sales) in 20 countries. The company sells to nearly all of the world's major automakers; about a third of its sales come from the US.

   Headquartered in Tokyo, it operates 56 plants in 20 countries such as Japan, China, the US, Mexico, Germany, Brazil, and Africa to name a few. The Takata group of companies operates globally, based on the four key regions of Japan, the Americas, Europe, and Asia.

   The company's revenues climbed 15% from 2014 to 2015. The growth for 2015 was driven by surges in the US (37%), China (13%), Japan (12%), and Germany (11%). However, the company posted a net loss in 2015 due to an increased cost of sales, warranty reserve losses, recall-related losses, and settlement payments.

  <p>
   In the years ahead, Takata expects growth in China, other Asian markets, and North American to offset a decline in vehicle production in Japan in the wake of a consumption tax increase and declining demand within key emerging markets such as Brazil and Russia.
