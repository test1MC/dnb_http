   <i>
    Playboy

   keeps printing articles, so someone must be reading them. Playboy Enterprises is an adult entertainment company anchored by its iconic, half-century-old periodical.
   <i>
    Playboy
   </i>
   , the #1 men's magazine with a circulation of about 1.5 million, features general-interest and lifestyle articles, interviews, fiction, and, of course, a monthly Playmate centerfold. In addition to publishing operations, Playboy runs
   <company id="138028">
    Playboy Entertainment
   </company>
   (cable and satellite channels under the Playboy and Spice banners), licenses its iconic logo, and operates
   <company id="99695">
    Playboy.com
   </company>
   . Founder Hugh Hefner took Playboy private in 2011 through his investment partnership Icon Acquisition Holdings.

  <p>
   Hugh Hefner, a former copywriter at
   <i>
    Esquire,
   </i>
   started
   <i>
    Playboy
   </i>
   magazine in 1953 with $6,000 in loans from friends, $600 of his own, and the money from some mortgaged belongings. The first issue was put together on Hefner's kitchen table and featured pictures of a young starlet named Norma Jean Baker (Marilyn Monroe) that were purchased for $500. The new magazine sold its entire run of 72,000 copies in two weeks, earning enough to publish a second issue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Circulation steadily climbed during the 1950s as
   <i>
    Playboy
   </i>
   tapped into, and helped shape, the lifestyle of young, urbane bachelors. More than a girly mag,
   <i>
    Playboy
   </i>
   endeavored to publish articles and fiction by such writers as John Updike and Jack Kerouac. The magazine's growing popularity in the face of Eisenhower-era conservatism was helped by Hefner's hip, swinger persona. In 1959 Hefner bought a 70-room home in North Chicago and dubbed it the Playboy Mansion. That same year he debuted
   <i>
    Playboy Penthouse
   </i>
   , a syndicated television show.
  </p>
  <p>
   Playboy's circulation reached 1 million copies in 1960. That same year the company opened its first Playboy Club in Chicago, a chain of members-only nightclubs that eventually expanded to 23 locations in the US. The magazine's rise was not without conflict and in 1963 Hefner was arrested on obscenity charges arising from a pictorial of actress Jane Mansfield. (He was later acquitted.) Undaunted, Hefner bought Chicago's Palmolive Building (renamed The Playboy Building; sold in 1989) in 1966 and returned to television with
   <i>
    Playboy After Dark
   </i>
   in 1969. The next year he bought a DC-9 and had it painted black. Dubbed The Big Bunny, Hef used it to shuttle between Chicago and the new Playboy Mansion in Beverly Hills, which was purchased in 1971. That same year the company went public.
  </p>
  <p>
   Magazine circulation reached its peak of more than 7 million in 1972, but living the high life began to take its toll on both the business and its leader. A drug scandal involving Hefner's personal secretary (who later committed suicide) in 1973 tarnished the magnate's image, and expansion into casinos and resorts led to increasing losses. The company sold Hefner's Big Bunny jet in 1976.
  </p>
  <p>
   With Playboy near bankruptcy, Hefner's daughter, Christie, took over as president in 1982 and immediately began closing and selling unprofitable businesses. Magazine sales suffered when some retail outlets stopped carrying the title due to the conservative political climate and broadcast-oriented adult fare began siphoning away readers. In response, the company launched a national pay-cable TV service and a home video business in 1982. Playboy later acquired the Collector's Choice music and video catalog business in 1987 and closed its last Playboy Club in 1988. That year Christie Hefner was appointed chairman and CEO. Her father, the world's most famous bachelor, married former Playmate Kimberly Conrad in 1989. (They divorced in 1998.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Playboy went online in 1994 with Playboy.com and formed its first overseas TV network the following year. Further expanding its TV offerings, Playboy acquired
   <company id="16983">
    Spice Entertainment
   </company>
   for $105 million in 1999. The company briefly rejoined the club scene that year with a new Playboy Casino in Rhodes, Greece, but sold its stake in the business the next year. The company also folded its international television operations into Playboy TV International (PTVI), a joint venture with
   <company id="52394">
    Cisneros Group
   </company>
   in which Playboy owned 20%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company filed to take
   <company id="99695">
    Playboy.com
   </company>
   public in 2000, but withdrew that registration later the same year. Plans to open a casino in the London area with
   <company id="42399">
    Ladbrokes
   </company>
   also fell through. Playboy won a Supreme Court decision that year when the high court struck down part of the 1996 Telecommunications Act that could have relegated the 24-hour Playboy Television network to nighttime-only broadcasting.
  </p>
  <p>
   After years of distancing itself from the more raunchy forms of adult entertainment, Playboy expanded into hard-core pornography through the purchase of three explicit sex channels from
   <company id="51033">
    Vivid Entertainment
   </company>
   and one of its sister firms in 2001. The company rebranded the channels under the Spice name. Late that year the company sold its music and video catalog unit to Chicago-based Infinity Resources and began launching international Web sites targeting Germany and Korea.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year Playboy brought in James Kaminsky, the former executive editor of
   <i>
    Maxim
   </i>
   (and cousin of celebrity Mel Brooks), to revamp the half-century old
   <em>
    Playboy
   </em>
   magazine. (According to Hefner, Kaminsky was later replaced due to "conflicts between staff members.") Also that year Playboy bought full control of 27 international channels from Cisneros affiliate
   <company id="103979">
    Claxson Interactive Group
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 the company published the 50th Anniversary issue of
   <em>
    Playboy
   </em>
   . The next year the company consolidated its online, television, and filmed entertainment operations into a new company,
   <company id="138028">
    Playboy Entertainment Group
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Playboy scored a major coup in 2006 when it acquired
   <company id="116485">
    Club Jenna
   </company>
   , the video production company run by popular starlet Jenna Jameson. The deal landed Playboy a popular star franchise and further expanded its reach into hardcore pornography. That same year the company opened a Playboy Club in Las Vegas through a partnership with the Palms Casino Resort, re-establishing the Playboy brand in the night club business it abandoned almost 20 years earlier. Hef also celebrated his 80th birthday in 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   Christie Hefner resigned from the family business in 2009. She was replaced by Scott Flanders, formerly CEO of newspaper publisher
   <company id="40942">
    Freedom Communications
   </company>
   . Founder Hugh Hefner remains editor-in-chief and chief creative officer. His Icon Acquisition Holdings took Playboy private in 2011.
