   Radius Health would like to banish the fear of Grandma falling and breaking a hip. The biopharmaceutical company targets osteoporosis and other women's health concerns through the development of new drugs. Its leading candidate is a synthetic version of a naturally occurring, human bone-building protein. Administered via injection or transdermal patch, the drug could be used to promote new bone growth and restore bone density in patients with osteoporosis. The company's pipeline also contains a treatment for hot flashes and one for age-related weigh loss, frailty, and muscle loss;

   , and Vetter Pharma make its drugs. Radius Health became a public company in mid-2015.

   Other strategic initiatives call for the commercialization of its lead candidate in the US and then Europe through cooperation with third parties.

  <p>
   The company has no revenue yet since none of its candidates have been approved for sale, and it's running at a $42.5 million loss mostly due to R&amp;D spending.
