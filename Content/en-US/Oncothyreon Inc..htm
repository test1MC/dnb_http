   Beating cancer is Cascadian Therapeutics' sole goal. Formerly named Oncothyreon, the biotechnology company is developing synthetic vaccines and small-molecule (chemical) drugs that aim to battle the dread disease. Cascadian's vaccine candidates stimulate cancer-fighting elements in patients' immune systems. Lead candidate Stimuvax is a potential vaccine for non-small cell lung cancer that the company has licensed to Germany's
   <company id="58089">
    Merck KGaA
   </company>
   . Its traditional drug candidates work to inhibit certain cancer-specific proteins; candidates being developed include potential treatments for pancreatic and metastatic cancer.

  <p>
   Its clinical-state candidates include ONT-380, an HER2 inhibitor; and ONT-10, a vaccine targeting MUC1. ONT-380 is being developed for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The company has an exclusive license agreement with

    Array BioPharma
   </company>
   to develop, manufacture, and commercialize ONT-380. Meanwhile, Cascadian has developed the synthetic vaccine adjuvant PET-Lipid A and Tecemotide, an antigen-specific immunotherapy.

  <p>
   The company has not yet generated revenues as of fiscal 2014. Its net loss increased by 29% to $50 million that year, primarily due to an increase in R&amp;D expenses as well as an increase in license fees paid to Array and higher expenses related to its October 2014 acquisition of Alpine Biosciences.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow increased 33% to $48 million that year on changes in accounts and other receivables, current assets accrued, and other liabilities.

  <p>
   The company acquired Alpine Biosciences in 2014, gaining nanoparticle platform technology designed to enable the targeted delivery of multiple therapeutic agents including nucleic acids and proteins. It intends to use the acquired protocell technology to develop additional drug candidates for the treatment of cancer (by itself or with partners).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company began a collaboration with Sentinel Oncology in the UK to develop novel small molecule Chk1 kinase inhibitors; it also began partnering with Adimab for the discovery of novel antibodies against immunotherapy targets. Additionally, it entered a co-development agreement with Celldex Therapeutics to partner on a combined phase 1 trial of ONT-10 and varlilumab.
