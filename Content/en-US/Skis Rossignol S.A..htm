   Skis Rossignol likes it when things go downhill. Or at least when its skis and snowboards do. The company's alpine, freeski, and Nordic ski brands include Rossignol, Dynastar, Lange, and Look. Its snowboards and skis are worn for recreation and competition and used as rental equipment at ski resorts. Rossignol also makes ski boots, bindings, poles, hats, and gloves. Its wares are sold by sporting goods retailers, ski shops, and specialty stores worldwide. Rossignol skis have been worn by many Olympians and world champions since the 1930s. The company is a subsidiary of Swedish private equity house Altor Equity Partners.

  <p>
   In the early 1900s Abel Rossignol operated a turnery in Voiron, France, that produced wooden spools and other articles used by the textile industry. Rossignol became enthusiastic about the new sport of skiing, and in 1907 he introduced the first commercially made French skis. The skis earned acclaim, and Rossignol spent the next thirty years making skis and sleds, as well as items for the textile industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Olympic athletes, including gold medal-winning French skier Emile Allais, began using Rossignol skis in the 1930s, and by 1951 Rossignol's company was selling several thousand pairs a year, mostly on the strength of its technical advances. Rossignol sold his company to French businessman and ski-lift owner Laurent Boix-Vives in 1956. Boix-Vives, who bought the company for $50,000, quickly cut the company's struggling textile operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Boix-Vives grew the company from a small ski producer to a multinational company. The firm introduced its first metal skis in 1960 and fiberglass skis in 1968. In 1967 the company bought ski manufacturer Dynastar. By 1972, when the company incorporated as Skis Rossignol, it had the best-selling skis on the market. In 1973 Skis Rossignol established a US subsidiary and manufactured skis in Vermont until 1984. The popularity of skiing, especially in the US, exploded during this time and Skis Rossignol took advantage of it with investments in research and development. During this time winning Olympians continued to sport its skis.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1970s Skis Rossignol continued to produce innovative skis, experimenting with laminates and composite construction. It also established a cross-country division in 1976 and the next year, after weak winters and plummeting sales, introduced tennis rackets. As the poor snowfall in Europe hurt sales again in the late 1980s, the company continued to diversify. In 1989 Skis Rossignol purchased boot maker Lange. The next year it picked up Roger Cleveland Golf Company. The company purchased two ski bindings companies, Look and Geze, in 1994, adding the only ski components it didn't already produce.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the mid-1990s Skis Rossignol was selling about 2 million pairs of skis a year and had 30% of the world market. However, since 80% of sales came from outside France, it was hurt by fluctuations in the value of the franc.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company restructured in 1998, consolidating production and ending its research and development efforts for in-line skates. The plant restructuring included outfitting its Spanish factory to be the world's largest producer of snowboards. To fill the facility, in 1999 Skis Rossignol bought French snowboard bindings company Emery, then in 2000 it acquired snowboard company Grand Chavin, maker of the Hot, Hammer, and A Snowboard brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 the company ceased using the A Snowboard brand name, and in 2005, the company was bought by sports apparel titan Quiksilver. The new owner sold Rossignol's Roger Cleveland Golf segment in 2007 for $132 million to SRI Sports Limited.
  </p>
  <p>
   Near bankruptcy, Rossignol was sold to Chartreuse &amp; Mont Blanc in 2008 for about $145 million by
   <company id="14526">
    Quiksilver
   </company>
   . When the deal was completed, the snowsports brand underwent a major restructuring that lasted through the end of 2009. Its turnaround included about a 30% workforce reduction, and its product selection was cut in half to focus more on Rossignol's core ski offerings. Its textile and apparel business was also contracted out
