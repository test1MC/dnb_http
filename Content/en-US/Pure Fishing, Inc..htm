        <p>
   Pure Fishing's sales force is divided by geographic region: Canada, Europe, Latin America, the Pacific Rim, and the US. Looking to serve the spectrum of beginner outdoorsmen to extreme outdoor enthusiasts, the company leverages the use of promotions and PR campaigns.

        <p>
   Pure Fishing operates as part of Jarden's Outdoor Solutions segment alongside Coleman. The segment focuses on the global consumer active lifestyle market and contributes about 40% of Jarden's revenue, up from just about 25% several years ago.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   While Jarden does not break out separate financials for Pure Fishing, sales in the Outdoor Solutions segment increased 1% in fiscal 2013 as compared to 2012, driven by a 3% boost in net sales on a currency-neutral basis, as well as increases across its camping and outdoor, fishing, technical apparel, and winter sports businesses. Indeed, parent Jarden logged sales rises during the reporting period in certain international markets, specifically Asia, offset in part by unfavorable foreign currency translation.

   Jarden, which bought Pure Fishing in 2007 for more than $300 million in cash, had been looking for an acquisition that would extend its reach into more niches of the recreational industry and bring with it a portfolio of recognized brand names. Pure Fishing has benefited from brand growth and a deeper pool of capital resources for expansion.
