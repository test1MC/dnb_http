   Speed enthusiast Edelbrock makes performance-enhancing parts for race cars and motorcycles, recreational and passenger vehicles, light trucks, and watercraft. The short list includes carburetors, intake manifolds, cylinder heads, water pumps, air cleaners, camshafts, exhaust systems, an array of other aftermarket parts, and even some branded sportswear. Specifically for
   <company id="10706">
    Harley-Davidson
   </company>
   motorcycles, Edelbrock tailors a line of aftermarket engine parts. The company markets its products mainly through automotive chain stores, online dealers, mail-order houses, and warehouse distributors. The Edelbrock family -- led by company chairman, president, and CEO Vic Edelbrock Jr. -- runs the company.

   Depsite a luckluster economy, Americans continue their love affair with fast cars. Edelbrock has long capitalized on an exclusive agreement with
   <company id="46898">
    NASCAR
   </company>
   to supply replacement manifolds. Its prefered status has helped it to gain market share with auto enthusiasts. The company also sponsors the National Hot Rod Association.
  </p>
        <p>
   As opposed to drivers needing to repair their car, Edelbrock's mainstream customers are willing to invest discretionary dollars for parts to rebuild engines and super-charge their ride. For this market segment, the company churns out new replacement products for models -- like the Pontiac brand that
   <company id="10640">
    GM
   </company>
   cut from its family -- still on the road.
  </p>
        <p>
   Moreover, the company's focus on product research and development, supported by its metalcasting and machining operations, has enabled the parts maker to preserve its elite brand. In early 2011 Edelbrock rolled out a series of performance aluminum cylinder heads, designed for the uniquely configured classic.

   In 2012 the company acquired SX Performance, an affiliate of Essex Industries, Inc. and a long time supplier of all Edelbrock electric Quiet-Flo fuel pumps, in-line fuel pumps, and regulators. The acquisition helps Edelbrock to reduce production lead times and become more price competitive.

   With his brother-in-law, Victor Edelbrock Sr. opened his first auto repair shop in Beverly Hills, California, in 1933. In 1938 Edelbrock founded a manufacturing company that specialized in crafting parts to make cars go faster. A hot-rodder himself, Edelbrock began winning races with cars using manifolds and cylinder heads he designed. He soon drew the attention of other racers as his business revved into high gear. In 1946 he began selling parts through his own catalog. Edelbrock expanded its product line during the 1950s.
  </p>
        <p>
   Victor Edelbrock Sr. died in 1962, and his son Victor Jr. took over the business. He steered the company to even higher sales in the 1960s and early 1970s. During the early 1980s the company began to diversify, adding parts that included carburetors and camshafts. Edelbrock continued to expand its product line in the 1990s, and it became vertically integrated in 1991 by opening its own aluminum foundry. Cashing in on its brand recognition among auto enthusiasts, Edelbrock added new markets, with a focus on building its presence in retail chains.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1994 the company went public and moved into motorcycle parts. It began producing cylinder heads for Harley-Davidson and added carburetors and air cleaners in the next year. Edelbrock suffered a setback in 1997 when its second-largest customer, Super Shops, declared bankruptcy. In 1998 Edelbrock built a distribution facility in Torrance, California. The company signed a deal in 1999 to provide cylinder heads, water pumps, and intake manifolds to cars used in the Richard Petty Driving Experience.
  </p>

   In 2000 Edelbrock formed an agreement with JG Engine and Automotive Systems Group to offer performance products for import vehicles. Early the next year it acquired the performance products line of Russell Industries.

   Citing that its shares were undervalued, Victor Edelbrock Sr. took the company private in late 2004 for $57.2 million. The decision, however, placed a debt load that Edelbrock soon looked to lighten. Chicago-based private equity Industrial Opportunity Partners in mid-2010 provided a cash-infusion, but allowed the Edelbrock family to hold a substantial stake. The undisclosed investment is anticipated to position the company to benefit from the gradual, slow recovery.
