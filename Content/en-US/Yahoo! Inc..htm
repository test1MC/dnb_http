   Yahoo! wants to spread some cheer to Internet users around the world. Its network of websites offers news, entertainment, and shopping, as well as search results powered by
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   's Bing. Yahoo! generates most of its revenue through providing search and display advertising to Web operations in three categories: Communications &amp; Communities (including Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! Groups, and
   <company id="136786">
    Flickr
   </company>
   ), Search and Marketplaces (Yahoo! Search), and Media (Yahoo! Homepage, Yahoo! Finance). Other revenues come from fee-based services such as premium e-mail; royalties, licenses, and mobile products; and broadband Internet access. Yahoo! agreed sell its core internet business to
   <company id="10197">
    Verizon
   </company>
   for about $4.48 billion.
  </p>

  <p>
   After the deal with Verizon was announced, Yahoo! revealed several hacking episodes that exposed personal information of millions of its users. Verizon reduced its offer for Yahoo! by $350 million down to $4.48 billion. The companies also agreed to share certain legal and financial liabilities stemming from the hacking incidents. The transaction was to close in the second quarter of 2017.
  </p>

  <p>
   Yahoo! received about 42% of its revenues from search services in 2015, which it provides through an arrangement with Microsoft. The company is halfway through the 10-year partnership with the software giant. As part of the agreement, Microsoft's Bing search engine is the search provider on Yahoo!'s websites. In addition, Yahoo! handles sales of search ads for both companies, and the two firms share search revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is focused on informing, connecting, and entertaining its users with its search (Yahoo Search), communications (including Yahoo Mail and Yahoo Messenger), and digital content products (including
   <company id="162565">
    Tumblr
   </company>
   , and its 4 core verticals: Yahoo News, Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance, and Yahoo Lifestyle).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Business outside the Americas accounts for 22% of revenue, but much of the company's total value comes from its Asian assets, worth around $17 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company continues to manage its business geographically. The Americas contributed 80% of the total revenue in 2015; Asia Pacific (13%); and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), 7%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yahoo! owns a majority or 100% of all of its international operations (except in Australia, New Zealand, and Japan where the company has joint ventures and/or non-controlling interests). The company supports these businesses through a network of offices worldwide. In international markets, the company either has its own internal sales professionals or relies on its established sales agency relationships in 35 countries.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company maintains three primary channels for selling its advertising services: field, mid-market, and reseller/small business. Its field advertising sales team sells display advertising in all markets and search advertising services in non-transitioned markets to leading advertisers and agencies. Its field advertising team also sells search advertising to premium advertisers in transitioned markets. Its mid-market channel sells services to medium-sized businesses, while its  reseller/small business channel enables it to sell advertising services to additional regional and small business advertisers. In 2013 Yahoo! reorganized its US sales force.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yahoo! spent $184 million in 2015 on advertising, up from $142 million and $128 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's net revenue had been decreasing since 2012, followed by 8% growth in 2015. In 2015, Yahoo!'s net revenue increased by 8% to $4.97 billion due to an increase in the Americas segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Americas revenue grew thanks to increases in search and display revenue driven by mobile devices as well as $390 million attributable to the Mozilla Agreement. Americas display revenue also grew thanks to an increase in video and native advertising, including incremental revenue following the BrightRoll acquisition and higher revenue from mobile devices driven by native advertising.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Yahoo! posted a net loss of $4.36 billion (compared to net income of $7.52 billion in fiscal 2014), mainly due to increase in goodwill impairment charge, related to the US and Canada, Europe, Tumblr, and Latin America reporting units, and changes in other income (expense), related to changes in the estimated fair value of the Hortonworks warrants (recorded in the previous year as a gain upon Hortonworks' IPO and a gain related to the mark-to-market of the warrants).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company posted an operating cash outflow of $2.38 billion (compared to operating cash inflow of $0.92 billion in fiscal 2014), mainly due to net loss and changes in working capital (which included the reduction of the income tax liability related to the sale of
   <company id="162238">
    Alibaba
   </company>
   shares in 2014) and earnings in equity interests.

  <p>
   Yahoo! is in the midst of a campaign to re-establish its relevancy in the face of fierce competition. A pioneer in Web search and navigation, Yahoo!'s collection of content and services made it an early leader in the Internet world, but Internet giant
   <company id="59101">
    Google
   </company>
   has since eclipsed Yahoo!, having gained nearly 65% of the US search market. (By comparison, Yahoo! has some 15% of global traffic.) In addition, Yahoo! faces competition from younger social network stars
   <company id="148344">
    Facebook
   </company>
   and
   <company id="160756">
    Twitter
   </company>
   , which have become the dominant services for online communication and information sharing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's strategic plan includes improving user and advertiser product quality and growing daily active users, driving continued growth in revenue realized through its Mavens (mobile, video, native and social) and explore asset divestitures. In this context, in 2016 Yahoo! agreed sell its core internet business to
   <company id="10197">
    Verizon
   </company>
   for about $4.8 billion. However, the deal was put in peril when it was revealed that at least 500 million Yahoo user accounts had been stolen by a hacker in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   (In 2015 Yahoo! had considered spinning off its remaining stake in Alibaba to create a new company which would have included some Yahoo! businesses such as its Internet access business as well as the shares of Alibaba).
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2016 Yahoo! announced plans to cut 15% of its workforce (about 1,700 jobs) amid a restructuring to narrow its focus.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015, the company acquired Polyvore, Inc., (a social commerce website that lets users across the globe discover and shop for their favorite products in fashion, beauty and home d√©cor) for $161 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the company completed the acquisition of Flurry, Inc., (a mobile data analytics company that optimizes mobile experiences for developers, marketers, and users) for $270 million. The combined scale of Yahoo and Flurry created more personalized app experiences for users and enabled more effective mobile advertising solutions for brands seeking to reach their audiences and gain cross-device insights.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among its 2014 moves was Yahoo!'s acquisition of BrightRoll, a programmatic video advertising platform in the US. The acquisition makes Yahoo! the largest video advertising platform in the US.

  <p>
   David Filo and Jerry Yang began developing the Yahoo! search engine and directory while students at
   <company id="40442">
    Stanford
   </company>
   in 1994. By the end of that year, their website was attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors. The next year they incorporated the business and tapped former Motorola (now
   <company id="11023">
    Motorola Solutions
   </company>
   ) executive Timothy Koogle as president. Revenue also began flowing in 1995 when Yahoo! started selling ad space on its website. The company went public the next year and share prices soared. Yahoo! teamed with
   <company id="42482">
    SOFTBANK
   </company>
   and its affiliates to form
   <company id="138125">
    Yahoo! Japan
   </company>
   and
   <company id="136201">
    Yahoo! Europe
   </company>
   in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Yahoo! created Internet navigation service Netscape Guide by Yahoo! for
   <company id="42472">
    Netscape Communications
   </company>
   (now part of
   <company id="102518">
    America Online
   </company>
   ). The company also acquired Internet directory specialist Four11 and launched Yahoo! Korea. The company's growth continued in 1998 with acquisitions of Viaweb (e-commerce software), WebCal (Internet scheduling products), and
   <company id="56018">
    Yoyodyne
   </company>
   (Internet direct marketing). With competition between Netscape and Yahoo! heating up, the two companies agreed to pull the plug on the Netscape Guide by Yahoo! service.
  </p>
  <p>
   Branching into audio, the company launched its Yahoo! Radio broadcast Internet radio service in 1999. It also teamed with
   <company id="52106">
    TIBCO Software
   </company>
   to offer Corporate My Yahoo!, the company's foray into corporate intranets. Yahoo's $3.7 billion acquisition of
   <company id="54008">
    GeoCities
   </company>
   and the more than $5 billion purchase of
   <company id="52156">
    broadcast.com
   </company>
   in 1999 stoked the Internet consolidation trend. Its purchase of software maker Encompass that year enhanced its Internet software holdings. Yahoo! also signed a deal with
   <company id="103483">
    Sprint
   </company>
   to provide information to Sprint's cell phone customers. Koogle was also named chairman in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the course of the 21st century (so far), Yahoo! lost its early lead in search to Google as it tried to be more of a media company than a technology company. After going through a string of CEOs, the company hired Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive to lead the company. (Mayer stepped down as CEO in 2016).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Yahoo! agreed to pay $1.1 billion for the
   <company id="162565">
    Tumblr
   </company>
   blogging site with more than 100 million users. Yahoo! is using the deal to fill a social networking hole and to avoid getting left behind as people's online habits change. Among other 2013 acquisitions, Yahoo! also acquired mobile app maker Qwiki. Qwiki allows users to create videos in Apple's iPhone. The company paid about $50 million for Qwiki.
