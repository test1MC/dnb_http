   Like the scientist for which it is named, Faraday Printed Circuits has a longstanding fascination with electricity. The company manufactures various sorts of printed circuit boards (PCBs), which are essential components within many types of electrical and electronic equipment. Vendors of electronic goods outsource production of PCBs to Faraday to lower costs and improve quality. It handles production volumes ranging from one-off prototypes, for which it promises a turn around of 24 hours, to high-volume quantities requiring about two weeks. Faraday specializes in multi-layer, plated through hole, single- and double-sided, and flexible circuits. The company was established in 1987.

   Faraday's Front End Engineering Department conducts Design Rule Checks (DRC) to ensure PCB layouts meet its manufacturing capabilities. The company also does customer-approved Design For Manufacture (DFM) editing to make sure that designs align with its production processes for the best yields.

   Faraday operates a 22,300-square-foot manufacturing facility at its headquarters in Washington, UK. For large quantities, it turns to PCB manufacturers in Asia.
