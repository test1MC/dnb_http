   Group Lotus is in the pole position to offer a broad range of sports cars. From the race-car inspired Exige to the Elise series, the company's Lotus Cars division is sure to satisfy enthusiasts' need for speed. Its Elise model is a mid-engined, rear-wheel drive, convertible sports car, while its Exige S vehicle has a 345 horsepower supercharged V6 engine. The Lotus Evora 400 is its flagship award-winning, high performance supercar. In addition, the company's Lotus Engineering division consults with other carmakers worldwide to take a project from concept to design, development, and testing.

  <p>
   For a balanced diversification of its revenue stream, Lotus depends upon several regions around the globe. With about 2,000 orders for its cars in total each year, the majority of these come from customers in Asia, followed by Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and finally, the Americas.

   Extending its reach into Asia, Lotus launched its fastest ever convertible in Malaysia in 2014 -- the Exige S Roadster. Also that year, the company opened its first 4S center in Beijing, China. The facility sits on a foot-print of approximately 1,000 sq. meters over 4 floors at the Golden Port Motor Park in Beijing.
