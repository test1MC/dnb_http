   Arla Foods UK doesn't milk the cows but once that job is done, they take it from there. Processing some 3.2 billion liters of fresh milk a year, it is one of the UK's leading dairy brands. Arla's products include milk, butter, cheese, yogurt, and cream. The company's distribution unit collects the raw milk, and delivers processed milk and milk products to supermarkets where it is sold under brand names Lurpak, Cravendale and Lactofree, as well as under private-labels. The company also sells bulk dairy ingredients to food manufacturers. It is a subsidiary of Danish

  <p>
   Arla Foods UK can trace its roots to Express Dairy, a London-area dairy formed in 1864. Diversified food and spirits firm Grand Metropolitan bought Express Dairy in 1969. In 1992 Express Dairy was bought by Northern Foods, originally an importer of condensed milk based in Northern England that expanded by acquiring local dairies before moving into foods such as baked goods.
