   Sage Manufacturing is wise in the ways of fly fishing. The company designs and hand builds angling equipment and accessories for the fishing enthusiast, continually innovating its lineup of fly rods, reels, and lines for "maximum fishability." Sage has developed such lines as the Z-Axis fast-action rods, as well as niche models like the BASS and ZXL. The manufacturer sells its products through a network of dealers across the US and also through online retailers, such as American Fly Fishing Company and Anglers Pro Shop. The company was known as Winslow Rod Company when it was founded by rod designer Don Green in 1980. Today it is owned by Seattle-based diversified holding company Joshua Green Corporation.
