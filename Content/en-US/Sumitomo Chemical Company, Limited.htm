   Sumitomo Chemical makes chemicals for almost everything made and grown under the sun. About one-third of the company's sales come from petrochemicals and plastics, such as polypropylene, ethylene, and elastomers. Sumitomo's other major units make pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals (insecticides, herbicides, and fertilizers), and basic chemicals, such as caustic soda and methanol. The firm also makes chemicals for electronics and fine chemicals. Part of Japan's

  <p>
   The story of Sumitomo Chemical begins in 1590 with the Sumitomo family's founding of a copper refinery in Japan. For three hundred years generations of the family nurtured the copper business. Early in the 20th century noxious sulfur dioxide emissions at the company's Nihama copper smelter began to endanger the local population. To halt the pollution, the company built a plant in 1913 to convert the sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid and calcium superphosphate, products Sumitomo used to make fertilizer. In 1925 the chemical plant at the Nihama smelter was spun off as an independent company and renamed Sumitomo Fertilizer Manufacturing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company broadened its product line in the 1930s by adding ammonia-related chemicals (also used to make fertilizer) to its production. In 1934 the company changed its name to Sumitomo Chemical.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWII Sumitomo Chemical grew rapidly as it provided chemicals for military use. The company absorbed Japan Dyestuff Manufacturing (dyes and pharmaceuticals) in 1944. When the war ended in 1945, nearly half of Sumitomo Chemical's plants lay in ruins. Even battered, the company managed to enter the postwar period as Japan's largest chemical company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following the war, the Allied occupation authority forced Sumitomo Chemical to separate from Sumitomo and change its name to Nisshin Chemical Industries. Nisshin Chemical bought Sumitomo Aluminum Reduction, another former affiliate of the Sumitomo group, in 1949.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Korean War created a need for chemicals in the region and led to the relaxation of restrictive commercial laws. In 1952 Nisshin Chemical changed its name back to Sumitomo Chemical and once again affiliated with Sumitomo. Continuing to build its product line, the company constructed one of Japan's first petrochemical plants in 1958. Sumitomo Chemical's second petrochemical complex was built near Tokyo in 1965.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's metals division grew to a point that in 1976 Sumitomo Chemical converted it into an independent subsidiary called Sumitomo Aluminum Smelting. Market conditions began to deteriorate, and Sumitomo Chemical failed to respond adequately. As a result,
   <company id="52314">
    Mitsubishi Chemical
   </company>
   soon surpassed Sumitomo Chemical as Japan's largest chemical producer.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's response was to consolidate its petrochemical operations during the 1980s and to form a partnership with the Singaporean government to operate a nationalized chemical complex. Sumitomo Chemical merged its pharmaceutical businesses with those of Inabata &amp; Company in 1984 and spun off those operations as Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals. Also during this time, the company expanded into North America and moved its aluminum smelting operations out of Japan (1986).
  </p>
  <p>
   A prolonged recession in Japan during the 1990s and monetary crises in Asian countries led to decreases in demand and prices for the company's products. These forces contributed to Sumitomo Chemical's increased emphasis on globalization. In 1997 the company expanded its petrochemical complex in Singapore, and the next year it formed chemical subsidiaries in Australia and China. Continuing its overseas expansion in 1999, Sumitomo Chemical formed Philagro South Africa (agricultural chemicals and hygiene products).

  <p>
   The company added US-based

   ' agricultural products business in 2000. In March 2003, the company called off a planned merger with
   <company id="101812">
    Mitsui Chemicals
   </company>
   , Japan's #4 chemical maker at the time, after more than two years of negotiations. The combined company would have been Japan's largest.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005, Sumitomo formed a joint venture called SUMATION with
   <company id="118663">
    Cambridge Display Technology
   </company>
   to develop and supply advanced polymer materials called polymer-organic light emitting diodes, which are used to deliver fine resolution for televisions and in lighting applications. Two years later the company acquired Cambridge Display, taking full ownership of the JV in the process, for $285 million. It also acquired
   <company id="10471">
    Dow Chemical
   </company>
   's LUMATION light-emitting polymers business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the company swooped in to take advantage of Australian agrochemical company
   <company id="123904">
    Nufarm
   </company>
   's uncertainty regarding a proposed offer to buy that company from Chinese giant Sinochem. When Sinochem revised its bid lower, Sumitomo Chemical stepped in to take a 20% stake in Nufarm (completed in 2010). Also in 2009, subsidiary Dainippon Sumitomo acquired US pharmaceutical firm
   <company id="11673">
    Sunovion
   </company>
   (the former Sepracor), which holds a patent to the insomnia drug Lunesta.
  </p>
  <p>
   The pharmaceuticals unit was formed through the 2005 merger of the company's pharma operations with Dainippon Pharmaceuticals. Sumitomo Chemical still owns just more than half of the company, whose products include medications for cardiovascular disease and gastrointestinal disorders, as well as anti-allergy pharmaceuticals.
