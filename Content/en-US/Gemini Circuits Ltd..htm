Vendors of electronic goods turn to UK-based G-Tec to take on manufacturing chores more cheaply than they could do themselves. The company also offers services such as product assembly and test, prototyping, artwork scanning, and design layout. Owner and managing director David Harsant founded Gemini Circuits in 1974.
