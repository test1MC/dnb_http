   Airbus Group (formerly European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company, or EADS) is busy in the commercial and military aerospace and related markets. Considered Europe's largest supplier, it rivals
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   in the competitive skies. The company's largest segment is
   <company id="40566">
    Airbus

   Airbus Group has three operating Divisions:
   <company id="40566">
    Airbus
   </company>
   , Airbus Defence and Space, and
   <company id="109738">
    Airbus Helicopters
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Airbus is one of the world's leading aircraft manufacturers, offering the most modern and efficient passenger aircraft on the more than 100-seat market. The Airbus commercial product line comprises aircraft that range in size from the 107-seat single-aisle A318 aircraft to the 525-seat A380 widebody aircraft.
  </p>
  <p>
   Airbus Helicopters (formerly Eurocopter) is a global leader in the civil and military rotorcraft market. Its product range includes light single-engine, light twin-engine, medium and medium-heavy rotorcraft, which are adaptable to all kinds of mission types based on customer needs. With more than 3,000 operators in more 150 countries, Airbus Helicopters supports some 12,000 in-service rotorcraft.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the defense and space businesses of Airbus Military, Astrium and Cassidian were combined into the new Airbus Defence and Space. This segment is Europe's number one defense and space enterprise, and the world's second largest space business. Its core businesses are  Space, Military Aircraft, Missiles and related systems and services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other businesses include turboprop manufacturer ATR, aerostructure and aircraft seat business Sogerma.

  <p>
   Airbus Group's revenues have risen consistently since 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 net sales increased by 5% due to higher Airbus and Airbus Helicopters segment sales, partially offset by decreased sales from Airbus Defence and Space.
  </p>
  <p>
   Airbus' revenues increased by 7% driven by the overall increase in deliveries to a more favorable delivery mix including 30 A380s (compared to only 25 in 2013); Airbus Helicopters sales increased thanks to government programs including the ramp-up in NH90 activity. By contrast, Airbus Defence and Space's revenue decrease was driven by lower deliveries of military aircraft and fewer Ariane 5 launches.
  </p>
  <p>
   Airbus Group's net income has followed similar a trend that of its revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 net income increased by 58% due to higher sales, lower selling expenses and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased research and development expenses. Selling and administrative expenses decreased by 6% in 2014. Research and development expenses increased by 9% reflecting R&amp;D activities at Airbus. The main contribution to the expenses comes from the A350 XWB program.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net cash provided by the operating activities increased by 35%.
  </p>

  <p>
   Airbus Group is seeking to dominate  the commercial aeronautics, military aircraft and space markets by driving innovation, globalization, services, and value-chain optimization. As part of this strategy, in 2014 the company pooled its scattered defense activities into a new unit, Airbus Defence and Space.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Airbus launched its global aerospace business accelerator where start-ups and Airbus 'intrapreneurs' (internal entrepreneurs) can work together to speed up the transformation of their innovative ideas into valuable businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year ATR and TAP M&amp;E signed a dual partnership. On one hand, TAP M&amp;E joined the network of centers recommended by ATR for the maintenance of the airframes of its aircraft; on the other hand, the aircraft manufacturer has also chosen TAP M&amp;E as first spare parts repair center in Brazil, for support of its maintenance contracts offered to ATR operators.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the joint venture Airbus Safran Launchers was created after the approval of the development and production of a new Ariane 6 launcher at the ESA Ministerial Conference.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has also sold a number of assets as part of its streamlining process and to pay down debt. In 2014, Airbus Defence and Space sold its Test &amp; Services activities to a consortium consisting of ACE Management S.A., and IRDI S.A., for  €31 million.  That year it also sold its 26.8% share in
   <company id="139708">
    Patria Oyj
   </company>
   to the Finnish defence, security, and aviation services provider for €133 million. It also sold
   <company id="90718">
    Dassault Aviation
   </company>
   shares for €794 million.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2014 Airbus Operations S.L.U., Getafe (Spain) acquired a additional 58.49% shares in Alestis Aerospace S.L., La Rinconada (Spain) for €28 million, including €6 million due to the separate recognition of settlements of preexisting relationships.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Airbus Group acquired Salzburg München Bank AG from Raiffeisenverband Salzburg, allowing the aeronautics and space group to establish a company bank in order to provide additional financing options. All parts of Airbus Group should benefit from the increased financing flexibility that this bank will provide.

  <p>
   The growth of the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company -- EADS -- is overshadowed by the long history of its components and by the obstacles overcome to cement the deal: The French and the Germans historically aren't overly fond of each other, so how did it come to pass that Germany's
   <company id="91103">
    DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG
   </company>
   (DASA) and France's
   <company id="90781">
    Aerospatiale Matra
   </company>
   put aside their differences to band together with Spain's Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA)?
  </p>
  <p>
   The US aerospace sector in the 1990s saw many companies consolidate, scrambling to make their way in the post-Cold War era. Boeing, the largest aerospace company in the world, got that way by acquiring a number of operations, including Rockwell International's aerospace and defense operations (1995), and most importantly,
   <company id="10975">
    McDonnell Douglas
   </company>
   in a $16 billion deal (1997). In the same era, defense giant
   <company id="10903">
    Lockheed
   </company>
   merged with
   <company id="54397">
    Martin Marietta
   </company>
   (1995) and acquired
   <company id="10915">
    Loral
   </company>
   (1997). These US companies had it relatively easy -- they all paid taxes to Uncle Sam, but acquisition deals in Europe were stymied by concerns over national security and privatization because much of Europe's defense industry was government-owned.
  </p>
  <p>
   Spurred into action by their US rivals, DASA and British Aerospace (now
   <company id="40681">
    BAE SYSTEMS
   </company>
   ) -- partners in Airbus -- began merger talks in 1997. Fearful of being left out in the cold, France's government-owned Aerospatiale -- another Airbus partner -- began talks to merge with Matra, a French defense company controlled by Lagardère. Weeks after the Aerospatiale-Matra deal was announced in 1998, the chairman of DASA's parent company, Jürgen Schrempp, met with Lagardère's CEO, Jean-Luc Lagardère, and proposed a three-way deal. It never occurred and in 1999 the BAE SYSTEMS and DASA deal fell through, as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later that year Schrempp and Lagardère met again and laid the groundwork for a merger between DASA and Aerospatiale Matra. Less than three weeks after the Aerospatiale-Matra merger was completed, Lagardère found itself pitching the DASA/Aerospatiale Matra merger idea to a stunned French government (which still held a 48% stake in Aerospatiale Matra). Marathon negotiations ensued. Late in the year Spain's Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA) agreed to become part of EADS.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 EADS went public and Airbus announced that it would abandon its consortium structure in favor of incorporation. The next year EADS began pushing for a consolidation of army and naval equipment manufacturing among EU countries similar to the aerospace consolidation that created EADS. For Airbus, the long-sought switch from consortium to corporation finally occurred in July 2001 when Airbus S.A.S. was incorporated.
  </p>
  <p>
   EADS bought out BAE SYSTEMS' 25% share in their Astrium joint venture in 2003. In October 2004 EADS agreed to acquire US defense electronics maker Racal Instruments as part of its plan to increase defense sales in the US. Rumors surfaced the next month that EADS was discussing a merger deal with French defense company
   <company id="90847">
    Thales
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In December 2004 EADS and BAE SYSTEMS gave Airbus the green-light to build the superjumbo, twin-deck A380, a plane that competes directly with Boeing's upcoming 787 Dreamliner. A few months later in early 2005, EADS was given preferred bidder status for the UK's Royal Air Force aerial refueling tanker contract. The program was valued at approximately $25 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Claiming victory at last in 2006, Airbus beat Boeing on deliveries (434 vs. 398), but Boeing racked up a record 1,004 plane orders, while Airbus notched only 790. Moreover EADS' shares took a pounding in 2006 on Airbus' announcement that deliveries of the A380 would be delayed by six or seven months due to manufacturing glitches. A group of EADS shareholders cried foul and filed suit when it was revealed that co-CEO Noël Forgeard and five other EADS directors exercised stock options weeks before an internal investigation into the delays was launched. Two weeks later Forgeard fell on his sword and resigned. Louis Gallois, former chairman of
   <company id="90808">
    Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Français
   </company>
   (SNCF), France's state railway company, was named to replace him. The same fate befell Airbus boss Gustav Humbert, who was replaced by Christian Streiff, a former executive at French building materials concern,
   <company id="40729">
    Compagnie de Saint-G
   </company>
   obain.
  </p>
  <p>
   The production logjams at Airbus also prompted some of the company's airline customers to seek compensation in lieu of taking their business elsewhere (Boeing). EADS forecast that the production delays at Airbus would be a $2.5 billion drain on profits over four years. In the wake of the additional delivery delays, Airbus CEO Christian Streiff was sent packing after only three months on the job. EADS Co-CEO Louis Gallois was named as his replacement.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Daimler announced plans to gradually reduce its stake in EADS from about 30% to half that amount. Later that year EADS acquired Sofrelog of France (a maker of maritime monitoring systems). Russian bank Vneshtorgbank (100% controlled by the Russian government) also purchased a 5% stake in EADS for about $1.17 billion. The stake did not entitle Vneshtorgbank to a board seat, but the move was expected to strengthen cooperation between EADS and the re-emerging Russian aerospace industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   After long negotiations, EADS shifted in 2007 to a new management structure aimed at cutting down on the damaging political bickering between its German and French management and shareholder factions. Politicians like German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy touted the compromise as a success. Others, namely labor forces, were more skeptical -- calling the latest management shake-up just another round of musical chairs that leaves the power struggles between Paris and Munich largely unresolved.
  </p>
  <p>
   EADS continued to expand into emerging markets, especially regions including Asia, the Middle East, and North and South America. Deliveries included the company's (long-delayed) A380 model, launched with
   <company id="41497">
    Singapore Airlines
   </company>
   in late 2008. Adding to Airbus's standing, the all-new A350-XWB (made for the most part of lighter-weight composite materials) sliced into about two-thirds of jet demand in the Middle East. It also forged alliances and won contracts in Brazil, China, Japan, and North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Airbus launched a cost-cutting initiative in 2008 that slashed some 10,000 jobs. Dubbed Power8, the plan marched out cost-saving measures that aimed to reduce development cycles by two years and boost overall productivity by 20%. Central to Power8 was the spinoff of some of Airbus's manufacturing facilities to new partners. Partner funding of planes like the A350-XWB (spurred by assurances of subcontract work) plus plant sales risked an ongoing row between Airbus and unions, as well as factory owners -- stakeholders who feared plant divestitures and more job cuts. That year EADS captured its first big US military contract when Airbus North America was given the opportunity to make
   <company id="150344">
    US Army
   </company>
   light utility helicopters.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was awarded a contract to replace outdated KC-135 refueling tankers, in conjunction with
   <company id="11093">
    Northrop Grumman
   </company>
   , for the
   <company id="150260">
    US Air Force
   </company>
   -- an upset protested by rival bidder
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   . Soon after, the
   <company id="151300">
    Government Accountability Office
   </company>
   (GAO) announced its findings of  flaws in the bidding process. EADS and Northrop Grumman dropped out of the bidding in early 2010, with EADS vowing not to submit a proposal unless it was assured that it had a fair chance to win. By late summer -- after US president Obama assured French president Nicolas Sarkozy that the Pentagon tanker bidding process would be fair -- EADS announced that it would consider once again to enter into the bidding war. The contract to build the US tanker, valued at approximately $35 billion, went to Boeing in early 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   In September 2012 EADS (now the Airbus Group) announced it was considering a merger with UK-based BAE Systems, a global provider of sensors, flight controls, and aircraft. However, the proposed $45 billion merger -- which would have created the largest global aerospace and defense player on the planet, both in total sales and market value -- was called off weeks later after it failed to pass European governmental and regulatory hurdles.
  </p>
  <p>
   Preparing to capitalize on demand, Airbus Group hammered out its Vision 2020 goals, under which it pursues the world's #1 position in air and space platforms, systems, and services. Services are targeted to achieve a 25% share of the business in less than 10 years. To this end, Airbus Group has been scouting deals in the services sector. In August 2011 it agreed to purchase Vizada, a global satellite-based mobile communication services provider, from French private-equity Apax France. The whopping €673 million ($969 million) deal bolsters Airbus Group's subsidiary Astrium, a top contractor of space-technology wares in Europe, and furthers opportunities beyond Europe with maritime, aerospace, as well as land, media, and other commercial customers. Hard on its heels, Airbus Group took over more than 98% of Canada-based Vector Aerospace for C$625 million (about $341 million). Vector joins Eurocopter as a standalone business, adding a multi-platform aviation repair and overhaul business.
