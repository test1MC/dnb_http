   This company hopes its products will help customers take a longer walk through the Garden of Life. It manufactures and supplies nutritional supplements, specialty food items, and personal care products. Its supplements include weight management, digestive health, and immune-system support products. The company's Original Medicine division produces nutritional products for distribution by health practitioners; its other lines are sold through natural foods retailers. Many of Garden of Life's products are based on a program called The Maker's Diet which was created by company founder and chairman Jordan Rubin in 2000 after overcoming Crohn's disease. Garden of Life has agreed to be acquired by
