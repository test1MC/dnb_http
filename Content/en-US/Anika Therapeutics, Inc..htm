   Anika Therapeutics uses hyaluronic acid (HA), a natural polymer extracted from rooster combs and other sources, to make more than 20 products that treat bone, cartilage, and soft tissue. Anika's Orthovisc treats osteoarthritis of the knee and other joints and is available in the US and overseas. (

    DePuy Mitek
   </company>
   sells the product in the US.) The company also makes and sells products that maintain eye shape and protect tissue during eye surgery. Other items include surgical anti-adhesive products, veterinary osteoarthritis therapies, and dermatology products. The US accounts for about four-fifths of sales.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Orthobiologics products make up about 85% of the company's annual revenues. In addition to Orthovisc, Anika markets osteoarthritis drugs in international markets: Orthovisc mini (for treatment in small joints); Monovisc, a next-generation, single-injection therapy; and Cingal, an HA formulation plus steroid. Anika received Canadian approval for Monovisc in 2009 and

    FDA

   approval for Monovisc in 2014. It received Canadian approval for Cingal in 2015, followed by European approval for the product in 2016. It has additional osteoarthritis and joint health treatments under development.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is seeking FDA approval for Cingal and Hyalofast, a biodegradable support for bone marrow stem cells used in cartilage regeneration.

  <p>
   Headquartered in Massachusetts, Anika has an international office in Italy. The US accounts for more than 80% of revenue, followed by Europe, which accounts for about 10% of revenue.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company uses a contract sales organization to market Cingal in the US, but it ultimately hopes to bring those functions in-house.
  </p>
  <p>
   While Anika markets some products on its own, a number are sold through additional partnering firms and distribution representatives.
   <company id="139097">
    DePuy Mitek
   </company>
   is Anika's largest customer, accounting for 72% of product sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dermal products are sold through a network of distributors in Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East; surgical products are sold through a similar network in Europe, the Middle East, and in certain Asian markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Anika also has partnerships to distribute products with such firms as

   ,
   <company id="91087">
    Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica

   , and

    Medline Industries

   .

  <p>
   Anika has seen strong revenue growth over the past several years, including a 41% jump to $105.6 million in 2014. However, revenue declined 12% to $93 million in 2015 in the absence of certain milestone payments (despite growth of sales that year).
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has also risen and, like revenue, dropped in 2015. It fell 20% to $31 million that year due to the lower revenue and an increase in R&amp;D costs. Cash flow from operations slipped 2% to $39 million over the same period.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company's growth efforts stem from adding new products, adding new indications for existing products, and expanding its geographic reach. Its orthobiologics products are seeing the fastest growth, now accounting for some 85% of sales. Additionally, Anika seeks more partnerships with others to commercialize its products. In 2016, the company gained European approval for Cingal as a medical device to treat knee pain.
  </p>
  <p>
   R&amp;D spending is largely dedicated to developing products for tissue protection, repair, and regeneration. In 2015, R&amp;D spend totaled $9 million, up from $8.1 million in 2014 and $7.1 million in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   Anika is taking on the manufacturing of its HYAFF (HA-based) products, which have been made by an Italian third party. By doing so, it can bring additional products to the markets more quickly.
