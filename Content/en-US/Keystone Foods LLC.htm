It processes some 200,000 birds/day, about half of Keystone's needs in the country.

   To grow in the US market Keystone is focusing on diversifying its client portfolio in the food service segment. In Asia and the Middle East, the company's growth strategy is focused on forging partnerships and joint ventures to drive growth in key markets, such as China and Indonesia. At the global level, Keystone is also focusing its efforts on growing and diversifying its presence in the beef market by improving its supply chain through greater integration with sister company Marfrig Beef. Another area of focus in 2014 is the poultry business, with plans to expand processing capacity in the US and Asia.

   The Asian market and fast-food giant

   are both important to Keystone Foods. Indeed, McDonald's accounts for approximately 70% of Keystone's business in the US. Beyond the Golden Arches, Keystone is growing its business with other clients, such as
