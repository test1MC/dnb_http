   To clarify, the Gulf Stream is a powerful current that runs up the Atlantic coast of the US, but Gulf Stream Coach makes powerful motor homes that similarly run up and down highways to vacation spots across the US. Gulf Stream sells almost 30 brands and more than 100 models of recreational vehicles. Its luxury Class A motor homes are divided between tour masters, diesel pushers, front-engine diesels (FRED), gas, and toy haulers. Operating through the Conquest Motorhomes division, Class C models are pedaled. In addition, Gulf Stream makes towable recreational vehicles (travel trailers and fifth wheels). The company operates as a subsidiary of manufactured home builder
