   HNI Corporation specializes in making office furniture, including seating, storage, modular workspaces, and desks. Its products are sold under brands such as
   <company id="126092">
    HON
   </company>
   , Allsteel, Gunlocke, Maxon, Paoli, and Sagus (among others) to furniture dealers, wholesalers, and office product distributors, as well as retailers such as
   <company id="14308">
    Office Depot
   </company>
   and
   <company id="14790">
    Staples
   </company>
   . Office furniture generates 77% of sales; the remainder is driven through HNI's
   <company id="110863">
    Hearth &amp; Home Technologies
   </company>
   . The unit, one of the largest US makers of fireplaces for the home, operates under the Fireside Hearth &amp; Home banner. Founded in 1944, HNI has distribution partners in 50-plus countries, but most of its products are sold in North America.

  <p>
   The furniture systems and hearth provider operates through two reportable segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Office Products segment, which accounts for 77% of its revenue, is responsible for designing, manufacturing, and marketing office furniture systems and seating across a diverse range of price points. Its products portfolio includes panel-based and freestanding furniture systems and complementary products, including storage, seating, and tables.
  </p>
  <p>
   HNI's Hearth Products segment, bringing in 23% of sales, comprises gas, electric, and wood-burning fireplaces, inserts, stoves, facings, and accessories. To its benefit, its Heatilator and Heat &amp; Glo brands are leaders among the two largest segments of the home fireplace market: vented-gas and wood fireplaces. Through its Hearth segment, HNI is also the leader in both pellet-burning stoves and furnaces, thanks to its Quadra-Fire, Harman Stove, and PelPro product lines. The products offer home heating options using renewable fuel.
  </p>
  <p>
   Product-wise, the company makes more than 50% of its total revenue on systems and storage furniture, while more than 20% comes from seating furniture sales. Another more than 20% comes from its hearth product sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Iowa-based HNI operates its business worldwide through offices, manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, and sales showrooms located in the US, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and India.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company makes office furniture in the US (Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, New York, North Carolina, and Texas), China, and India. Hearth products are manufactured in Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Washington.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's five largest customers generated 22% of HNI's consolidated net sales in fiscal 2016 (ended January).
  </p>
  <p>
   HNI sells its products through an extensive network of independent office furniture dealers, office products dealers, wholesalers, retailers, and federal, state and local governments. It supplies its office furniture to the largest distributors of office products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company peddles its office furniture products through five principal distribution channels. It makes export sales through HNI International to office furniture dealers and wholesale distributors serving select foreign markets. Distributors are principally located in Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Middle East. Through both its Lamex and BP Ergo businesses, HNI makes and distributes office furniture directly to end-users and through independent dealers and distributors in greater China, Asia, and India. HNI International focuses on selling office furniture products made by HNI operating units in select markets outside of the US and Canada.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   HNI has enjoyed several years of revenue and profit growth, thanks in large part to its fast-growing hearth products business.
  </p>
  <p>
   HNI rang up a record-high $2.3 billion in sales in fiscal 2016, an increase of 3.7% over the prior fiscal year. The rise in sales was driven by the Hearth Products division, which posted a 13% year-over-year gain, mostly thanks to higher prices and higher incremental sales. Hearth Products revenues also jumped by 9%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income increased by a steep 72% in fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher net sales, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, particularly selling, general and administrative expenses. SG&amp;A expenses rose by 3.6%, driven by higher freight costs, strategic investments, and acquisition costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash generated from operating activities in fiscal 2016 totaled $173.4 million, compared to $167.8 million generated in fiscal 2015.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   A leading maker of office furniture and hearth products in North America, HNI aims to build on its reputation and market share while also pursing growth opportunities in global markets. Its growth strategy involves rolling out new products, building brand equity, focusing on the end-user, strengthening its distribution network, responding to global competition, pursuing complementary strategic acquisitions, entering new markets, and keeping an eye on costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company works to develop products that are relevant, differentiated, and focused on quality, aesthetics, style, sustainable design, and on reducing manufacturing costs. To this end, HNI has focused on improving existing products, extending product lines, leveraging ergonomic research, fine-tuning its manufacturing processes, applying alternative materials, and providing engineering support and training to its operating units. It conducts its product development efforts at both the corporate and operating unit level. Indeed, HNI invested about $31.1 million in product development in fiscal 2015, up from the $$29.7 million and $27.3 million it spent during the prior two fiscal years, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of HNI's ongoing business simplification and cost reduction strategies, the company exited a small line of business within itshearth products segment during fiscal 2016. During 2014, HNI closed three office furniture manufacturing facilities in Alabama, Illinois and India and consolidated production into other office furniture manufacturing facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   HNI has also seen success in pursuing complementary acquisitions in recent years.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In October 2014, amid rising sales for Hearth Products, HNI's Hearth &amp; Home Technologies business acquired rival Vermont Castings Group (VCG), a maker of free-standing hearth stoves and fireplaces with annual sales of about $100 million.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Friends Maxwell Stanley, Clement Hanson, and Wood Miller founded The Home-O-Nize Co. (a name that suggested "modernize" and "economize") in 1944, planning to make home freezers and steel kitchen cabinets. These two products were never made, however, because of a steel shortage.
  </p>
  <p>
   The first Home-O-Nize product was an aluminum hood used in the installation of natural gas systems. More important than the aluminum hood was the aluminum scrap left behind, which the company made into beverage coasters. These coasters, which could be imprinted with a company's name, were sold to businesses to give out as gifts. Home-O-Nize also transformed the aluminum scraps into boxes for file cards and, due to favorable response, decided to plunge into the office products business.
  </p>
  <p>
   This move began in earnest in 1951, in an effort dramatically labeled "Operation Independence Home-O-Nize." The program was successful, and in 1952 the company started an unbroken string of profitable years. Helping this streak were such products as Unifile, a file cabinet that featured a single key that would lock all drawers simultaneously (1953). Home-O-Nize added cabinets, coat racks, and desks to its product line during this time and began marking all its products with the "H-O-N" label. Miller retired in 1958.
  </p>
  <p>
   Home-O-Nize grew during the 1960s under the control of Stanley Howe, a Home-O-Nize employee since 1948. Howe had been appointed president in 1964 and made the company a national manufacturer by purchasing a plant in Georgia in 1967. The firm changed its name to HON INDUSTRIES the next year. Hanson left the company in 1969.
  </p>
  <p>
   HON INDUSTRIES continued its expansion by purchasing California-based Holga Metal Products in 1971. Acquiring facilities in Pennsylvania and the opening of a plant in Virginia the next year gave HON INDUSTRIES a considerable presence on both US coasts. Howe replaced founder Maxwell Stanley as CEO in 1979.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1981 HON INDUSTRIES moved into the fireplace market by acquiring Heatilator, a leading brand of prefabricated fireplaces. By 1987, four decades after shipping its first product, HON INDUSTRIES had become a
   <em>
    FORTUNE
   </em>
   500 company that many regarded as the most efficient in the making of office furniture. (It could produce a desk a minute and a chair every 20 seconds.) HON INDUSTRIES acquired Gunlocke, a maker of wooden office furniture, in 1989.
  </p>
  <p>
   The rise of the office products superstore at the start of the 1990s did not go unnoticed by the company, which quickly positioned itself as a supplier to these businesses. Yet no action could spare HON INDUSTRIES from the office supply bust that occurred soon afterward, as oversupply and a lagging national economy dragged the industry downward.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jack Michaels became the new CEO in 1991 as the company's sales dropped for the first time in decades. It adapted by investing in new products, and by 1992 sales were climbing again. In 1996 HON INDUSTRIES acquired rival fireplace maker Heat-N-Glo, which it merged with Heatilator to form Hearth Technologies. The next year it acquired three furniture makers, including Allsteel, and further bolstered Hearth by buying stove maker Aladdin Steel Products in 1998. HON INDUSTRIES closed three plants in 1999 to cut costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired hearth products distributors American Fireplace Company and the Allied Group in 2000, and wood case goods manufacturer Paoli (2004).
  </p>
  <p>
   HON INDUSTRIES has been recognized repeatedly for its excellence; it was twice named as one of the "400 Best Big Companies in America" by
   <i>
    Forbes
   </i>
   magazine (2000, 2001) and was honored as the most admired company in the furniture industry by
   <i>
    FORTUNE
   </i>
   magazine (2003).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 the company changed its name to HNI in an attempt to reduce confusion between itself (HON INDUSTRIES Inc.) and its largest subsidiary (The HON Company). Its 2004 purchases included Paoli (wood case goods and seating, from
   <company id="47447">
    Klaussner Furniture
   </company>
   ), Edward George (fireplace and stone products), and Omni Remanufacturing (panel systems).
  </p>
  <p>
   Stan Askren, from

   ,
   <company id="126092">
    The HON Company
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="10514">
    Emerson Electric
   </company>
   , replaced Michaels as the firm's top executive in 2004. Askren had been appointed president in 2003. The company sought Askren for his expertise in human resources, operations, and marketing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2006 the company acquired Lamex, a Chinese office furniture manufacturer. Other acquisitions in 2006 included an office furniture services company, an office furniture dealer, and a manufacturer of fireplace facings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since 2007 the company has sold a corporate airplane and office furniture manufacturing centers in Virginia and Mexico.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 it acquired Hickory Business Furniture (HBF) from
   <company id="10768">
    Furniture Brands International
   </company>
   for about $75 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In October 2014, HNI's Hearth &amp; Home Technologies business acquired rival Vermont Castings Group, a maker of free-standing hearth stoves and fireplaces with annual sales of about $100 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   HNI acquired
   <company id="123597">
    Sagus International
   </company>
   , a designer and maker of furniture for schools, for $56 million in 2011. With annual sales of more than $90 million, Sagus' educational furniture is marketed through ArtcoBell (K-12 furniture), Midwest Folding Products (cafeteria and folding tables), and LSI Corp. of America (laminate caseworks furniture for the education and health care markets). The investment in Sagus was part of HNI's strategy to introduce products from adjacent markets to stabilize uncertain demand for office furniture.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012, looking to one of the fastest growing office furniture markets in the world, HNI purchased India's BP Ergo Ltd., a leading manufacturer and marketer of office furniture there.
