  <p>
   Benjamin Moore and his brother Robert started selling paint in Brooklyn in 1883. They reaped rewards as chemical advances made rapid improvements in paint quality and durability. The company expanded in the US and north into Canada. It focused on the high-end niche of the industry, setting a premium price for its top-quality paints. The company slogan was "quality, start to finish."
  </p>
  <p>
   The arrival of latex paint in the mid-1940s introduced a product that was environmentally friendly, easier to apply and clean up, and durable. In the midst of the post-war boom, the company founded its Technical Coatings Co. in 1948 to make primers, topcoats, and packaging coatings. In the 1960s Benjamin Moore began its Temporary Co-Ownership program, which provided minority entrepreneurs with about $200,000 in start-up capital to open paint stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   Benjamin Moore introduced its computerized color analysis system in the 1980s and put together a financing plan to make it affordable for its dealers. The company began advertising more aggressively in the early 1990s, and in 1994 it formed a joint venture with Southern Cross Paints, a New Zealand company. In 1997 the company teamed up with Crayola to produce 150 designer paints in Crayola's crayon colors. In 1999 the company purchased Janovic Plaza, one of New York City's largest independent paint retailers. It also sold its Australian subsidiary, White Knight Paints Pty Ltd.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Benjamin Moore began restructuring its operations; to that end, it reduced its manufacturing facilities from 16 to 8 and cut 300 jobs (about 10% of its workforce). Later in the year the company was acquired by Warren Buffett's

   in a $1 billion cash deal. Early in 2002 the company sold its flexible packaging adhesives business to

   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008, though, the company bought
   <company id="105409">
    Insl-X Products
   </company>
   , which makes a range of decorative coatings products. That same year,  Benjamin Moore closed its Coronado Paint operation in Edgewater, Florida, idling 108 workers. Production at the Edgewater plant was moved to a Benjamin Moore facility in Pell City, Alabama.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Benjamin Moore teamed with Constellation Energy to install a solar power system in its 80,000 sq. ft. product development facility in Flanders, New Jersey. The system, which contains some 8,600 crystalline photovoltaic solar panels, is expected to produce 68% of the facility's energy needs over the next 20 years and offset the release of 1,600 tons carbon dioxide each year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012, Natura, a zero-Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) paint, received the Green Good Housekeeping Seal, acknowledging its high degree of sustainability plus rigorously tested performance. Other products in Benjamin Moore's Green Promise® portfolio are Aura®, a low-VOC paint, and EcoSpec®WB, a zero-VOC paint for commercial interiors.
