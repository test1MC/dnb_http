   The locals at the pub know a good thing when they drink it -- such as a pint of Bulmers Original cider or maybe a Dutch-brewed "Heinie." Heineken UK's brews include Foster's, John Smiths, Strongbow, and Kronenbourg 1664. As a subsidiary of the Netherlands-based

   , the company also imports and distributes Heineken and Amstel beers. In addition to these frothy brews, Heineken UK sells Jacques sparkling cider and McEwan's ale and Newcastle Brown Ale. The company's Scottish &amp; Newcastle Pub Company operates about 1,000 leased pubs throughout the UK.

   The company has eight sites in the UK. It has breweries, cider plants and offices in Edinburgh, Livingston, Tadcaster, Manchester, London, Hereford and Ledbury.

   Aiming to boost productivity and efficiency, the company has consolidated its Scottish &amp; Newcastle Pub business with its other on-trade operations in the UK. As part of the move, Heineken UK reduced its workforce by about 50 jobs. The integration was completed in early 2011.

   To further invest in its core beer market, the company in 2010 sold its UK drinks distribution unit WaverleyTBS to private investment firm Manfield Partners. (The WaverleyTBS subsidiary United Wine Merchants, operating in Northern Ireland, was not included in the sale and remained part of Heineken UK.)
