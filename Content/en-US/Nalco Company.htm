   The company sells its wares in more than 160 countries worldwide. Nalco has targeted emerging geographical markets for growth, looking toward the BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, and China -- like every other respectable global giant, but also to areas like West Africa, the Middle East, and the region surrounding the Caspian Sea.

   Nalco provides specializes in industrial water, energy, and air applications, offering energy services (for refinery and petrochemical processing plants) as well and services for the control of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, mercury, and particulates for natural gas, petroleum, and petrochemical industries.

   In 2012 Nalco installed it 20,000th 3D TRASAR technology system (boiling, cooling, and membrane technology) which helps customers to conserve water. Since the first installation in 2004, 3D TRASAR systems have helped customers save an 438 billion gallons of water (the annual water needs of more than 17 million people).

   In 2011 Nalco sold its NALFLEET marine chemicals unit to Norway-based
   <company id="150004">
    Wilhelmsen Ships Service

   for $41 million. That year Nalco sold its Performance Products Group to
   <company id="10921">
    Lubrizol

   for $166 million. The company divested the two units in order to focus on its core industrial water and process treatment businesses.

        <p>
   Nalco Chemicals got its start because, as its chief chemist would say, "You can put water in your stomach that you dare not put in a boiler." In the early 1920s Herbert Kern founded Chicago Chemical Company, and Wilson Evans started Aluminate Sales Corporation. Both companies sold liquid sodium aluminate, which is used to soften water -- Chicago Chemical for water used in industrial boilers, and Aluminate Sales for steam locomotives. In 1928 Chicago Chemical, Aluminate Sales, and Alcoa's sodium aluminate unit merged to form National Aluminate Corporation.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1930 the company acquired Paige-Jones Chemical Company of New York, and with it the capability to supply its water-treatment products in the form of "ball briquettes." During the 1930s it began making gel-type water-softening agents at the urging of one of its chemists, Emmett Culligan. (Culligan left to start his own
   <company id="43677">
    water-treatment firm
   </company>
   in 1935.)
  </p>
        <p>
   During WWII, Chicago Chemical was revived for a three-year stint making catalytic products for aviation fuel. At war's end, it again became a division of National Aluminate, bringing expertise in petroleum cracking and ion exchange materials. In 1947 National Aluminate went public. The postwar era brought a major challenge as railroads converted from steam to diesel locomotives; the changeover cost the company half its business in just a few years. In response, the company developed diesel catalysts and additives, cooling system treatments, and weed-control chemicals for the railroads. In the 1950s National Aluminate expanded into Europe and Latin America and added new customers such as papermakers and nuclear power plant operators. The company changed its name to Nalco Chemical Company in 1959.

   In 1962 Nalco and UK-based
   <company id="41791">
    Imperial Chemical Industries
   </company>
   (ICI) formed Catoleum Pty. Ltd. in Australia. Later in the decade the company established Nalfloc in the UK and Katalco in the US (sold to joint venture partner ICI in 1986).
  </p>
        <p>
   Nalco set up regional water-analysis laboratories throughout the US during the 1970s and continued overseas expansion. The company established itself as a star during a decade of dismal US stock performance. Nalco continued to acquire in the 1980s and moved into new markets such as chemicals for the electronics and auto industries. By 1989 Nalco's sales topped $1 billion.
  </p>
        <p>
   To combat the recession of the early 1990s, Nalco sold some operations, increased its sales force, and continued to innovate, creating a process to detoxify crude oil sludge. Nalco's 1996 acquisitions included Molson Companies' water-treatment operations and UK-based chemicals firm Albright &amp; Wilson. It soaked up the Netherlands-based International Water Consultants Beheer BV and the assets of Nutmeg Technologies in 1997. Nalco added more water-treatment companies in 1998, including Trident Chemicals, Dutch company USF Houseman Waterbehandling, and three Malaysian firms.
  </p>
        <p>
   Nalco bought more water-treatment companies in Brazil, Finland, Italy, Sweden, the UK, and the US in 1999. That year French utility
   <company id="90853">
    Suez
   </company>
   bought Nalco for $4.1 billion in cash. In 2000 Suez tapped Nalco to integrate and control the operations of Calgon, Aquazur, and other group water-treatment companies.
  </p>
        <p>
   Early in 2001 Suez added the Ondeo name to all of its water operations to build brand identity; Nalco Chemical became Ondeo Nalco. (Ondeo was derived from the word "water" in several languages.) The company also purchased
   <company id="107126">
    GEO Specialty Chemicals
   </company>
   ' paper chemical business later in 2001.
  </p>
        <p>
   Suez sold Nalco to a group of private equity firms -- the
   <company id="43093">
    Blackstone Group
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="40036">
    Apollo Management
   </company>
   , and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners -- in 2003 for more than $4 billion. The acquiring group dropped the Ondeo from the company's name and hired former
   <company id="10721">
    Hercules
   </company>
   CEO William Joyce to take over as chairman and CEO. Until a secondary offering of shares in mid-2005 the consortium's ownership stake still had been well above the 50% mark. Joyce retired in 2008 and was replaced by J. Erik Fyrwald, who had been president of

        <p>
   Its Nalco Mobotec unit provides services to fight air pollution. Nalco Mobotec announced in 2009 a joint venture with
   <company id="114034">
    Sonic Technology Solutions
   </company>
   that will develop processes to use fly ash from coal-fired power stations as an ingredient in the manufacture of a cement substitute or concrete additives.
  </p>
        <p>
   Nalco expanded its water pre-treatment services and related specialty equipment capabilities when it acquired Res-Kem Corporation and General Water Services of Philadelphia in 2010. The move improved Nalco's ability to provide customers in the northeastern US with industrial water equipment, supplies, and accessories. It also acquired Fabrication Technologies, a company that designs, fabricates, and installs complex injection and fluid treatment facilities used in oil recovery. Renamed Nalco Fab-Tech, the acquisition offers services to oil and gas companies that use, treat, and recycle produced water.
  </p>
        <p>
   Also that year Nalco's Russian subsidiary formed a joint venture with a subsidiary of Russia's largest oil company,
   <company id="52426">
    LUKOIL
   </company>
   , to provide energy chemicals and services in western Siberia.
