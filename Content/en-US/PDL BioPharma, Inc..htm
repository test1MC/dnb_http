   If your body starts fighting you, PDL BioPharma hopes to help you fight back. The company's antibody (protein) humanization technology makes it possible to alter mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) for use in human therapies, such as preventing and treating autoimmune diseases and cancer. The firm has licensed its technology to such companies as
   <company id="10628">
    Genentech
   </company>
   (a
   <company id="41787">
    Roche
   </company>
   subsidiary),
   <company id="13209">
    Biogen
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="53783">
    Chugai Pharmaceutical
   </company>
   . PDL derives nearly all of its revenues from royalties on products including Genentech's cancer medications Herceptin and Avastin and Biogen's multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   PDL currently receives royalties on the sales of humanized antibody products including Avastin, Herceptin, Kadcycla, Lucentis, Perjeta, and Xolair from Genentech; Tysabri from Biogen; Gazyva from Roche, Entyvio from
   <company id="56037">
    Takeda
   </company>
   , and Actemra from Chugai. Royalty and licensing income from Genentech accounted for more than 70% of PDL's annual revenues in 2014, with income from Biogen accounting for 10% and
   <company id="53505">
    Depomed
   </company>
   another 7%.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The US accounted for 58% of PDL's revenue in 2014; Europe accounted for 42%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company leases some 48,000 sq. ft. of office space in Incline Village, Nevada.

  <p>
   PDL has experienced climbing revenues over the last decade as sales of its licensed products have increased. Revenues rose by 31% to some $581 million in 2014 on higher sales of Avastin, Herceptin, Xolair, Perjeta, Kadcycla, Tysabri, Actembra by licensees. A higher fixed royalty rate (versus 2013's blended fixed and tiered rate), an increase in the fair value of the acquired royalty rights from PCL's purchase of Depomed's diabetes-related royalties, and higher interest earnings all contributed to the higher revenues that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has also risen over the past few years. In 2014 it rose 22% to $322 million due to the higher revenue. This was partially offset by rising interest and income tax expenses. Cash flow from operations grew 8% to $292 million that year.

  <p>
   The company is primarily focused on acquiring income-generating commercial-stage therapies and devices with strong economic fundamentals and intellectual property protection. The clock is ticking on PDL's patents to its humanized antibody products, and the company is also busily looking to license its technology and antibodies to other biotech companies. PDL is also looking to invest in development-stage programs that could product future royalties. Among the companies it has recently invested in are Direct Flow Medical and Paradigm Spine.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2014 the company entered into a settlement agreement with Genentech and Roche; the settlement resolved all outstanding legal disputes between the companies. It precludes Genentech and Roche from challenging PDL's Queen patents and from contesting their obligation to pay royalties.

  <p>
   PDL shifted from a research and development company with commercial products of its own to become a strictly development-stage business. It sold its commercial assets in 2008, including oncology drug IV Busulfex, cardiovascular drugs Cardene and Retavase, and its antibody manufacturing plant. PDL then spun off its biotech development operations into a new publicly traded company to separate them from its profitable royalty business. (The spinoff,
   <company id="160684">
    Facet Biotech
   </company>
   , was later snapped up by
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Laboratories
   </company>
   ). PDL retained rights to all current and future licensed antibody revenues.

  <p>
   In 2014, PDL acquired a portion of royalty payments of the U-M's royalty interest in Cerdelga for $65.5 million. The company will receive 75% of all royalty payments due under the license agreement with
   <company id="13560">

   until patents expire.
