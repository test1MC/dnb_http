   The company is working to expand its product offerings in core therapeutic areas and new fields of medicine. Each year, the company launches one or two new product enhancements. In 2014 Biodex expanded its shielding and storage product line by introducing the Clear-Lead Mobile Radiation Barrier and the Tabletop Shield. It also added the Balance System SD to its Fall Risk Screening Program. These products follow the company's 2013 rollout of a new Atomlab thyroid uptake system, which has enhanced versatility for nuclear medicine applications, and its new line of Ultrasound Table for sonographers. In 2012 it also launched a new series of surgical c-arm tables and an improved version of its semi-recumbent elliptical cross-training machine (BioStep 2).
