   Catalyst Pharmaceutical, a development-stage biopharmaceutical firm, is developing treatments for rare neurological diseases such as Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and infantile spasms. Its amifampridine phosphate, named Firdapse, is under development for LEMS but also being tested for the treatment of other neuromuscular disorders; it was granted the breakthrough therapy designation by the

    FDA

   . Another candidate, CPP-115, is a GABA-aminotransferase inhibitor that is in studies for infantile spasms -- a rare form of epileptic seizures. It holds orphan drug designations in the US and Europe. Catalyst Pharma was previously engaged in developing drugs to treat addiction.

   In 2016 the company announced plans to lay off 30% of its workforce in order to cut costs as it works to commercialize Firdapse. Catalyst Pharma had just been ordered by the FDA to run another trial of the candidate, which set the company back on its efforts to get Firdapse on the market.
