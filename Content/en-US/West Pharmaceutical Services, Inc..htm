   West Pharmaceutical Services makes the bits and pieces of health care products that you may not notice, but you'd have a hard time doing without. The firm makes drug packaging, disposable medical components, seals and stoppers for blood collection and syringe components, and injection systems. It also provides contract manufacturing services, including product design and commercialization, injection molding, and complex assemblies for pharmaceutical, diagnostic and medical device customers. The company was founded in 1923, and has grown to have a worldwide presence.

  <p>
   Following a restructure in early 2016, West Pharmaceutical has two primary divisions: Proprietary Products and Contract-Manufactured Products. In the first nine months of the fiscal year, Proprietary Products brought in around 80% of revenue, and Contract-Manufacturing Products the remainder.

  <p>
   Headquartered in Exton, PA, West has manufacturing facilities throughout the world, including locations in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Nebraska, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania in the US, and in Brazil, China, Germany, Denmark, France, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Serbia, Singapore, and the UK abroad. It also has affiliates in Mexico and Japan. Currently US sales make up about 50% of revenue, with sales in Europe close behind with about 40%.

  <p>
   West's products are distributed primarily through the company's direct sales force and distribution facilities, as well as through select contracted sales agents and regional distributors to the pharmaceutical, healthcare, and consumer products industries. Its 10 largest customers account for around 42% of revenue.

  <p>
   After a few years of steady growth, revenue dipped a touch in fiscal 2015 to $1.4 billion. Sales in Packaging Systems and Delivery Systems (the former segments prior to the 2016 restructure) fell 2% and 1% respectively amid unfavorable exchange rates. Product sales volumes and product price were up, but not enough to fully offset the currency-related fall.
  </p>
  <p>
   West Pharmaceutical's net income tends to track sales, and in fiscal 2015 declined 25% to $96 million. Other expenses, including a $47 million pension settlement and a $10.9 million executive retirement cost, also weight on profitability. Cash from operating activities ticked up 16% to $212 million.

  <p>
   The company continues to expand its product lines. In 2015, it launched Daikyo RUV (ready-to-use/validated) components, and in 2016, it introduced the 1-3mL NovaPure plunger a component for pre-filled delivery systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company expanded capabilities at its Scottsdale, Arizona facility to meet increased customer demand for the SmartDose Electronic Wearable Injector, and in 2015, broke ground on its Ireland manufacturing facility, which will manufacture packaging components for insulin injector cartridges and other high-value packaging components for injectable drugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   West Pharmaceutical invested in NanoPass Technologies in 2016 to advance its NanoPass clinical development efforts and support the launch of its microneedle-based devices.
