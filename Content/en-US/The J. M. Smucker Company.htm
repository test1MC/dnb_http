   The J. M. Smucker Company gets its bread and butter from more than just making and marketing jelly. The company, known for manufacturing its namesake Smucker's fruit spread and for selling the Jif peanut butter brand, has expanded its product portfolio to include Folgers, the #1-coffee brand in the US, as well as market leaders in espresso (Café Bustelo) and premium java (
   <company id="114220">
    Dunkin' Donuts
   </company>
   , licensed). Other top-shelf lines are Hungry Jack and Pillsbury baking mixes and frostings, Eagle canned milk, and Crisco shortening and oils, among others. Smucker's brands are sold to consumers through retail outlets in the US and Canada, with some products exported.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Smucker operates in the US, where it generates more than 90% of its revenue. It has an international presence, as well, through its extended reach into Canada, Mexico, and China. The company has established a small customer base along with some manufacturing facilities in Canada, and a limited export market.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has a principal distribution center in Canada, Nine sales and administrative offices in the US, and one each in China, Canada, and Mexico. Its corporate headquarters are located in Orrville, Ohio, and its Canadian headquarters are located in Markham, Ontario. The headquarters of its pet food business is in San Francisco; it has additional administrative facilities in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and in Burbank, California.
  </p>

  <p>
   Smucker's operations are divided among three business segments: US Retail Coffee, US Retail Pet Foods, and US Retail Consumer Foods. The US retail market segments are distinguished by product, which combined account for more than 85% of the company's sales. (Consumer Foods and Coffee each contributed 29% of revenues in fiscal 2016.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The International and Foodservice segment (13% of sales) comprises Smucker's portfolio of brands that are distributed both at home and abroad through retailers (grocery stores, mass merchandisers, club stores, and drug stores), as well as through food service suppliers and operators, such as restaurants, educational and health care institutions, and natural foods stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   After acquiring Big Heart, Smucker established its newest segment, US Retail Pet Foods. That unit contributed 29% of revenues in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   Smucker's long-term agreements include one with Dunkin' Donuts to manufacture and market its namesake coffee brand; the pact is effective until 2034. In the single-serve coffee market, Smucker holds sway through a manufacturing and distribution deal with
   <company id="45721">
    Keurig Green Mountain
   </company>
   and
   <company id="105284">
    Keurig
   </company>
   . Smucker also totes royalty-free licensing agreements with
   <company id="10639">
    General Mills

   ,
   <company id="104464">
    National Dairy
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41815">
    Nestlé

   to make and sell, respectively, Pillsbury flour and baking mixes, Borden canned milk, and Carnation canned milk.

  <p>
   Products are sold through direct sales and brokers to a broad range of retailers.
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   and subsidiaries account for more than 30% of sales. Indeed, the company's top 10 customers generates some 70% of Smucker's 2016 revenues. The company's International and Foodservice business distributes Smucker's products through retailers and food service suppliers and operators both domestically and internationally.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the US retail market segments, the company's products are primarily sold through direct sales and brokers to food retailers, food wholesalers, drug stores, club stores, mass merchandisers, discount and dollar stores, military commissaries, natural foods stores and distributors, and pet specialty stores. Its International and Foodservice products are distributed through retail channels and foodservice distributors and operators (e.g., restaurants, lodging, schools and universities, health care operators).

  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 Smucker's net sales increased by 37% due to higher sales from US Retail Pet foods driven by distribution gains for the Natural Balance brand and growth in Milk-Bone dog snacks.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income grew by 100% due to increased sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 the company's net cash provided by the operating activities increased by 99%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Smucker's strategy focuses on growth through owning and marketing the #1 brand name food products in North America, with potential for worldwide appeal. Acquisitions and manufacturing and distribution agreements underpin these ends.  As part of the company's long-term growth objectives, it is working to increase sales by 6% and earnings per share by more than 8% annually on average. While the sales contribution from acquisitions will vary from year to year, it expects organic growth, including new products, to add up to 4% per year and acquisitions to contribute the remainder over the long term. Products launched in 2015 included Café Bustelo K-Cup pods and Jif To Go Dippers; pipeline products range from Dunkin' Donuts K-Cup pods to Milk-Bone Good Morning dog vitamin treats.
  </p>
  <p>
   In response to ongoing declines in the green coffee futures market, Smucker lowered the prices of most of its US packaged coffee products (with the exception of its K-Cup pods) in 2015. It slashed prices by an average of 6%; the move was intended to bring coffee sales volumes back up.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the 2015 acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brands, the company instantly became a player in the growing pet food and snacks market. The company plans to pay down debt it took to finance that purchase over the next three to five years.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year, the company sold its US canned milk brands and operations to Eagle Family Foods, a subsidiary of funds affiliated with Kelso &amp; Company. The transaction included canned milk products that were primarily sold in US retail and food service channels under the Eagle Brand and Magnolia brands, along with other branded and private label trade names.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In early 2015, Smucker purchased
   <company id="40118">
    Big Heart Pet Brands
   </company>
   in a cash and stock transaction valued at $5.8 billion (including $2.6 billion of debt). Smucker gained a huge product portfolio with the deal, adding such notable names as Mew Mix, Milk-Bone, Kibbles 'n Bits, Natural Balance, and Milo's Kitchen, among others, to its own list of brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the company bought Sahale Snacks, a maker of nut and fruit mixes. The Seattle-based company rings up an estimated $50 million in annual sales from warehouse clubs, convenience stores, and supermarkets. In 2013, Smucker purchased privately held $45 million-in-sales Enray to strengthen its natural foods business. Enray, which is based in California, is a supplier of organic grains, beans, and seeds.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Jerome Smucker began operating a steam-powered cider mill in 1897 for farmers in Orrville, Ohio, but he found that his biggest business was selling apple butter made using a secret Smucker family recipe. By the 1920s The J. M. Smucker Company had begun producing a full line of preserves and jellies, and in 1935 it acquired its first fruit-processing operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under Jerome's grandson, Paul Smucker, the company gained widespread national distribution by the mid-1960s. Tim Smucker succeeded his father, Paul, as president in 1981, then as chairman in 1987, when his brother Richard became president.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's growth has been enhanced through the development of its industrial fruit fillings business and acquisitions of domestic natural juice and peanut butter companies, including Knudsen &amp; Sons (1984), After the Fall (1994), and Laura Scudder's (from
   <company id="42261">
    National Grape Co-op
   </company>
   , 1994). It has gradually expanded internationally through acquisitions. In 1993 it acquired the jam, preserves, and pie-filling unit of Canada's Culinar. In a 1998 deal Smucker purchased Australia's Allowrie jam and Lackersteens marmalade lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Smucker sold its flagging Mrs. Smith's frozen pie business to
   <company id="10593">
    Flowers
   </company>
   in 1997, less than two years after buying the unit from
   <company id="10841">
    Kellogg
   </company>
   . It bought
   <company id="103392">
    Kraft
   </company>
   's domestic fruit spread unit in 1997 and in 1999 purchased the northwestern Adams peanut butter business from
   <company id="42633">
    Pro-Fac Cooperative
   </company>
   . Smucker kept the Adams name but shifted packaging to its Pennsylvania peanut butter plant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Spreading into retail, the company opened a store in 1999 in its hometown of Orrville and then launched online and catalog sales. Also that year Smucker bought a fruit filling plant in Brazil from
   <company id="41774">
    Groupe Danone
   </company>
   , a major customer. During 2000 the company's Henry Jones Foods subsidiary (Australia) purchased Taylor Foods (sauces, marinades).
  </p>
  <p>
   Smucker acquired
   <company id="10797">
    International Flavors &amp; Fragrances
   </company>
   ' formulated fruit and vegetable preparation businesses in 2001. Moving beyond its stronghold in natural peanut butter brands, the next year Smucker purchased the Jif peanut butter and Crisco cooking oil and shortening brands from
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   . The $670 million purchase price for Jif and Crisco included shifting 53% of Smucker stock into the hands of P&amp;G shareholders.
  </p>
  <p>
   A decision to concentrate on North America led to the $37 million sale of Australian subsidiary Henry Jones Foods in 2004. Also that year, Smucker sold its operations in Brazil to
   <company id="40079">
    Cargill
   </company>
   and closed down two fruit processing plants in California and Oregon. Its purchase of International Multifoods that year added an array of US brands to the Smucker family, including Pillsbury flour, baking mixes, and ready-to-spread frostings; Hungry Jack pancake mixes, syrup, and potato side dishes; Martha White baking mixes and ingredients; and PET evaporated milk brands. Canadian brands included Robin Hood flour and baking mixes, Bick's pickles and condiments, and Golden Temple flour and rice.
  </p>
  <p>
   To further its strategy of concentrating on its core retail brands, in 2005 Smucker sold its US foodservice and bakery business, and the Canadian operations of Gourmet Baker (all part of its International Multifoods acquisition) to Value Creation Partners. The following year, the company sold its Canadian grain-based foodservice operations and industrial businesses to
   <company id="40079">
    Cargill
   </company>
   and
   <company id="57218">
    CHS Inc.
   </company>
   The operations were integrated into leading US flour miller
   <company id="109955">
    Horizon Milling
   </company>
   (which is jointly owned by Cargill and CHS). Adding to its name-brand offerings in 2006, Smucker acquired the White Lily brand of flours, baking mixes, and frozen biscuits from
   <company id="61018">
    C.H. Guenther
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company extended its baking offerings with the 2007 acquisition of sweetened condensed and evaporated milk producer,
   <company id="106570">
    Eagle Family Foods Holdings
   </company>
   . Smucker paid $133 million in cash and $115 million in assumed debt for it. Eagle is a good fit with Smucker's PET milk products. Given Smucker's size and subsequent bargaining power with food retailers (including
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   ,
   <em>
    the
   </em>
   giant in US food retailing) and Eagle's domination of the North American canned-milk sector (it is the largest producer of evaporated and sweetened condensed milk in the US and Canada), the pairing of the two companies was a sensible move for both.
