  <p>
   McBride has experienced a slow decline in its revenue the last few years. Its revenues dipped by 5% from 2014 to 2015 primarily as a result of the weaker Euro. In addition, its UK segment experienced a 5% drop in sales due to price reductions, lower private label volumes, and a decline in contract manufacturing volumes. Western Europe segment revenue also decreased by 6%, while Rest of the World sales dipped by 6% during 2015.

  <p>
   McBride's roots reach back to the late 1800s when small laundry owner Camille Simon developed a cleaning product from an extract of soap. The company was not established under the McBride name until 1927.
