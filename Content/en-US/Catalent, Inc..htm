  <p>
   Catalent's revenue has remained relatively flat over the past five years. In fiscal 2016 (ended June), it rose 1% to $1.85 billion. This increase was due to growth in all segments, as demand for the group's products increased. These gains were partially offset by a volume decrease as the company temporarily suspended manufacturing operations at a facility in France during the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income, which had risen sharply (particularly in 2014 when the company entered the black, and 2015, when it rose more than 200% to $212.2 million), dropped 47% to $111.5 million in 2016. Higher selling, general, and administrative expenses drove the decline in profits.
  </p>

  <p>
   Catalent's business strategy focuses on growing its businesses in development solutions and advanced delivery technologies, clinical trial supplies, and advanced blow/fill/seal aseptic delivery technology for respiratory, ophthalmic and other products. It is also working to offer integrated solutions for developing and supplying injectable biologics and complex pharmaceutical products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other growth plans include adding new service offerings and expanding into new market segments. The company is also looking to add new partnerships that will allow for increased participation in licensing and commercialization profit-sharing opportunities. In addition, the company is capitalizing on increased manufacturing capacity in its oral technologies and sterile technologies businesses, where it invested in growing market segments such as pre-filled syringes and oral dose products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 Catalent introduced 184 new products, an increase of 12% from the new product introductions in fiscal 2015.

  <p>
   In 2016, Catalent acquired Australian pharmaceutical packaging firm Pharmapak Technologies. The acquisition provided the company with packaging capabilities to promote growth in the Asia/Pacific region (where it has recently added new labs and manufacturing facilities).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also purchased California-based Pharmatek Laboratories in a deal which brought spray drying technology into its drug formulation and delivery portfolio as well as expanding its early-phase development capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In another deal, Catalent acquired Accucaps Industries, a Canada-based maker of over-the-counter softgels, in early 2017. That purchase included two manufacturing/packaging facilities in Ontario and boosted the company's capability to provide turnkey services.
