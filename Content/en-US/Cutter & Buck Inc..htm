   Relatively unknown less than a decade ago, Cutter &amp; Buck has climbed onto the leader board of the nation's top makers of golf apparel. The firm sells men's and women's golf apparel and other sportswear through golf pro shops, resorts, and specialty stores throughout North America, as well as to corporate accounts. It sells its products in other countries through distributors. Most of its sales come from men's apparel. Cutter &amp; Buck divides its apparel into two lines: the ephemeral fashion line, with brighter colors, and the seasonless and less-expensive classics line. Its corporate marketing division puts company logos on products for corporate golf events and programs.

   Cutter &amp; Buck aims to please both experienced golfers and those who don't know the difference between a birdie and a bogey, as well as eco-conscious enthusiasts. The company has stared down the rival lines of Greg Norman (by
   <company id="11266">
    Reebok
   </company>
   ) and Jack Nicklaus by making attire featuring natural fabrics, detailed embroidery, and a casual look. Its Annika Collection is named after famed golfer Annika Sorenstam and features colorful women's golf attire. Taking advantage of greater customer awareness of environmental issues, the company sells organic cotton shirts for a price slightly higher than non-organic cotton shirts.

  <p>
   Apparel industry veteran Harvey Jones and sportswear designer Joey Rodolfo established Jones/Rodolfo in 1990 to design and market high-quality, innovative golf clothes and outerwear for men. Growth was steady for the next few years, as the company increased the number of golf pro shops and specialty retailers, such as
   <company id="14261">
    Nordstrom
   </company>
   and
   <company id="105266">
    Bloomingdale's
   </company>
   , that carried its products. Jones/Rodolfo went public in 1995 and changed its name to Cutter &amp; Buck, the fabricated name of its clothing line.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 the company moved into Europe, marketing its apparel in the birthplace of golf. The next year Rodolfo left the company, founding women's golf apparel company Resort Two. Early in 1998 Cutter &amp; Buck launched its own line of sports apparel for women. The company opened its first retail store later that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 2001 Cutter &amp; Buck had opened 11 more stores and an e-commerce Web site. In March 2002 the company announced it would close its direct operations in Europe but continue business there through a licensee. In April Harvey Jones stepped down as chairman and CEO but remained on as a brand strategist. Cutter &amp; Buck admitted in August that it had discovered accounting irregularities for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 and would restate those results. In November the company said it would begin closing all of its loss-making retail stores in an effort to focus on its more profitable business of designing and marketing high-end sportswear.
  </p>
  <p>
   After restating its financial statements, the company implemented a restructuring program to reduce spending, which included streamlining its domestic and international sales operations and eliminating some of its product lines. In 2003 the company discontinued its retail stores business (comprising 10 remaining locations) to focus on its wholesale business. By April 2003 all retail stores were closed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fran Conley transitioned out of the roles of chairman and CEO in September 2004. VP and manager of the order fulfillment group, Bill Swint, temporarily took on the role of president and CEO until John Wyatt was named to the position in December 2004. Director Doug Southern was named chairman. The move came at the end of a two-year turnaround process for Cutter &amp; Buck.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's former president Martin Marks pleaded guilty in December 2004 to company fraud dating back to 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wyatt resigned in 2006 and was replaced by company SVP and CFO Ernie Johnson.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sweden-based New Wave Group AB acquired the company in 2007 for $156 million.
