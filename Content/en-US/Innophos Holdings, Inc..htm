   Innophos Holdings adds a dash of its phosphate products to food, beverages, toothpaste, detergents, and asphalt. Innophos manufactures specialty phosphates used in consumer products, pharmaceuticals, and industrial applications.  Customers use the company's phosphates to improve the quality and performance of a broad range of products, from electronics and textiles to pharmaceuticals, water, and detergents. Innophos divides its business into three segments: specialty salts and specialty acids; purified phosphoric acid; and granular triple super phosphates (GSTP), a fertilizer.

  <p>
   Although North America does account for about three-quarters of its sales, Innophos sells globally. The company has manufacturing plants in the US (Nashville, TN; Chicago Heights, IL; Chicago (Waterway), IL; Geismar, LA; Ogden, UT; North Salt Lake, UT; Paterson, NJ; and Green Pond, SC); Canada (Port Maitland, ON); China (Taicang); and Mexico (Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, and San Jose de Iturbide, Guanajuato).

  <p>
   The company's revenues grew by 6% in 2012 thanks to higher selling prices increases. Specialty Phosphates revenues went up 5.1%, partially offset by lower pricing in GSTP and other non-specialty phosphate products, with fertilizer market prices well below 2011 levels. Product volumes increased 3.5% due to the effects of acquisitions in the Specialty Phosphates segment. Higher fertilizer sales were also a factor.

  <p>
   Innophos reported net income of $74.2 million in 2012 (14% down on 2011) as the result of increased costs of goods sold.

   In 2012 the company bought New York-based Triarco Industries for $46 million. Triarco makes custom ingredients for the food, beverage, and dietary supplement industries, specializing in botanical and enzyme based ingredients that provide important nutritional benefits and are often formulated with specialty phosphates and bioactive minerals.

   To complement its Kelatron business, Innophos acquired Utah-based AMT Labs in 2012 for $27 million. AMT specializes in mineral ingredients essential to the human diet that it manufactures in various forms (including chelates) to be easily digested. With the combination of AMT and Kelatron, Innophos became a leading US producer of high-growth bioactive mineral ingredients.
