   Keurig knows that time is of the essence. The company makes a hot beverage system that brews a single cup of coffee or tea in less than a minute. The single-cup system uses portioned-product "K-Cups" designed for use with its machines. Some 200,000 of its systems are located in offices, food service outlets, and homes in North America. The system was developed in 1998, when the firm licensed

   (GMCR) to pack its specialty coffees in Keurig's patented K-Cup. (GMCR later Keurig for about $104 million.) Other partnerships include coffee roasters Gloria Jean's, Timothy's World Coffee, specialty tea makers

   Buying Keurig was a smart move on GMCR's part. Not only is Keurig the company's cash cow, but it is also its growth engine. Indeed, growth and adoption of Keurig Single Cup Brewing systems, including the brewer and related portion packs, is central to GMCR's growth plan, which envisions a Keurig brewer on every counter and a beverage for every occasion.
  </p>
        <p>
   In recent years the market for single-cup coffee makers has grown tremendously, with Keurig leading the pack (ahead of
   <company id="10811">
    J.M. Smucker
   </company>
   and
   <company id="15745">
    Starbucks
   </company>
   ). In 2013 13% of Americans drank coffee that began as a pod, capsule, of K-Cup, up from 4% in 2010. And single-cup sales are expected to increase sixfold between 2013 and 2016. While coffee accounts for 75% of the single-cup market, tea, hot cider, and cocoa are also popular single-cup beverages. Keurig machines are becoming ubiquitous in offices and homes nationwide.
  </p>
        <p>
   While Keurig is the market leader, it clearly has room to grow. In addition to the K-Cup and Vue platforms for home and office use, the company launched the Rivo platform in partnership with Italy
   <company id="93162">
    Lavazza SpA
   </company>
   for at home brewing of cappuccino and lattes. A Keurig Cold System, which will deliver freshly-prepared carbonated, sparkling, and still beverages its expected to launch in fiscal 2015. To tout home use, the company operates a Keurig store in a mall outside of Boston to showcase its full line of brewing systems and vast selection of coffee brands and other hot beverages. The store has a demonstration and tasting area.
  </p>
        <p>
   Not surprisingly, competition has heated up in the single-cup coffee niche. Rival Procter &amp; Gamble joined the fray and Keurig battled a patent lawsuit with
   <company id="55825">
    Kraft Foods
   </company>
   , Kraft Foods Global, and Tassimo Corporation -- all Kraft entities. The settlement was announced in November 2008 with Keurig receiving some $17 million for Kraft being granted a limited, non-exclusive license for certain Keurig US and global patents. The company's K-Cup line was not part of the litigation.
