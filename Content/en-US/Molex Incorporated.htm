   That socket you slide your SD or SIM card into? It might have come from Molex. The company is one of the world's largest makers of electronic, electrical, and fiber-optic connectors and switches. Its sockets, cable assemblies, and other products are used in a wide variety of settings, including automobiles, computers, consumer electronics, home appliances, industrial machinery, mobile phones (including the iPhone), and telecommunications equipment. Molex sells through distributors and directly to manufacturers that have included

   Molex operates in two segments, Connector, and Custom and Electrical. Connector products include wire-to-board, bard-to-board, wire-to-wire, input/output (IO), and sockets. Included in the other segment are Fiber Optic Products, Antennas, Membrane Switches, PCB Assemblies, and Solid State Lighting. In previous financial reporting, the Connector segment accounted for 71% of sales.

  <p>
   The Asia-Pacific region (including China, India, and Japan) is Molex's largest market accounting for about 60% of sales. The US and Mexico contribute about 30%, with Europe (Italy, Ireland, and Poland) bringing in the rest.

   The acquisition by Koch Industries has allowed Molex to regroup as a private company not worried about reactions of analysts and investors. Some visible signs of change have been the company's introduction of devices for the medical market. An overall growing area that accounted for a small percentage of Molex's sales. New medical products under its MediSpec line include the Medical Plastic Circular (MPC) Interconnect System, which provide medical OEMs with a cost-competitive connector; Non-Magnetic RF Contacts and Modules, designed for manufacturers of MRI machine and other types of diagnostic imaging equipment; Hybrid Circular MT Cable Assemblies and Receptacles, which can streamline the number of connectors required in medical systems; and Molded Interconnect Device/Laser Direct Structuring, which help medical device designers integrate complex electrical and mechanical features into compact applications.

   In a sign that Molex is trying to vigorously penetrate other geographic markets, it started a blog in the Korean language. The blog should enable Mole to communicate more effectively with customers, partners, and employees in South Korea.

  <p>
   While Molex is the source of a wide variety of connectors and electronic component, it can always have more in its portfolio. In January 2015, Molex acquired SDP Telecom, which designs and makes RF/microwave products used in wireless communications. The move broadens the RF/microwave offerings of Molex. Wireless infrastructure equipment makers use SDP's products to improve signal transmission efficiency over wireless networks.
  </p>
  <p>
   In September 2013, Molex acquired Germany's FCT Electronics Group, a maker of of custom mixed-layout connectors and cable assemblies with operations in Germany, the Czech Republic, Thailand, and the US. The purchase expanded Molex's presence in the medical electronics, industrial, telecom, and aerospace industries.

  <p>
   Conglomerate Koch Industries acquired Molex in December 2013 for about $7.2 billion ($38.50 per share). A significant portion of the proceeds will go to the Krehbiel family, whose development of a new kind of plastic gave birth to Molex. The deal involved the merger of Koch Industries' subsidiary, Koch Connectors, with and into Molex. Molex is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Koch Industries and retains its Illinois headquarters and management.

  <p>
   In 1938 Frederick Krehbiel, the son of Swiss Mennonites, on a lark began mixing waste substances coal tar and asbestos. The result was a thick, black plastic material that he called Molex, combining a reference to its "mol"-ded state with the modern-sounding "ex." That year he founded Molex Products Company in Brookfield, Illinois. Soon the substance was being used to make everything from flower pots and salt shakers to moisture-resistant bushings and radiator controls.
  </p>
  <p>
   Frederick's son, John Sr. (known simply as Senior), joined the company in the 1940s and, recognizing the material's electrical insulating properties, expanded its uses to include coatings for US Army land mines (masking them from enemy detectors) and sheathing for electrical components. Senior also shifted the company's focus to connectors that linked electronic components. Because it was still unproven by the start of WWII, Molex was one of the few plastic substances not restricted to use by the war effort; manufacturers flocked to it as a substitute. (The original Molex product later became obsolete due to newer materials, such as nylon.)
  </p>
  <p>
   By the 1950s and 1960s, Molex, under Senior's leadership, had targeted its connector sales toward manufacturers of televisions, ranges, washer-dryers, and other consumer electronics and appliances.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Senior asked his son Frederick to use his foreign experience (he had attended school in England) to the company's advantage, Molex in the late 1960s began an international expansion. Frederick thought it wise to build plants overseas to lower costs and be closer to customers; in 1970 the company opened its first non-US factory, in Japan. Molex went public in 1972 and relocated its headquarters to Lisle, Illinois. Senior's older son, John Krehbiel Jr., was named president in 1975.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the 1980s Molex was the world's 10th-largest maker of electronic connectors. Long cautious in dealings, the company in the late 1980s went on a spending spree. Molex bought stakes in a variety of small companies to position itself in such lucrative locations as China. In 1989 the company bought an 85% interest in Ulti Mate and gained a stronger connector presence in the military market. Fred Krehbiel was named CEO in 1988.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chairman John Sr. died in 1993. Molex, which more than doubled its global manufacturing capacity in the 1990s, opened new factories in China and Puerto Rico in 1997. In 1999 the company acquired Cardell Corporation, a privately held maker of automotive connectors; it also bought Silent Systems (heat sinks) and Indian connector maker Mafatlal Micron. That year Fred and John Jr. became co-chairmen and co-CEOs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Molex reported record sales thanks to a wide variety of new products and strong growth in its telecommunications and automotive offerings. During that year the company bought
   <company id="46359">
    Axsys Technologies
   </company>
   ' Beau Interconnects division for about $30 million. Fred and John Jr. handed over the CEO reins to Joseph King in 2001 (Fred and John Jr. remained co-chairmen).
  </p>
  <p>
   Facing dismal conditions across its target markets in 2001-02, Molex instituted a variety of cost-cutting measures including reductions in executive pay, shortened work-weeks, and a small number of plant closures and layoffs. Molex closed facilities in Puerto Rico, Slovakia, the UK, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Molex acquired France-based Connecteurs Cinch SA, adding manufacturing facilities in France, Portugal, India, and China. That year Molex also acquired privately held INCEP Technologies, a maker of power delivery interconnect, high-density packaging, and thermal management products for the semiconductor industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   An accounting irregularity in inventory calculations -- and the resulting request by company auditors for a management representation letter from a different CFO -- led Molex to name an acting CFO in late 2004, make adjustments to 2004 financial results, and delay filing its quarterly SEC report. The auditors also asked that both the CEO and CFO no longer serve as officers of the company and requested additional disclosures; Molex initially refused, and auditor Deloitte &amp; Touche resigned. Late in 2004, however, Molex announced King's resignation and Fred Krehbiel's assumption of the CEO post. (Krehbiel served as CEO until mid-2005, when Martin Slark was named to the position.) Ernst &amp; Young was appointed as auditor.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Molex acquired
   <company id="15175">
    Woodhead Industries
   </company>
   for about $256 million in cash, one of the biggest acquisitions the company had ever attempted. The company assumed debt and outstanding stock options for Woodhead, a manufacturer of network and electrical infrastructure products, as part of the transaction.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 Molex acquired AFlextech, a Taiwan-based flexible circuit manufacturer. AFlextech's products are found in cell phones, computer peripherals, and automobiles. The deal not only gave Molex a bigger piece of the flexible circuit pie, but also an additional foothold in Asia.
