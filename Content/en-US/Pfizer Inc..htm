   Pfizer pfabricates pfarmaceuticals pfor quite a pfew inpfirmities. The company is one of the world's largest research-based pharmaceuticals firms, producing medicines for ailments in fields including cardiovascular health, metabolism, oncology, immunology, and neurology. Its top prescription products include cholesterol-lowering Lipitor, pain management drugs Celebrex and Lyrica, pneumonia vaccine Prevnar, and erectile dysfunction treatment Viagra, as well as arthritis drug Enbrel, antibiotic Zyvox, and high-blood-pressure therapy Norvasc. Consumer health products include such leading brands as Advil, Centrum, and Robitussin. Pfizer and
   <company id="12311">
    Allergan
   </company>
   called off their $160 billion merger in 2016, citing tax reasons.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2014 Pfizer reorganized its business into three operating segments. The Global Established Pharmaceutical segment (or GEP; it accounted for nearly half of Pfizer's total sales in 2015) covers sterile injectable products and the company's biosimilar development portfolio. Collaborations and existing agreements, including those with Mylan Inc. in Japan, Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. in China, and Laborat√≥rio Teuto Brasileiro S.A. in Brazil, fall under the GEP umbrella.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Global Innovative Pharmaceutical segment (GIP, accounting for 29% of sales) includes immunology and inflammation, cardiovascular and metabolic, neuroscience and pain, rare diseases, and women's and men's health. The Global Vaccines, Oncology, and Consumer Healthcare group (VOC, 26% of sales) works on vaccines and other products for oncology and consumer healthcare.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pfizer's largest patent expiration -- that of former #1 global top-selling drug Lipitor, which brought in $11 billion to $12 billion in annual sales during its prime -- took effect in the US market in 2011. Pfizer has retained some Lipitor revenues through sales in other markets and through direct-to-consumer programs, but it has lost exclusivity in all major markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In more recent patent expirations, Pfizer lost US exclusivity for Rapamune, Detrol LA, and Celebrex (in 2014). In early 2015, versions of Zyvox became subject to generic competition in the US. The company has also recently lost exclusivity for Xalatan, Xalacom, Detrol LA, Viagra, Inspra, Lyrica, and Celebrex in most major European markets. In Canada, it lost exclusivity for Lyrica.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is working diligently to launch new blockbusters from its robust R&amp;D pipeline to make up for the off-patent losses and return to revenue growth. The firm has some 90 projects in clinical stages of development, including drugs for Alzheimer's disease, psoriasis, diabetes, lung cancer, epilepsy, pain, and infections.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from biopharmaceutical products contributed 92% of total revenues in 2015. Pfizer recorded direct product revenues of more than $1 billion for each of 10 biopharmaceutical products: Lyrica, the Prevnar suite of products, Enbrel, Celebrex, Lipitor, Viagra, Zyvox, Sutent, Norvasc, and the Premarin line of products. Combined, these accounted for more than 40% of total biopharmaceutical revenues that year.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   While the US remains Pfizer's largest market (accounting for about 45% of revenues), the drugmaker has a strong global presence, with international countries accounting for more than half of sales. The company operates in more than 75 international markets, including Japan (8% of sales), Australia, Canada, Finland, New Zealand, Scandinavia, South Korea, and countries in Western Europe; the company is also growing in emerging markets such as Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia, and Turkey.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pfizer has major manufacturing facilities in Belgium, China, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Puerto Rico, Singapore, and the US.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company markets its pharmaceuticals directly to doctors, hospitals, nurses, pharmacists, benefit management firms, managed care organizations, employer groups, and patients themselves. Most of its sales are conducted through wholesale distributors including
   <company id="10977">
    McKesson,
   </company>
   <company id="12894">
    Cardinal Health,
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40016">
    AmerisourceBergen
   </company>
   , each of which account for around 10% of annual revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also markets directly to consumers in the US through direct advertising, including television, print, and digital ads, as well as in-store promotions. It sells its consumer health care products through distributors, pharmacies, retail chains, grocery stores, convenience stores, and other channels.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advertising expenses totaled some $3.1 billion in 2015 and 2014, up from $3 billion in 2013.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Pfizer has seen a slow revenue decline since 2011 and 2015 was no exception. That year revenue dropped 2% to $48.8 billion due to the expiration of the co-promotion agreement for Spiriva. It also lost exclusivity for Celebrex, Rapamune, BeneFIX, and Zyvox in the US and Lyrica in Europe. Meanwhile, sales of Lipitor and Norvasc continued to slip, and several other products experienced declines. Those declines were partially offset by growing sales of Prevnar 13, Ibrance, Eliquis, Lyrica, Xeljanz, Viagra (GIP), and Nexium 24HR, particularly in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the company continues to invest in research and development to find new blockbusters, its expenses have risen. After peaking in 2013, net income fell in both 2014 and 2015. In the latter year, it dropped 24% to $6.9 billion as a result of higher restructuring charges (including employee termination costs), acquisition-related expenses, and cost-cutting initiatives. Cash flow from operations has generally been on the decline for the past five years; in 2015, it fell 14% to $14.5 billion.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Though it continues to grow through R&amp;D efforts and acquisitions, Pfizer has been conducting extensive cost-cutting programs in recent years to counteract losses from patent expiration. It has also been selling non-core assets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the past few years Pfizer has been streamlining operations at its research facilities with the overall goal of reducing its adjusted R&amp;D spend to between $6.5 billion and $7 billion. (However, in 2014 R&amp;D expenses topped the $8 billion mark, largely due to an arrangement with Merck to develop potential cancer treatments; those expenses dropped back down in 2015.) As part of this strategy, the company is focusing on its most promising late-stage drug candidates in six key therapeutic areas: immunology and inflammation; cardiovascular and metabolic; oncology; pain and neurology; vaccines; and rare diseases. Pfizer has also increasingly relied on partnerships to build its R&amp;D activities, including some team-ups with fellow top pharma companies such as
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Myers Squibb
   </company>
   (cardiovascular and metabolic candidates), and
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   (HIV).
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to partnering with Merck on the development of a cancer antibody in 2014, Pfizer entered into a collaborative agreement
   <company id="47033">
    OPKO
   </company>
   to develop and commercialize that company's long-acting human growth hormone for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency. In 2015 it paid OPKO $295 million and received the exclusive license to commercialize the hormone worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Recent regulatory approvals include
   <company id="144161">
    US FDA
   </company>
   approvals for Xeljanz (for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (for breast cancer treatment), both received in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Pfizer agreed to grant licenses to the method-of-use patent for Viagra to
   <company id="11030">
    Mylan
   </company>
   , Watson, and
   <company id="140196">
    Apotex
   </company>
   , allowing those firms to provide generic versions of the drug beginning in late 2017.
   <company id="52434">
    Teva
   </company>
   has also been approved to manufacture the drug at that time.
  </p>
  <p>
   No stranger to large acquisitions, Pfizer in 2014 made a $100 billion offer for fellow pharma firm
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   . The deal, which was repeatedly rebuffed, would have boosted Pfizer's R&amp;D efforts, moved its headquarters to tax-friendly England, and delivered promising oncology drug candidates. Pfizer eventually gave up on the deal, but took a stab at another large merger, this time with Allergan.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 Pfizer and Ireland-based Allergan terminated their planned megamerger, which would have been the largest-ever health care deal. The $160 billion deal would have created the world's largest drug maker, surpassing
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   . The failed transaction was structured as an inversion merger, through which Pfizer would have adopted Allergan's home in tax-friendly Ireland. However, pushback from the US government (seeking to prevent losing corporate taxes) ultimately proved too much for the two companies, and the deal was canceled.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the Allergan deal was called off, Pfizer began considering its options including making new acquisitions, divesting various operations, and splitting into two businesses. In September 2016 the company acquired cancer biotech
   <company id="148680">
    Medivation
   </company>
   for some $14 billion. Through that deal, it gained the prostate cancer blockbuster Xtandi as well as a development pipeline of other oncology treatments (fitting in with Pfizer's efforts to expand its own oncology portfolio).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also bought the small-molecule antibiotics business of AstraZeneca in a deal that could ultimately be valued at up to $1.6 billion. That deal brought the approved drugs Merrem, Zinforo, and Zavicefta to Pfizer's fold.
  </p>
  <p>
   A year after its 2015 $17 billion acquisition of Hospira, Pfizer announced plans to sell Hospira Infusion Systems (HIS) to
   <company id="10672">
    ICU Medical
   </company>
   for $1 billion; the deal closed in early 2017. HIS was Pfizer's global infusion therapy business and included IV pumps and devices. Through the deal, Pfizer gained a stake of about 17% in ICU Medical.
  </p>
  <p>
   After much speculation, Pfizer announced in September 2016 that it has dropped any plans for splitting into two separate public companies.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Pfizer has made a number of acquisitions to beef up its development-stage and commercialized offerings and ward off losses from patent expiration. In 2014 Pfizer acquired Baxter International's vaccine portfolio and manufacturing facility in Austria for about $635 million. It also bought InnoPharma, a pharmaceutical development company with a focus on sterile injectables for the treatment of tumors and central nervous disorders. In early 2015 Pfizer acquired a controlling stake in startup Redvax, a spinoff of Swiss biotech firm Redbiotec; the acquisition provides Pfizer with access to a preclinical human cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine candidate.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2015, Pfizer bought
   <company id="132482">
    Hospira
   </company>
   , which provides specialty injectable drugs and infusion technologies, for approximately $17 billion. The acquisition boosts Pfizer's GEP segment by expanding its portfolio, adding among other products several marketed biosimilars and sterile injectables from Hospira's portolio. Pfizer sold Hospira's infusion systems operations to
   <company id="10672">
    ICU Medical
   </company>
   for $1 billion in early 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company bought
   <company id="140017">
    Anacor Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   , which has a non-steroid ointment for the treatment of eczema in its pipeline, for $5.2 billion. The deal was the first acquisition after the planned merger with Allergan fell apart.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Pfizer was founded by cousins Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart in 1849.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Charles Pfizer and his cousin, confectioner Charles Erhart, began making chemicals in Brooklyn in 1849. Products included camphor, citric acid, and santonin (an early antiparasitic). The company, incorporated in 1900 as Chas. Pfizer &amp; Co., was propelled into the modern drug business when it was asked to mass-produce penicillin for the war effort in 1941.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pfizer discovered Terramycin and introduced it in 1950. Three years later it bought drugmaker Roerig, its first major acquisition. In the 1950s the company opened branches in Belgium, Canada, Cuba, Mexico, and the UK and began manufacturing in Asia, Europe, and South America. By the mid-1960s Pfizer had worldwide sales of more than $200 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beginning in the late 1950s, Pfizer made Salk and Sabin polio vaccines and added new drugs, such as Diabinese (antidiabetic, 1958) and Vibramycin (antibiotic, 1967). It moved into consumer products in the early 1960s, buying BenGay, Desitin, and cosmetics maker Coty (sold 1992). It bought hospital products company Howmedica in 1972 (sold 1998) and heart-valve maker Shiley in 1979.
  </p>
  <p>
   When growth slowed in the 1970s, new chairman Edmund Pratt increased R&amp;D expenditures, resulting in Minipress (antihypertensive, 1975), Feldene (arthritis pain reliever, 1980), and Glucotrol (antidiabetic, 1984). Licensing agreements with foreign companies let Pfizer sell antihypertensive Procardia XL and antibiotic Cefobid. In the 1980s Pfizer expanded its hospital products division, buying 18 product lines and companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lawsuits over the failure of about 500 heart valves and the alleged falsification of records led Pfizer to divest most of Shiley's operations in 1992. Drugs released that year included antidepressant Zoloft, antibiotic Zithromax, and cardiovascular agent Norvasc.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 Pfizer bought SmithKline Beecham's animal health business and
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   's Bain de Soleil skin care line (sold 1999).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Pfizer began promoting Lipitor, the cholesterol-lowering drug discovered by partner
   <company id="11606">
    Warner-Lambert
   </company>
   ; it grabbed nearly 13% of the market in its first four months. Pfizer also launched Aricept,
   <company id="56282">
    Eisai
   </company>
   's treatment for Alzheimer's disease.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pfizer made headlines (and lots of men happy) when the company won FDA approval for Viagra in 1998. The little blue pill became a pop icon, and made the company a household name.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Warner-Lambert said in 1999 that it would merge with American Home Products (now
   <company id="10093">
    Wyeth
   </company>
   ), Pfizer sued to prevent the union and eventually succeeded with its own hostile bid. The merger with Warner-Lambert was completed, and CEO William Steere retired. Pfizer also sold its animal feed additive business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pfizer,
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   in 2001 formed a joint venture to sell software to automate prescription writing and other administrative procedures in physicians' offices. Determined to narrow its focus on pharmaceuticals, the company in 2002 sold its Tetra fish care, then sold its Adams confectionery and Schick-Wilkinson Sword shaving products businesses in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Pfizer purchased rival Pharmacia for $54 billion, making it the world's largest research-based pharmaceutical company. Following its two giant acquisitions, the company trimmed some 20,000 people. In 2004 Pfizer acquired the research divisions of
   <company id="104986">
    QuoreX
   </company>
   , which develops anti-bacterial drugs targeting hospital infections. It also purchased Esperion Therapeutics, a developer of cholesterol drugs headed by Lipitor discoverer Roger Newton, for $1.2 billion. (Pfizer eventually spun Esperion back off into a private, independent entity in 2008 after its development drugs didn't pan out as planned, although Pfizer retained some assets and a minority stake in the spinoff.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In the wake of revelations that
   <company id="11326">
    Merck
   </company>
   's Vioxx increased the risk for cardiovascular diseases in 2004, Pfizer reviewed its own COX-2 pain medication, Celebrex. Preliminary studies showed Celebrex increased the risk of heart attack; Pfizer didn't pull Celebrex off the market but did add a "black box" warning of possible cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risks. (In 2008 Pfizer reached an agreement in principle to settle for $894 million most of its pending patient lawsuits alleging that Celebrex caused heart attacks and strokes.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions in 2005 included the purchase of Angiosyn, a private biotech working on an anti-angiogenesis therapy for macular degeneration (which can lead to blindness), and Idun Pharmaceuticals, which was developing apoptosis (programmed cell death) inhibitors to treat liver disease, cancer, and other diseases.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company scooped up research partner
   <company id="100477">
    Vicuron Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   , which had two anti-infective (anidulafungin and dalbavancin) drugs under review by the FDA, and Bioren, which has developed a technology that helps drugs last longer through antibody optimization. (Pfizer divested Vicuron as part of its cost-cutting efforts in 2009.)
  </p>
  <p>
   While acquiring new holdings on the pharmaceutical front, Pfizer trimmed its non-pharmaceutical businesses between 2003 and 2005, including operations it acquired with Pharmacia and its European generics portfolio. The company's animal health division sold off its diagnostics products division (which manufactured tests for bovine tuberculosis and paratuberculosis) to Swiss firm Prionics.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the consumer health care front, the population's increased germaphobia translated into high dollars for Pfizer following the acquisition of Purell. However, Pfizer later unloaded its consumer unit altogether, refocusing efforts onto its core pharmaceutical business.
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   in 2006 acquired the whole consumer caboodle, including such brands as Benadryl, Listerine, Nicorette, Rolaids, and Sudafed, for $16.6 billion. To comply with regulatory requirements for the deal, the companies sold Zantac marketing rights in the US to
   <company id="138554">
    Boehringer Ingelheim
   </company>
   for $510 million; they sold the Cortizone, Kaopectate, and Unisom brands to
   <company id="12953">
    Chattem
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its ongoing acquisition strategy, Pfizer bought biotech firm
   <company id="138693">
    Rinat Neuroscience
   </company>
   , which was developing drugs for pain, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurological disorders, in 2006. Pfizer also acquired vaccine technology firm
   <company id="135838">
    PowderMed
   </company>
   that year, and it spent $1.4 billion acquiring
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi
   </company>
   's joint rights to inhaled insulin drug Exubera. (Pfizer dropped Exubera from its product list in late 2007, however, due to lukewarm response from physicians and patients. The company took a $2.8 billion charge as a result.)
