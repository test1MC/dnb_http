   Once upon a time, a company grew up to become one of the world's leading children's book publishers. Scholastic Corporation sells books to children in more than 150 countries. It operates through three divisions: Children's Book Publishing and Distribution; Education; and International. Scholastic owns the rights to properties such as
   <em>
    Goosebumps
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    The Baby-Sitters Club
   </em>
   and is the US distributor of the
   <em>
    Harry Potter
   </em>
   books, the best-selling children's series of all time. Known for its school book fairs, Scholastic also publishes magazines, textbooks, and software for students and teachers, and produces children's TV shows.

  <p>
   The company generates about 25% of sales outside of the US. Scholastic has long-established operations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK, with newer holdings in China, India, and Ireland. Going forward, Scholastic expects to see strong growth in Asia and improved results in the UK.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Scholastic's revenues increased by about 5% in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year, while the company's net income was up $250 million to nearly $295 million in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The company's revenue and net income increased mainly due to increases in the book clubs and book fairs channels of the Children's Book Publishing and Distribution segment combined with the higher revenues driven by changes in marketing strategies.

  <p>
   Scholastic expects growth to be driven by new technology. Television has been a particular area of focus for Scholastic. The company has a partnership with
   <company id="47376">
    NBC
   </company>
   and
   <company id="43678">
    Telemundo
   </company>
   (along with other content and broadcasting companies) to produce and distribute television for children through a venture called Qubo. Spots reinforcing the importance of books and reading play throughout the Qubo programming block, which airs on NBC and Telemundo in English and Spanish.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Scholastic agreed to sell its Educational Technology and Services business to
   <company id="10630">
    Houghton Mifflin Harcourt
   </company>
   for $575 million in cash.

  <p>
   Fresh from a stint on his college newspaper, Maurice Robinson returned to his hometown of Wilkinson, Pennsylvania, in 1920 and launched
   <i>
    The Western Pennsylvania Scholastic,
   </i>
   a newspaper geared toward high school students. By 1922 its circulation had grown to 4,000 -- prompting Robinson to incorporate his business as Scholastic Publishing Company and launch
   <i>
    Scholastic,
   </i>
   a national version of the newspaper.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Depression found the unprofitable Scholastic struggling to improve its financial picture. In 1932 the company changed its name to Scholastic Corporation. A cost-cutting program helped it achieve a profit for the first time four years later. Profitability, however, would be fleeting: Accusations that Scholastic's publications promoted Communism prompted some schools to ban them.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWII paper rationing compelled Scholastic to print slimmer publications and turn away subscribers. Following the war the company introduced a string of publications and initiated a sales push that permitted it to pay its first dividend in 1951. In the 1950s, while weathering another spate of accusations that the company had Communist leanings, Scholastic continued to expand its list of publications. The company also created two book clubs that decade, launching what would become one of its most successful endeavors.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1960s Scholastic broadened its interests to include instructional materials and hardcover books. The company went public in 1969 and continued its expansion during the 1970s with ventures into record production and filmstrips. In 1974 Maurice's son Richard was appointed president.
  </p>
  <p>
   Scholastic began producing educational software and TV programming during the 1980s. In 1987 Richard took the company private again in order to help it regain financial stability. His timing was fortuitous -- the children's book market was on an upswing, and by the time he took Scholastic public again in 1992, the company's book sales had doubled.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1992 launch of its
   <i>
    Goosebumps
   </i>
   books initially met with great success. But by 1996, when kids had grown weary of
   <i>
    Goosebumps,
   </i>
   book returns caused profits to take a nosedive. Robinson responded by instituting cost-cutting and layoffs, and Scholastic divested itself of products not associated with its core business. The company continued to expand its TV and film interests during the 1990s, producing TV shows such as
   <i>
    Scholastic's The Magic School Bus
   </i>
   and feature films such as
   <i>
    The Indian in the Cupboard
   </i>
   for worldwide audiences.
  </p>
  <p>
   Scholastic created a new publishing unit to issue professional and parenting magazines in 1998. Also that year it released the first
   <i>
    Harry Potter
   </i>
   book by then-unknown British author J.K. Rowling for distribution in the US.  The Potter books eventually broke sales records to become the best-selling children's series of all time. In addition, the company inked a deal with
   <company id="123040">
    Warner Brothers Worldwide Publishing
   </company>
   to create children's books based on Warner Brothers' movie and TV properties. The following year it relaunched its six-year-old subscription-based Internet site as a free site for teachers, kids, and parents.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Scholastic published the fourth book in the
   <i>
    Harry Potter
   </i>
   series,
   <em>
    Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
   </em>
   , which had the largest first printing in history (later bested by other books in the series). Later that year it purchased children's book and reference publisher Grolier from
   <company id="41009">
    Lagard√©re
   </company>
   for $400 million. (It later changed Grolier's name to Scholastic Library Publishing.) The following year Scholastic announced that it would establish shops in Toys "R" Us stores to sell toys and games. In 2001 the company also bought the assets of book fair company Troll Book Fairs Inc. It also bought educational software maker Tom Snyder Productions and animated TV producer Soup2Nuts; both are units of
   <company id="54409">
    Torstar
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company made a public debt offering in 2002 of some $300 million in order to help offset debts incurred with its purchase of Grolier. That year it also acquired Klutz, a maker of children's products and books, from
   <company id="100896">
    Corus Entertainment
   </company>
   and bought a 15% interest in The Book People, a UK book distributor. In addition, Scholastic acquired Teacher's Friend Publications, a maker of classroom decorations, for $6 million. Citing poor industry conditions, Scholastic cut about 400 employees (about 4% of the workforce) in 2003. Also that year Scholastic paid close to $10 million for the rights to the popular spooky kids' series
   <i>
    Goosebumps
   </i>
   by R.L. Stine.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the last book in the
   <em>
    Harry Potter
   </em>
   series,
   <em>
    Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
   </em>
   , set sales records after 8.3 million copies vanished from shelves in 24 hours, ousting the previous record set in 2005 by
   <em>
    Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   Scholastic next faced a challenging period, when the economic downturn caused a decrease in spending among families and school districts. As a result, the company cut costs by reducing salaries, offering a voluntary retirement program, freezing hiring, and reducing costs for paper, printing, and postage. Scholastic also increased the price of children's books in select categories.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired education magazine publisher Weekly Reader in 2012.
