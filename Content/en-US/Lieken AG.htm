   Lieken AG is the breadbasket of Germany. Through its Lieken Brot-und Backwaren operation, the company supplies about 18,000 retail food outlets with fresh bread and bakery under the Golden Toast and Lieken Urkorn brand names. It operates about 15 baking plants throughout the country. In 2010, Lieken's parent company and Italy's largest pasta maker
   <company id="91684">
    Barilla
   </company>
   sold Lieken's Kamps operations to private investment firm ECM Equity Capital Management, also located in Germany. Kamps operates some 900 retail bakery shops in Germany. The sale marked Barilla and Lieken's exit from the bake-shop sector.

   Heiner Kamps opened his first store in 1982 in Dusseldorf, Germany. By 1992 Kamps ran 23 craft bakeries in Germany with sales of about $15 million. That year US food giant Borden, Inc., bought Kamps. Borden integrated the business into its Wilhelm Weber GmbH unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 Borden sold Wilhelm Weber to Wendeln Group, which in turn sold Wilhelm Weber's retail assets to Kamps and a group of private investors. Originally called BBG Backerei Beteiligungsgesellschaft, the company was renamed Kamps AG in 1997. The next year it went public with about 620 outlets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kamps then carved out more thick slices of the European bakery market. It acquired Dutch baked foods leader Bakker Bart Food Group in 1999 and became Germany's largest bakery firm when it bought rival Wendeln Group, which supplied more than 27,000 food retailers. In 2000 Kamps acquired a 49% stake in French industrial baker Harry's and announced that it would take public subsidiary Bakerstreet (which sold through gas stations) by 2003. Kamps sold Bakerstreet, however, in 2001.

  <p>
   After Italian pasta giant
   <company id="91684">
    Barilla
   </company>
   acquired Kamps in 2002, it kept the company's existing management and operated the company separately from its other baking, pasta, and food businesses. In order to reduce debt, in 2003 Kamps sold off its interest in Harry's in that same year, and the following year, it sold its Dan Cake Group.
