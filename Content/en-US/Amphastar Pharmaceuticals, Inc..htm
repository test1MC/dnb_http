   Amphastar Pharmaceuticals wants to be a star in the niche drug firmament. The company makes specialty and branded generic drugs in injectable, topical, and inhalant forms. Using its proprietary delivery systems, the company focuses on drugs that are difficult to manufacture or can be improved with new delivery methods. Amphastar's 15 products include Amphadase (increases absorption and dispersion of injected drugs), Cortrosyn (tests for adrenal gland disorders), and Naloxone (reverses the effects of opioids like painkillers and other narcotics). It also manufactures the branded asthma drug Primatene Mist, which is sold over the counter, and has about a dozen generics in its pipeline. Amphastar was formed in 1996 and went public in 2014.

  <p>
   After filing and withdrawing in 2005, Amphastar tried again in 2014. It raised $56 million, about half the amount it initially estimated, which it will use for product development and possible future acquisitions.

   With about 15 drugs on the commercial market, Amphastar manufactures and develops many of its products through subsidiaries Armstrong Pharmaceuticals and International Medication Systems (IMS). The company's Massachusetts-based Armstrong Pharmaceuticals subsidiary focuses on manufacturing metered dose inhalers used to administer respiratory drugs for asthma and obstructive pulmonary disease. The company is also developing 13 generic and seven branded injectable and inhalation candidates.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its California-based IMS systems subsidiary, on the other hand, makes pre-filled syringes, safety syringes, and vials that are filled with injectable and topical drugs. Its products range from Vitamin K administered to newborn babies to lidocaine (a local anesthetic) used in emergency medicine. The Luer-Jet emergency syringe uses a needleless delivery system to prevent accidental needle sticks.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the company also offers contract manufacturing services that include labeling and packaging, and aseptic filling.
  </p>
  <p>
   Enoxaparin sodium, the generic equivalent of Sanofi's blood thinner Lovenox, is the company's largest revenue producer at 60% of the total.

   The company sells its products through group purchasing organizations and via drug wholesalers, who then deliver the products to end-users. It also sells through specialty distributors, wholesalers, and retailers. Amphastar's top four customers account for about 90% of sales with specialty pharma firm

   bringing in a full 35% on its own.

   In 2013 revenue increased by 12% to $230 million due to increased sales volume, especially on sales of enoxaparin. Net income, however, plummeted 24% from $18 to $12 million as production costs for enoxaparin rose due to the increased volume. R&amp;D costs also rose as the company focused on developing its pipeline. Cash from operations improved from negative $2 million to positive $31 million due to net income, depreciation, and deferred taxes.

  <p>
   Amphastar is engaged in the development of new proprietary pharmaceuticals, as well as generic drugs, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), and drug delivery systems. It targets difficult to produce items (such as emulsions and suspensions), which typically have fewer competitors. It also focuses on developing versions of drugs with a significant market share or new offerings within a unique niche, as well as established products that can be enhanced through new delivery systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also works to increase market shares of its existing product offerings, especially enoxaparin. While it focuses on developing and marketing its own pipeline of products, Amphastar does, from time to time, partner with other drug makers through both in-licensing and out-licensing agreements.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep up with the growing Chinese market, Amphastar is spending about $40 million to expand its production facilities there.
