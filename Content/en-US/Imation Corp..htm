   Imation is off to a fresh start. The company focuses on its lines of Nexsan and Connected Data memory system after it divested the previously well-known magnetic tape brand Memorex and other assets. With its restructured product portfolio, Imation is aiming at the corporate and government markets for hard disk drive, flash storage and data retrieval systems with products for hybrid and private cloud setups. The Connected Data lineup has product for medium-sized businesses. About 40% of Imation's sales are to customers in the US. Japan has been its biggest single market overseas.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Around 61% of Imation's sales come from customers outside the US. Sales to customers in Japan account for nearly 24% of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has facilities in more than 35 countries worldwide, and to keep costs down, it solely relies on contract manufacturers in Asia to make its products.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Imation sells its products through distributors, wholesalers, resellers, OEMs, and retail outlets worldwide in more than 100 countries. About 28% of sales come from retailers, 68% from distributors, and 4% from OEMs. The company's products have been sold to businesses and consumers.

  <p>
   Imation's revenue has fallen steadily in the past seven years with a 27% drop from 2014 to 2015 when it recorded $529 million in sales. Much of the 2015 decrease came from the wind down of Imation's Memorex and RDX product lines. But the company's ongoing Nexsan business suffered as well as Imation restructured the business.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's loss widened to $194 million in 2015 from $115 million in 2014 on the lower sales, compounded by impairment and restructuring costs. Imation hasn't turned a profit since 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   Negative cash flow for Imation increased to $17.8 million in 2015 from $7.8 million in 2014.

  <p>
   Imation made major changes in 2015, dropping its consumer-oriented and commercial magnetic tape businesses and cutting corporate costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its housecleaning, the company sold its Memorex trademark and corresponding trademark licenses in 2016 for $9.4 million. It also sold the IronKey business to
   <company id="41131">
    Kingston Digital
   </company>
   and DataLocker for $4.7 million. Besides trademarks and technologies, Imation also sold its corporate headquarters facility in Oakdale, Minnesota for $11.5 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The restructuring, which was to cost about $120 million, came after continued losses Imation's legacy businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the asset sale and restructuring, Imation's sole business will be its Nexsan and Connected Data storage systems for commercial users. The company's portfolio ranges from high volume, dense storage products to unified hybrid storage solutions for small and medium commercial businesses, enterprise, and government customers. The company counts more than 11,000 Nexsan customers worldwide with more than 38,000 systems deployed since 1999. Imation acquired Nexsan in 2012 for $115 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Imation acquired Connected Data Inc., private cloud sync and share company, for $6.7 million. The acquisition bolstered Imation's storage strategy.
  </p>
  <p>
   The new strategy puts Imation in competition with companies who have supplied storage systems to enterprises for a long time. They include

    EMC
   </company>
   and
   <company id="47100">

   </company>
   . But Imation faces a new crop of competitors that have grown by supplying flash storage systems and even cloud based storage systems. Those companies include

  <p>
   Imation's ancestry stretches back to 1902, when five businessmen founded Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (
   <company id="11003">
    3M
   </company>
   ) in Two Harbors, Minnesota, to sell corundum to manufacturers for grinding wheels. Faced with stiff competition and the realization that its mining holdings contained the nearly worthless igneous rock anorthosite instead of corundum, the company shifted gears and began making sandpaper and abrasive wheels.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a research-fueled corporate culture, 3M's engineers thrived, launching a long line of culturally implanted products including Scotch masking tape, the dry-printing photocopy process, Post-it adhesive notepads, and, in 1947, the first commercially viable magnetic recording tape. This ancestor of the cassette tape would mark 3M's leap into the business that later helped make Imation.
  </p>
  <p>
   The genesis of Imation's other lines continued in the 1950s and 1960s when 3M ventured into photographic products. It jumped into color proofing systems and X-ray and other medical imaging technologies in the 1970s. When its diskette manufacturing business faced intense global competition in the 1980s, 3M expanded its efforts in the data storage products market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Imation -- a name taken from the words "imaging" and "information" -- was born in 1996 when 3M spun off its low-performing data storage, imaging, and printing businesses. The move was part of a broader 3M reorganization that saw it retain its industrial and consumer and life science units, while discontinuing its audio- and videotape business. About 75% of 3M's data storage and medical imaging employees made the move; the rest opted for early retirement. That year William Monahan, who began his career in the early 1970s selling 3M data storage products on Wall Street and rose to serve as VP of the company's Electro and Communication Group, was named chairman and CEO.
