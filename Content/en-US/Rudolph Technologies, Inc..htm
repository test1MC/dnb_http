   Rudolph Technologies' inspection and metrology systems lead the way to better yields for chip makers. To create semiconductors, manufacturers deposit precise layers of conducting and insulating materials on silicon wafers. Rudolph's process control metrology equipment monitors these layers to ensure that the material doesn't get too thick or too thin. Its inspection equipment (around half of sales) looks for defects not obvious to the human eye, such as tiny scratches or gouges in the surface of a silicon wafer. The company also makes a range of data analysis and process control software. Rudolph gets about two-thirds of sales from customers outside the US.

  <p>
   Inspection and metrology make up the biggest part of Rudolph's revenue, about 63% combined. The company's data analysis and review business accounts for 13% of revenue with parts and service accounting for 18%. About 6% of revenue comes from its small lithography business.

  <p>
   Rudolph sells its products to semiconductor makers in 20 countries. US-based semiconductor companies account for 34% of the company's revenue, followed by Taiwan, 27%; Singapore, 10%; and several countries with smaller percentages. Purchases from Asian manufacturers are 65% of revenue.

  <p>
   The company deploys a direct sales, customer service, and application support staff in offices in the US, Europe and Asia. Although Intel and STATS ChiPac Ltd. each accounted for more than 10% of Rudolph's sales in 2013, no customers had that distinction in 2014. Other customers have included

  <p>
   Rudolph's revenue increased 3% to $181.2 million in 2014 from $176.2 million in 2013. A rise in capital spending by back-end semiconductor manufacturers, chiefly Rudolph's customers in advanced packaging boosted sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company posted a net loss of $4.6 million in 2014 compared to net income of $3.5 million in 2013. The loss came from higher higher selling, general, and administrative expenses. The expenses were inflated by litigation expenses for final judgment awarded to Integrated Technology Corporation as well as higher share-based compensation expenses and restructuring charges.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations decreased to $4.3 million in 2014 from $6.1 million in 2013.

  <p>
   Rudolph maintains a variety of businesses related to semiconductor manufacturing to mitigate the impact of the cyclical nature of the industry and generate cash flow during downturns. Its lithography business is one way the company takes pressure off the main inspection and metrology businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company restructured in 2014, reducing its headcount 9% and closing a manufacturing facility in Mainz, Germany. The operations of the Mainz plant were moved to Rudolph facilities in Snoqualmie, Washington, and Bloomington, Minnesota.

  <p>
   Rudolph purchased Stella Alliance, a Massachusetts-based semiconductor inspection technology intellectual property portfolio company, in 2015. Stella Alliance owns patented illumination, auto-focus and image acquisition technology that enhances inspection techniques. The acquisition is to result in a new high-resolution inspection system from Rudolph in the second quarter of 2016. The acquired technology also extends Rudolph's inspection portfolio into growing unserved segments of microelectronic device manufacturing.
