   Orion Energy Systems wants customers to see the light ... high intensity fluorescent (HIF) lighting systems, that is. Orion designs, manufactures, and installs energy management systems that include HIF lighting and intelligent lighting controls. Its Apollo Light Pipe product collects and focuses daylight, without consuming electricity. The firm estimates its HIF lineup can help cut customers' lighting-related electricity costs by up to 50%, boost quantity and quality of light, and reduce related carbon-dioxide emissions. In addition, its engineered systems division makes solar photovoltaic products that allow customers to convert sunlight into electricity.

  <p>
   Operating majorly in North America, the company has its manufacturing unit and a technology center located in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, and office properties in Green Cove Springs, Florida; and Jacksonville, Florida.

  <p>
   Orion divides its operations across several segments. Energy management (almost 75% of total sales) supplies its HIF lighting systems, while the engineered systems division makes solar and wind alternative renewable energy systems (primarily solar photovoltaic systems). In mid-2014, the company restructured its business and added a new division -- US markets -- which includes the US operations of its Orion engineered systems and Orion distribution services.

  <p>
   The company sells its products and services indirectly to customers through electrical contractors or distributors. Orion also sells its products on a wholesale basis to electrical contractors and value-added resellers. (About 60% of its total lighting revenue comes from its reseller network.) As such, its sales strategy involves building upon these customer relationships with these electrical contractors and value-added resellers to widen the geographic scope of its sales reach.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2014 Orion's revenues climbed by 3% to $89 million. The growth was due to an increase in service revenues fueled by high installations from a previous acquisition and a single landfill solar project installed during the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Orion has posted two straight years of net losses, mostly due to a bump in expenses related to acquisitions. In 2014 the company's operating cash flow increased to $10 million, due to an increase in accounts receivable attributed to decreased inventories and increased cash collections.

   Orion largely targets commercial and industrial customers who are kept awake at night trying to choose the right technology to reduce their business expenses. These customers call Orion for an energy "retrofit," or replacement of high-intensity discharge products with the company's HIF lighting system. The company is specifically targeting utilities and electrical grid operators for this type of need. It has been growing its LED offerings to customers to capitalize on the fast-growing LED trend in the lighting manufacturing industry. While still predominantly a HIF and solar lighting company, Orion has joined

   ,

    Revolution Lighting
   </company>
   , and several other lighting manufacturers offering LED lighting and systems to customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Orion capitalizes on its customers' existing electrical contractor to deliver installation and monitoring services, as well as sells its products wholesale to electrical contractors and resellers. Wholesale channels are a promising route to market and have grown to about 60% of the company's revenue.

   Expanding its product portfolio, in 2013 Orion acquired Florida-based Harris Manufacturing, Inc. and Harris LED, LLC. for $10 million. Harris engineers, designs, sources, and makes energy-efficient lighting systems, including fluorescent and LED lighting, and day-lighting products.
