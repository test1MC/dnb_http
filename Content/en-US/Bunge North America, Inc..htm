In addition to corn, BNA also deals in soybeans, canola, wheat, rice, and sorghum. Its grain division stores the oilseed crops; its processing division operates oilseed-processing plants in US and Canada. Its crusher/refiner facility in Iowa is the one of the largest oil-extraction lines in the US. BNA's oil division blends and sells edible oil to food manufacturers, food service operators, and retail food outlets throughout the US and Canada. BNA is the North American arm of

    Bunge Limited
   </company>
   , BNA is a vertically integrated food and feed ingredient company which supplies raw and processed agricultural commodities and specialized food ingredients to a wide range of customers in the animal feed, food processor, and foodservice and bakery industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its agriculture commodities segment operates more than 80 grain elevators connected by a fleet of barges, ensuring transportation flexibility and on-time delivery and export quality products from four corridors strategically located in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada; Brunswick, Georgia; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Longview, Washington.

  <p>
   In 2015 BNA strengthened its cooking oil business with the acquisition of
   <company id="113416">
    Whole Harvest Foods
   </company>
   , a refiner and packager of expeller pressed commercial cooking oil. Whole Harvest Foods products include frying oils, pan sprays, and liquid butter alternatives, which are made at a refinery and packaging facility in Warsaw, North Carolina, and its packaging plant in Las Vegas, Nevada.
  </p>
  <p>
   In another 2015 acquisition BNA bought Heartland Harvest, a producer of die cut pellets used to make extruded foods. BNA can expand its products with Heartland Harvest facility's capability to use starches such as ancient grains and sweet potatoes as well as corn, rice, and potatoes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Further strengthening its core food and ingredients segment, in 2014 the company acquired Corn Flour Producers, LLC (which operates one plant in Worthington, Ind., and mills a wide variety of premium corn masa flours used in the production of tortillas and corn chips).

  <p>
   In 2006 Bunge was ordered by the
   <company id="150279">
    federal government
   </company>
   to pay almost $14 million in fines for air pollution violations at 12 of its processing plants. In an unrelated move, when Bunge expanded its partnership with
   <company id="105170">
    DuPont Agriculture &amp; Nutrition
   </company>
   to include industrial applications that year, Bunge renamed its line of soy products Treus.
  </p>
  <p>
   With backing from an alternative-fuels investment group Biodiesel Investment, also in 2006, the company was able to build a biodiesel plant in Illinois with a 45-million-gallon-per-year capacity.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company closed its corn mill in Chatham, Ontario, in 2007 due to its age and size. Operations were moved to its Danville, Illinois; Atchison, Kansas; and Crete, Nebraska, facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 BNA announced it was merging with rival
   <company id="55621">
    Corn Products International
   </company>
   (since renamed Ingredion); however, Corn Products' board refused to agree to the merger, and the plan was scuttled. Under terms of the agreement, Corn Products was required to pay up to $10 million toward the expenses BNA incurred in connection with the merger. Later in 2008 BNA acquired the corn dry mill operations of J.R. Short Milling.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2009 the company bought the assets of New Jersey-based Mid-Atlantic Vegetable Shortening to expand its operations. Mid-Atlantic packages liquid oils, shortenings, margarines, and butter blends for customers in the bakery food processing and foodservice sectors in the northeastern US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2010 BNA acquired Morristown Grain Co., which operates elevators in Morristown and Rushville, Indiana. The two facilities have a combined storage capacity of more than 6 million bushels.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2010 BNA entered the rice milling niche of the industry through its purchase of
   <company id="116278">
    Pacific International Rice Mills
   </company>
   , a US maker of milled rice in bulk and packaged form. The company sells it products in domestic and export markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Building upon its oils business, BNA acquired a pair of margarine production facilities and related assets from The
   <company id="110228">
    C.F. Sauer Company
   </company>
   in 2011. The purchase expanded BNA's selection of low saturated and trans-fat products. The plants, located in Kansas and Virginia, can roll out up to 400 million pounds of margarine annually, and the margarine can be packaged in a range of sizes, from 5-gram portion cups for restaurants to 1-ton totes for food processors. BNA continues to operate the Virginia facility, however, it intends to eventually transition margarine production from Kansas to other locations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through an agreement with the SCF Marine subsidiary of
   <company id="13535">
    SEACOR Holdings
   </company>
   , BNA formed a joint venture in 2011. Named Bunge-SCF Grain, the venture operates from a facility at the northernmost point of the Mississippi River that has the capacity to ship and receive grains, soybeans, and their byproducts. BNA has locations in more than 15 US states, five Canadian provinces, and in Mexico City. Its US elevators are mainly located along the Mississippi River and its tributaries, where it operates its own fleet of barges.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company purchased the Lotus elevator in Rushville, Indiana from MGPI of Indiana, LLC, which is located in a key agricultural production region of southeast Indiana. The elevator has a storage capacity of one million bushels and is used primarily to store corn.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash, in late 2012 BNA sold its interest in its fertilizer joint venture, B-G Fertilizer, to its partner
   <company id="40189">
    GROWMARK, Inc.
   </company>
