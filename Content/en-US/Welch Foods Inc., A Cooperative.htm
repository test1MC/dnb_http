   Welch Foods and National Grape Cooperative regularly introduce new juices and grape-based products, and in 2015 stated it was "committed to research and development that will meet the growing demand for products that address consumers' health and nutrition needs." During 2014, it increased investment in its successful Bottled 100% Juice line and launched Farmer's Pick, a new 100% Juice line featuring unfiltered juice. In mid-2012, the coop launched four new flavors (lemonade, strawberry lemonade, raspberry limeade, and mango) of its sparkling juice cocktails, resulting in a 29% increase in volume during the summer months and market share gain during the holiday season. Welch Foods low-growth spreads business got a boost in 2012 with the launch of Welch's Nautrals, an all natural, no high fructose corn syrup formation that resonated with consumers.

   The co-op has also been making investments in efficiency to cut its overhead costs and boost proceeds for future growth. Its 2014 upgrade of its Sparkling line capacity and capabilities reduced material costs, shortened lead teams, eliminated waste, and reduced overall costs by some $2 million per year. The new production line also doubled its processing speeds to up to 270 bottles per minute and introduced a new, more efficient case configuration that allowed for more and better displays in retail stores.
