   Young Innovations makes dentists' hands taste better. The company makes many of the dental instruments and supplies used during your six-month cleaning and check up: flavored examination gloves, prophylactic angles, cups, brushes, pastes, drills, cleaning systems, and X-ray equipment sold under brand names like Panoramic, Young Dental, and Denticator. The company even markets the little bags filled with oral care goodies given to patients. It works primarily with distributors, but also sells its products directly to dental schools, military bases, and VA health care facilities. More than 80% of its sales are in the US. In 2013 Young Innovations was taken private by Linden Capital Partners.

  <p>
   In January 2013 the health-care-focused private equity, Linden Capital Partners, acquired Young Innovations in a leveraged buyout deal worth some $314 million. Through the going private transaction, Young Innovations gained financial backing to help it grow its business. Prior to the deal, vice chairman George Richmond owned more than a quarter of the company.

  <p>
   Consumable products, including preventative, infection control, endodontic, microapplicator, and home care items, account for nearly 90% of sales. Diagnostic products include digital imaging and film x-ray systems, which are available for sale or rental.

   The company has seen increased sales in both its consumable and diagnostic product lines, partially due to expansion efforts in those areas. Young Innovations pursues internal development by creating new offerings and by evolving and enhancing its existing products. For instance, it added a new digital panoramic x-ray system to its diagnostic offerings in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the company aims to expand by strengthening existing customer relationships and gaining new customers in extended markets. It is also working to reduce operational expenses by increasing efficiencies in its business.
