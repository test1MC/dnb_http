   AOL is still serving America online. The Web portal serves users with an array of content and communication tools, including sites for news (
   <company id="160991">
    TheHuffingtonPost.com
   </company>
   ), maps (
   <company id="53856">
    MapQuest
   </company>
   ), entertainment (Moviephone), local information (Patch), and technology (Engadget and TechCrunch). AOL primarily earns revenues through display, search, and contextual advertising (

    AOL Advertising

   ) sales. It sells ads on AOL Properties as well as its Third Party Network (third-party sites). Search is provided through a deal with
   <company id="59101">
    Google
   </company>
   . AOL still offers dial-up Internet access to 2.2 million subscribers in the US. In 2009 Time Warner spun off AOL to shareholders. In 2015
   <company id="10197">
    Verizon

   AOL's business strategy is focuses on showcasing original, advertising-supported content. Google powers AOL searches through a partnership that extends through 2015. As part of the agreement, Google also provides AOL with mobile search, and brings AOL's video content to Google's

   Stephen Case was developing new pizzas for
   <company id="89521">
    Pizza Hut
   </company>
   in the early 1980s when he began using an online service called The Source. Believing the technology had possibilities, he took a marketing job in 1983 with Control Video, which ran an online service for users of Atari computer games. When Control Video ran into trouble, Case helped the new CEO, Jim Kimsey, raise money (venture capitalist Alan Patricof was among the investors). In 1985 the company, rechristened Quantum Computer Services, launched the Q-Link online service. Four years later it unveiled a nationwide service called America Online and in 1991 the company took the moniker as its new name.
  </p>
  <p>
   America Online went public in 1992 and Case became CEO the next year. The company spent heavily on marketing in an effort to pass rivals
   <company id="42473">
    Prodigy
   </company>
   and CompuServe and unveiled a Windows-based version of its online software that year. Early investor and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen sold his 24.9% stake in America Online in 1994 when the company denied him a seat on its board. That year it bought browser software maker Booklink Technologies. Before the end of the year, more than 1 million people subscribed to the AOL service.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 America Online teamed with
   <company id="40661">
    Bertelsmann
   </company>
   to form AOL Europe. The following year it created subsidiary AOL Canada and partnered with
   <company id="56032">
    Mitsui
   </company>
   and Nikkei to launch AOL Japan. Also in 1996 America Online began charging a flat rate for its AOL service; subscriptions exploded but the added traffic clogged the company's network. Bob Pittman (founder of
   <company id="101156">
    MTV
   </company>
   ) was appointed president and COO the next year and scaled back the company's marketing campaign to focus on solving its network problems. In 1998 America Online sold its network services operations to WorldCom in exchange for CompuServe's online services division and $147 million in cash. The company continued expanding internationally, forming
   <company id="99787">
    America Online Latin America
   </company>
   with the
   <company id="52394">
    Cisneros Group
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 America Online acquired Web browser maker
   <company id="42472">
    Netscape Communications
   </company>
   for about $10 billion. The deal fortified its joint venture with
   <company id="14833">
    Sun Microsystems
   </company>
   , through which the two companies agreed to develop enterprise software. The company also invested $800 million in
   <company id="16706">
    Gateway
   </company>
   as part of a joint-marketing pact and agreed to launch a co-branded Internet service with Wal-Mart.
  </p>
  <p>
   The deal of the century came in early 2000 when America Online announced it would acquire media giant Time Warner. After a year of regulatory scrutiny, the $106 billion deal closed in 2001, creating AOL Time Warner. Case became chairman of the new company, while America Online became a division led by Barry Schuler, formerly president of the Interactive Services Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year America Online agreed to purchase Bertelsmann's 50% stake in AOL Europe and formed a joint venture with computer maker Legend Group Limited (later re-named
   <company id="56726">
    Lenovo Group Limited
   </company>
   ) to develop online services in China. America Online invested about $100 million in
   <company id="51493">
    Amazon.com
   </company>
   as the companies expanded their marketing relationship.
  </p>
  <p>
   Post-merger, the America Online division showed a slowdown in revenue because of fewer ad dollars earned and slower subscriber growth. As a result, in 2001 America Online embarked on a reorganization that included tighter integration of its numerous interactive services and about 1,700 job cuts. It terminated its Sun Microsystems joint venture, iPlanet, as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 AOL Time Warner filed an antitrust suit against
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   alleging that the software giant unfairly crushed Netscape with its Internet Explorer offering. Also in 2002 Schuler left America Online to head a new digital products development venture for parent AOL Time Warner. He was replaced by AOL Time Warner COO Robert Pittman, who resigned under pressure only months after he was sent to help lead the company's recovery. Pittman was then replaced by Jon Miller, previously a top executive at USA Interactive (now
   <company id="52963">
    InterActiveCorp
   </company>
   ) who oversaw a corporate reorganization.
  </p>
  <p>
   Amidst shareholders' criticism of the merged parent company's performance, Case (widely regarded as the merger's chief architect and proponent) resigned as chairman of the parent company in early 2003. Later that year Microsoft and AOL Time Warner settled their anti-trust suit; Microsoft agreed to pay AOL Time Warner $750 million. Months later the parent company dropped the three letters "AOL" from its name to become
   <company id="102518">
    Time Warner
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In the wake of an industry-wide downturn marked by the dot-com crash, a decline in subscribers and ad sales, and increased competition from other broadband operators and low-price dial-up services, AOL faced questions about its accounting practices and about advertising deals with smaller Internet firms in which AOL may have exaggerated accounts of its own growth. Time Warner agreed to pay $510 million to cover the cost of settling the related SEC and Justice Department investigations.
  </p>
  <p>
   AOL began looking to expand its online advertising services business in 2004 when it acquired Advertising.com for $435 million. The following year it snatched up
   <company id="136566">
    Weblogs
   </company>
   , an early pioneer in monetizing the blog phenomenon. Continued erosion of Internet access subscribers led AOL to announce that year a new business model focused on advertising-supported content. The reorganization led to more than 5,000 job losses. Late that year Internet search leader
   <company id="59101">
    Google
   </company>
   acquired a 5% stake in AOL for $1 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2006 AOL began to dispose of its international dial-up services operations. The company sold its business in Germany to
   <company id="42394">
    Telecom Italia
   </company>
   for $856 million, and
   <company id="147421">
    Neuf Cetegel
   </company>
   acquired AOL France for $368 million.
   <company id="128633">
    NBCUniversal
   </company>
   executive Randy Falco replaced Miller as chairman and CEO that year. The company sold its UK access service business to
   <company id="101162">
    Carphone Warehouse
   </company>
   in 2007 for $690 million. Also that year it acquired search marketing firm
   <company id="136241">
    Quigo Technologies
   </company>
   . The company acquired social networking site Bebo in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   AOL faced an investigation for allegedly inflating revenues during its merger with Time Warner, and the SEC eventually charged eight former AOL executives with fraud. US regulators completed its investigation of AOL in 2008. The following year Time Warner bought back Google's 5% stake in AOL in order to prepare the a spinoff of AOL. Google had purchased the stake in 2005 for $1 billion, and in 2009 sold it back to Time Warner for $283 million. Also that year Tim Armstrong succeeded Falco as head of AOL.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2009 Time Warner undid its failed 2001 merger with AOL, worth some $124 billion at the time. Its move to become an independent, publicly traded company valued AOL at less than $3 billion, proving what had long been apparent -- that the AOL-Time Warner combination was arguably one of the most disastrous corporate mergers in history. After the separation, the company embarked on a massive restructuring under the leadership of CEO Tim Armstrong.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of the restructuring AOL cut one-third of its workforce, or about 2,500 jobs, and renewed its business strategy on showcasing original, advertising-supported content. Also as part of its transformation, AOL exited most of its international markets, launched a redesigned home page, and acquired several assets. Acquisitions included local online media firm Patch Media, a provider of local information and services for towns and communities, for $7 million, and technology blog TechCrunch.
  </p>
  <p>
   Signifying its failed attempt at social networking, AOL sold social networking site
   <company id="159519">
    Bebo
   </company>
   in 2010 to turnaround specialist Criterion Capital Partners LLC. AOL had purchased the company in 2008 for $850 million in order to compete with market leaders
   <company id="148344">
    Facebook
   </company>
   and
   <company id="148345">
    Myspace
   </company>
   . Bebo had been popular in the UK, but AOL was unable to grow its traffic in the US. While the sale price was undisclosed, reports surfaced of Bebo's 2010 value represented "a small fraction" of what AOL paid in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to that divestiture, AOL offloaded its instant messaging service ICQ in 2010. It sold the business to Russian Internet investment firm Digital Sky Technologies for some $188 million. AOL had been hoping to attract some $300 million for the popular platform, which had more than 40 million global users.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2010 AOL extended its search agreement with Google to run through 2015. In further attempts to expand its original content, in 2011 AOL acquired TheHuffingtonPost.com for $315 million. As part of the deal, AOL formed the Huffington Post Media Group to house the combined company's content and local businesses. After the deal closed, AOL cut about 900 jobs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015
   <company id="10197">
    Verizon
   </company>
   agreed to purchase AOL and make it a wholly owned subsidiary.
