   Cardinal Glass manufactures residential glass for windows and doors. It caters to domestic and international markets through five operating units: Cardinal CG (coated glass and optical mirrors), Cardinal FG (float and tempered glass), Cardinal IG (insulating glass), Cardinal LG (laminated glass), and Cardinal ST (solar technologies). Its value-added panels include self-cleaning coated "neat glass," smooth enough to loosen dirt and enable water to sheet off, and "LoE3," designed to cut solar heat gain. Cardinal Glass began in Minneapolis in 1962.
