   Even a giant company like
   <company id="41889">
    Toyota Motor
   </company>
   can use a helping hand from time to time. Toyota Auto Body puts together bodies for passenger cars such as the Prius, as well as commercial, recreational, and special-purpose vehicles for its parent company, Toyota Motor. Toyota Auto Body also assembles minivans, compact trucks, and specially equipped vehicles. Most of its revenues come from the assembly of van bodies. The company has four plants and one development center in Japan, three in Indonesia and two in Thailand, and one each in Malaysia, Taiwan, and the US.
