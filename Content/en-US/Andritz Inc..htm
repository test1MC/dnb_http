   When it's time to break and process stuff into bits, Andritz Inc. makes a machine to move it along its way. The company is the US arm of Austria's
   <company id="110562">
    Andritz AG
   </company>
   . With more than 20 locations, the company supplies plant equipment for the pulp and paper and animal feed and bio-fuel industries. Its Sprout-Bauer and Durametal branded lineup of rotary valves, hammer mills, screeners, agitators, and other specialized machinery are used in feed and bio ethanol production, as well as in fiber and pulp (for paper products) and chemical recovery. The company also provides process equipment parts touted to reduce energy and wear better.

   The company's operations frequently get a boost from the acquisitions made by its parent company. In 2012 Andritz AG acquired Bricmont from Inductotherm Group. Bricmont is headquartered in Pittsburgh and has assets in China and India. It supplies furnace systems to the aluminum and steel industries. The deal enabled Andritz to further enlarge its product offerings in furnaces and also strengthen its presence in North America, China, and India.

   In the same year, the company acquired Allied Environmental Solutions, a supplier of air quality control systems for utilities and various power generating industries (fossil-fired power stations) across the country. The transaction strengthened Andritz Energy's flue gas cleaning portfolio as it entered the US market.
