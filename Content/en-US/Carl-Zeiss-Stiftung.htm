  <p>
   The Foundation was formed by German physicist, optometrist, and entrepreneur Ernst Abbe in 1889. Abbe, who along with Carl Zeiss and Otto Schott founded Carl Zeiss in 1846 and Schott in 1884, envisioned an engine that would drive research and development in the natural and engineering sciences, thereby enabling sustained, strategic development of Carl Zeiss and Schott. To this end, the foundation funds programs for budding scientists and university studies located in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate, and Thuringia, Germany. It receives dividend payments from both subsidiaries according to their respective financial strength.
