  <p>
   The company's revenues increased by 1% in fiscal 2015 due to an increase in food container and trade molding sales, partially offset by a drop in media and recycling container revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Coral Products reported net income of £0.2 million in fiscal 2015 (compared to a loss of £0.9 million a year earlier due to the absence of impairment loss recognized on tangible assets, intangible assets, and inventory).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's cash flow increased by 50% that year.

  <p>
   As part of this strategy, in 2015 the company took the initial step along this plan when it acquired certain injection molding, extrusion blow molding and injection blow molding plant and machinery from Neiman Packaging Limited.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Coral Products acquired Yorkshire-based Tatra Plastics Limited, for £2.5 million. Tatra makes injection molding products for the rail and telecoms.
