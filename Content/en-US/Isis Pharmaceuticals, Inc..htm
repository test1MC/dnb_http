   Ionis (formerly Isis) Pharmaceuticals is trying to make sense out of antisense. The biotech develops drugs based on its antisense technology, in which drugs attach themselves to strands of RNA in order to prevent them from producing disease-causing proteins; the hoped-for end result is a therapy that fights disease without harming healthy cells. Ionis has nearly 40 pipeline drugs under development in areas including cardiovascular, metabolic, and severe and rare diseases (including cancer and neurological disorders). Its lead product is the cholesterol-lowering drug Kynamro, which Ionis has licensed to
   <company id="13560">
    Genzyme
   </company>
   ; it is marketed in the US and other countries for the treatment of genetic disorder homzygous FH.

  <p>
   In 2015, then-named Isis Pharmaceutical began operating in two segments -- Isis Core (previously named Drug Discovery and Development) and Akcea Therapeutics (formed to develop and commercialize lipid drugs).
  </p>
  <p>
   While it is developing drugs to address a wide range of diseases, the company's core focus areas are cardiovascular and metabolic disease. The firm has collaborated with Genzyme (a unit of drugmaker
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi
   </company>
   ) on development of the late-stage candidate Kynamro (mipomersen) since 2008; Genzyme holds a 5% stake in Isis as a result. After receiving approval in 2013, the company began marketing Kynamro in the US; Genzyme is preparing the drug for various global markets.

   Ionis Pharmaceutical is also developing Volanesorsen, which it plans to market through subsidiary Akcea Therapeutics for the treatment of the rare genetic disease Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS). Its ISIS-APOCIIRx drug was also developed for the treatment of FCS.

   Ionis Pharmaceuticals has yet to establish a steady royalty stream from products successfully commercialized by its partners, and as such its revenue and income levels fluctuate due to its dependency on development milestone and licensing fee payments (which come at irregular intervals). After revenue dropped in 2011 and remained relatively flat the following year, the company saw 44% sales growth to $147 million in 2013. Revenue rose another 45% to $214 million in 2014, led by research and development income from Biogen, GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, and
   <company id="163173">
    Achaogen
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the growth seen in 2013 and 2014, the company has lost money over the past five years. It reported a $39 million loss in 2014, an improvement over the $60 million loss it took in 2013. This was due to the firm's higher revenue as well as gains on its investment in
   <company id="162868">
    Regulus Therapeutics
   </company>
   (which it co-founded in 2007). As of the end of 2014, the firm had an accumulated deficit of some $1 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations climbed dramatically in 2012 and 2013 but fell 90% to $6 million in 2014, primarily due to a change in deferred contract revenue.

  <p>
   Ionis Pharmaceuticals is focused on bringing its partnered drug candidates to commercialization stages, as well as on forming additional collaborative agreements on proprietary candidates in earlier stages of development. In 2014 it formed an alliance with AstraZeneca to develop novel delivery methods for antisense oligonucleotides; the following year it entered into a partnership with Janssen Biotech to develop antisense drugs for the treatment of autoimmune disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Also in 2015 the company licensed another antisense drug, ISIS-FXIRx, to Bayer Healthcare to develop for the prevention of thrombosis.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the company often licenses out development work on non-core pipeline candidates to smaller biotech partners, such as UK-based Atlantic Pharmaceuticals, that focus on specific disease areas, taking a small stake in the developer as part of the licensing agreements. Outside the antisense realm, the company has a joint venture called Regulus Therapeutics with
   <company id="119410">
    Alnylam Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   and Sanofi to discover and develop a separate but related class of RNA drugs called microRNA therapies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the company formed subsidiary Akcea Therapeutics to develop and commercialize drugs from its lipid franchise.

   The company's first and only successful antisense product came with the 1998 FDA approval of Vitravene, an ophthalmic drug it discovered and licensed to
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   . Novartis marketed the drug worldwide as a treatment for CMV retinitis, a common eye infection in AIDS patients. However, following the emergence of newer anti-HIV drugs and a decline in secondary infections including CMV, Novartis halted its marketing efforts for the drug.
