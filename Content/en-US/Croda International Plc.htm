   Not all chemicals are a naturalist's nightmare. Croda International derives many of its sales from oleochemicals (products made from natural oils). The company has restructured its products into three main units. Consumer Care (35% of sales) makes ingredients for the personal care, health care, and agricultural industries. Performance Technologies includes lubricants, coatings and polymers, polymer additives, oilfield chemicals, and home care ingredients. Its Industrial Chemicals unit makes process additives (basic fatty acids, glycerine, and other by-products) and textile and other industrial products.

  <p>
   The company has 18 manufacturing sites and in offices in more than 30 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Western Europe accounted for 37% of Croda's revenues; North America 26%; Asia Pacific 19%, Latin America, 11%; and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, 7%.

  <p>
   The company has fore segments: Personal Care, Life Sciences (Health Care and Crop Care), Performance Technologies, and Industrial Chemicals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Personal Care includes hair care, skin care, sun care, and color cosmetics applications. It accounted for 36% of Croda's 2014 revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Performance Technologies (34%) delivers high-added value additives to a wide range of niche markets. It is organized into five business areas: Lubricants supplies automotive and industrial lubricants companies; Coatings and Polymers serves the coatings, adhesives and speciality polymers markets; Geo Technologies supports customers in oil and gas, water treatment and mining; Polymer Additives sells into the plastics and packaging sector; and Home Care serves household product manufacturers, as well as industrial cleaning companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Life Sciences (20%) comprises two complementary businesses: Health Care and Crop Care. Health Care delivers high-quality ingredients and formulation expertise to pharmaceutical and nutritional markets, which includes dermatology and animal health. Crop Care provides innovative ingredients and formulation expertise to agrochemical companies, enabling them to develop efficient, complex and safe products that help farmers achieve superior yields.
  </p>
  <p>
   Industrial Chemicals (11%) sells a range of co-streams produced during the manufacture of core sector products and undertakes toll processing. Whilst primarily higher in volume and lower in margin, the sector is also developing niche ranges of specialist materials for thermal management, catalysts, electronics, advanced ceramics and other industrial applications.

   The company develops and manufactures products for a wide range of business areas: Coatings and Polymers, Crop Care, Geo Technologies, Health Care, Home Care, Industrial Chemicals, Lubricants, Personal Care and Polymer Additives.
  </p>
  <p>

  <p>
   On a constant currency basis, Croda's revenues rose by 2.9% due to innovation. Sales of New and Protected Products (which have higher margins and stronger barriers to entry such as patents and proprietary technology) grew by 13% on a constant currency basis in 2014. It also increased sales of differentiated products by 1% in constant currency; these provide customers with benefits not easily replicated. Lower margin products declined 7% in 2014 due to lower commodity pricing and exit of low value products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Croda's net income decreased by 7% (in local currency) due to a decline in net sales and higher operating costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities was decreased by 9% (in local currency).

  <p>
   In recent years, Croda has divested its noncore businesses (mainly dyes and pigments units) to focus on specialty chemicals. The company has most of its holdings in oleochemicals, which have produced twice the profit of its other industrial chemicals, and has developed a niche in providing natural ingredients for specific products in the personal care sector. Its products also serve as building blocks for health care products. It has benefited significantly from the demand for its anti-aging products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Croda's strategy is to focus on innovation in fast-growing sectors and economies worldwide. It invests in line with the company's strategic objectives of delivering consistent top and bottom line growth, increasing the proportion of new and protected product sales and investing in a sustainable future. In 2014 It made acquisitions to expand its technology portfolio; strengthened sales and technology in Asia; and moved from a regional to a global organization.
  </p>
  <p>
   It split its Consumer Care business into Personal Care and Life Sciences (Health Care and Crop Care), so that each market's different opportunities and challenges can be addressed and a stronger overall performance delivered. In addition, the Performance Technologies sector is driving innovation and developing new regional markets. This reorganization has given Croda better market focus and customer alignment to drive additional growth.

  <p>
   In 2014 Croda's Coatings &amp; Polymers business and Technology Investment Group acquired AM Coatings, which has developed novel non-leaching antimicrobial technology for coating and adhesive applications. Croda plans to commercialize and exploit this technology firstly to C&amp;P customers and potentially, in the future, into other business sectors.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Croda acquired JD Horizons Limited, a UK-based business specializing in flow assurance technology (under the FlowSolve brand). This strategic acquisition (part of the Croda's Geo Technologies business area) bring's the company closer to end users in the oil and gas market.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 1925 George Crowe bought a waterworks at the village of Rawcliffe Bridge after an acquaintance named Dawe told him he knew a process to make lanolin. Lanolin was already made in continental Europe, but no lanolin factories existed in England at the time. Then, as now, better grades of lanolin were used in cosmetics and ointments. Lesser grades were used to make leather dressings, rope lubricants, textile waterproofing, and greases. Crowe named the company Croda, after "Crowe" and "Dawe," and sent Philip Wood, his 22-year-old nephew, to manage the business. The process Dawe established failed to work properly, but Wood and a Belgian chemist were able to begin making lanolin before the end of the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite processing lanolin successfully, Croda lost money and was almost bankrupt by the end of the decade. Fate intervened in the company's favor when lanolin proved an excellent rust preventative. Fate took another turn with the advent of WWII when the company's profitable ventures were largely replaced by profitless government contracts for gun-cleaning oils, camouflage paints, and insect repellents.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was regrouping after the war when Wood died in 1949. Croda's board opted for committee management with his son, Fred, as sales director. Fred rose to run the company and expanded the company's product range of oleochemicals and opened operations in Italy, Germany, and Japan. The company went public in 1964 and used the stock proceeds to grow through acquisitions. Again, Croda's product range and geographic range expanded.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1986 the parents of Lorenzo Odone, a young boy who suffered from Adrenoleukodystrophy, what was thought to be an untreatable and deadly disease, sought a drug company that would test a fatty acid that, theoretically, could cure their son. Croda agreed and synthesized a liter of "Lorenzo's Oil" from rapeseed. The oil reduced the level of abnormal fats in Lorenzo's bloodstream, and the story was made into a popular movie.
  </p>
  <p>
   When chemical prices fell in the early 1990s, Croda built up its paint and coatings businesses. Croda returned its focus to specialty chemicals in 1998. It sold its paint businesses, an Australian adhesives company, and Hilco, its soap company. The same year Croda acquired Westbrook Lanolin, a UK company with a significant presence in the US medical lanolin market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company sold its pigments and dyes units and shifted its focus to oleochemicals. In 2001 Croda sold its adhesives business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2006, the company expanded that oleochemical business with the acquisition of
   <company id="41791">
    ICI
   </company>
   's
   <company id="135064">
    Uniqema
   </company>
   unit for about $750 million. Eventually, Croda combined the two companies' oleochemicals operations and integrated the rest of Uniqema's businesses as well. In 2007 the company sold its US-based oleochemicals business to
   <company id="120217">
    H.I.G. Capital
   </company>
   , which set the unit up as a stand-alone company with its management in place.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Croda sold its Emmerich site and associated business in Germany to KLK Emmerich GmbH, a subsidiary of the KLK Group for $87 million. The disposal completed Croda's restructuring program to focus on its oleochemical operations. Also in 2010, Croda bought out its joint venture partner PT Croda Indonesia's 40% share in its Indonesia operations for $1.6 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Croda's overall performance in 2011 elevated it to the FTSE 100 in 2012, consisting of 100 companies in the UK with the highest market values.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has restructured its units for 2012 and hopes to replicate its success in its Consumer Care unit to boost its polymer additives sales. It plans to follow its strategy of launching new products in niche markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Croda completed the sale of its 60% stake in its Korean joint venture, Croda Woobang, to its venture partner in a deal worth about £2.2 million ($3.5 million) in early 2012. The operation was part of its Industrial Specialties segment.
