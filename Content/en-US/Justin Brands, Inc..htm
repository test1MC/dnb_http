   Once a unit of Justin Industries, Justin Brands two-stepped away, returning to its cowboy roots. The firm is best known as a maker of western boots under the Justin Boots, Nocona Boots, Chippewa Boots, Tony Lama, and Justin Original Workboots brands, but it also makes and markets work, safety, and sports footwear. Its western boots come in a variety of exotic leathers, including lizard and ostrich. Justin Brands sells its footwear through department stores, shoe chains, specialty stores (

   ), catalogs, and online (

   ). It also caters to cowboys and fillies who want to learn more about the West through its Northland Publishing unit. Justin Brands is owned by

   Justin sells its boots through a network of some 5,000 retailers. The company has outlet stores for factory seconds and discontinued lines. Justin Brands leverages

   to market itself. The boots manufacturer launched its Justin Bent Rail line through the social networking channels and, as a result, sales exceeded the company's goals by 30%.

   Not one to miss a chance to make a buck, Justin's boots are sold at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting presided over by Buffet himself. At the meeting in 2013, shareholders purchased 1,062 pairs of Justin Boots in just nine hours.

   In recent years, Justin Brands has partnered with icons and relied on product placement to peddle its products. The company offers a boot collection under licensing agreements with country singers George Strait, Brad Paisley, and Jason Aldean. Justin Brands also markets its brands through product placement in films such as Ocean's Thirteen, No Country for Old Men, and American Gangster.

   In May 2013, Justin Brands purchased Highland Shoe Company, a made-in-America footwear manufacturer in Brewer, Maine. The purchase added a fourth factory to Justin's US operations. Highland, which produces more than 400 pairs of hand-sewn shoes a week, was founded in 2003 and makes shoes for Yuketen, Red Wing, Oak Street Bootmakers, and Sperry Top-Sider.

   In 1879 H. J. Justin, still in his twenties, borrowed $35 to start a boot-repair business in a small Texas town along the Chisholm Trail. H. J. soon switched to boot making and moved his business to Nocona, Texas. After H. J. died in 1908, his three sons took over. They moved the business to Fort Worth in 1925, while H. J.'s daughter stayed in town and began the Nocona Boot Co. Justin ventured into building products in 1968 by acquiring Acme Brick Company (founded 1891). In 1972 the two companies became Justin Industries. In 1981 Justin bought Nocona Boots, and in 1990 it acquired the Tony Lama Co.
  </p>
        <p>
   With western wear in style, Justin's footwear peaked in 1993, but sales declined as fashion trends changed. In 1997 sales decreased for the third consecutive year as the company's lagging footwear sector dragged down the gains made by its building products sector.
  </p>
        <p>
   A strong housing market lifted the sales of Acme Brick products in 1998, and even its footwear division began to gain sound footing. John Justin Jr. stepped down as chairman and CEO of Justin after fifty years of service to the family-owned company in 1999; he died in 2001 at the age of 84. Also in 1999 Justin split its footwear and building products businesses into separate companies. As part of its restructuring, Justin moved its 75-year-old Fort Worth boot-making operations to El Paso, Texas, and Cassville, Missouri. Justin also closed its Nocona, Texas, boot factory and cut 280 jobs.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2000 the company was acquired by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holding company in a $600 million cash deal. Four years later Justin signed a licensing deal with country music legend George Strait and began offering boots with his name on them.
