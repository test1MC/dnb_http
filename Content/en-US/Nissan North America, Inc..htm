   The deep pockets of the company's parent and its alliance with
   <company id="41191">
    Renault
   </company>
   have allowed Nissan's businesses to continue to expand geographically and technologically. The Renault-Nissan Alliance was forged in order to take advantage of the synergies between the two companies. The partnership also allows them the opportunity to tackle capital intensive projects, such as electric vehicles, that they would otherwise not be able to afford separately.
  </p>
  <p>
   One of the premiere projects for the Alliance is its 100% electric, zero-emission vehicle. Intent upon putting a dent in
   <company id="41889">

   Nissan North America in 2012 announced it would produce an all-new 2013 Nissan Sentra line of compact cars and a redesigned 2013 Pathfinder SUV. Also that year, it divulged plans to construct a $2 billion manufacturing facility in Aguascalientes, Mexico to support the company's growth strategy. The new facility, which fortifies Nissan's two existing Mexican manufacturing plants and was launched in late 2013.
