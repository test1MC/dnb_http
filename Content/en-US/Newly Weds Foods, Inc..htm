   Don't let the name fool you, Newly Weds Foods hasn't made a specialty cake since 1952 but rather works to discover new customized food coatings. The company specializes in making seasonings, marinades, glazes, sauces, batters, breadings, binders, and fillers for the food processing and foodservice industries in some 70 countries worldwide. Newly Weds uses its proprietary FlavorTrak database to monitor restaurant trends and then develop flavors it hopes will appeal to the most consumers. Newly Weds boasts that it has expertise in providing ingredients for more than 45 cuisines. As part of its business, the Chicago-based company owns and operates about 25 production plants and nearly 20 laboratories.

   In 2014 Newly Weds purchased Continental Seasoning, an industrial seasoning manufacturer ing New Jersey, for an undisclosed sum. It makes seasoning blends, spices, and ingredients for meat, poultry, meat snack, and seafood processors.
  </p>
  <p>
   To build its core coatings business, Newly Weds Foods in 2012 purchased industrial food-coating company Continental Mills, based in Tukwila, Washington. The deal gave Newly Weds Foods a 55,000-sq.-ft. manufacturing facility located in Pendleton, Oregon, and a leg up in starch- and flour-based coatings and batters for both potato and poultry application and protein and vegetable type substrates.

  <p>
   Owner and President Charles T. Angell inherited the company, which his father founded in the 1930s. The elder Angell created a rolled ice-cream cake that "married" cake and ice cream, hence the name Newly Weds Foods.
