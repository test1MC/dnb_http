  <p>
   Packaging is part of the Bryce Corporation's DNA. William H. Bryce Sr. served as a partner in the Dixie Wax Paper Company (subsequently DIXICO) in the 1920s. He was involved in the creation of waxed paper. His son William Jr. founded Bryce Corporation in 1969 and spearheaded the packaging industry's evolution from paper to plastic containers.
