  <p>
   In response to a sluggish construction market, Tredegar closed down the Bonnell plant in Kentland, Indiana, in 2012. At the same time, the company began working to expand in industries outside of the construction market. In 2013 the company conducted a $17 million expansion project at its Newnan manufacturing facility, to increase its capacity for projects in the automotive industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company scaled back its operations in Canada with the sale of its Bon L Canada (aluminum, fiberglass, and wooden ladders) and Apolo Tool and Die Manufacturing units to Signature Aluminum in 2008. Tredegar used the money to fund the expansion of its Carthage, Tennessee manufacturing facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mergers and Acquisitions
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Bonnell acquired AACOA, a North America-based aluminum extrusion manufacturer, for some $51 million. The purchase expanded Bonnell's fabrication capabilities, adding plants in Elkhart, Indiana, and Niles, Michigan. It also assisted Bonnell's goal of expanding in non-construction industries.
