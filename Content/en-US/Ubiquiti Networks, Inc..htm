   For Ubiquiti Networks, the last mile could prove to be the "green" mile. The company and its subsidiaries design, manufacture, and sell a portfolio of wireless broadband networking products based on proprietary technologies that are intended to help provide connectivity in underserved markets, particularly areas of the world known as "the last mile" that can't support infrastructure for wired networking. Products include AirMax antennas, Bullet outdoor radio devices, NanoStation integrated wireless devices, SuperRange embedded radios, and the UniFi wireless network. It primarily sells to network operators and service providers through a network of distributors, resellers, and OEMs.

  <p>
   With subsidiaries in Hong Kong, India, and Lithuania, Ubiquiti Networks' business model revolves around trying to penetrate emerging markets and remote areas where individuals and small and midsized enterprises do not have access to the benefits of carrier-class broadband networking. Its radios, antennas, and management tools are designed to deliver carrier-class performance for wireless networking in the unlicensed radio frequency (RF) spectrum.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ubiquiti Networks gets 63% of its revenue from service providers for infrastructure products for fixed wireless broadband, wireless backhaul systems, and routing. Sales to enterprises accounted for 37% of revenue. Products aims at companies provide wireless LAN infrastructure, video surveillance, switching and routing, and machine-to-machine communication. This accounted for 37% of the total revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most of the company's revenue depends on products that include components from

    Quacomm Atheros
   </company>
   . Ubiquiti Networks' licensing agreement with Qualcomm Atheros automatically renews year-to-year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The manufacturing of Ubiquiti Networks' products is handled by contract manufacturers in China. The contractors also take care of quality control and shipping.

   Ubiquiti Networks is headquartered in San Jose, California.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some 40% of its revenue comes from customers in Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, followed by 36% from North America, 13% from South America, and 11% from the Asia/Pacific region.

  <p>
   Instead of employing a traditional direct sales force, the company relies on an online community of network operators, service providers, and distributors known as the Ubiquiti Community to drive awareness and demand through viral information dissemination. Members of this community also help to provide its engineers with product feedback central to its research and development efforts. This unconventional model enables substantial cost savings, but it's also a risky move to rely on a single, largely customer-driven channel for everything from sales and marketing to product development and technical support.

   Ubiquiti Networks has set company records in revenue and profit in the past several years and that continued in 2016 (ended June).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's revenue was $666 million in 2016, which was 12% more than $596 million in 2015. Enterprise products drove revenue higher with a 39% sales increase in 2016. Service provider sales were flat for the year. Sales rose in all geographic markets except South America where they fell 12%, which the company blamed on political instability and the strong US dollar.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits rose a seemingly astonishing 64% to $13.6 million in 2016 from $129.6 million in 2015. Part of the profit came from the recovery of $39 million related to an email fraud compromise that occurred in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations rose to $197.5 million in 2016 from $134.5 million in 2015.

   Ubiquiti Networks eventually plans to expand into new product areas, such as enterprise wireless local area network (WLAN), its UniFi product, and video surveillance equipment, which may make its financial future even more uncertain. New product development costs could negatively affect its profitability, and it will also face competitors with more capabilities and resources.
  </p>
  <p>
   In May 2016, the company announced AmpliFi, which is designed for homes with multiple connected devices. It is to allow high-quality video streaming and fast Internet bandwidth with no Wi-Fi dead zones. Ubiquiti Networks planned to ship AmpliFi products in fiscal 2017.
