   Vallourec is out to steel its clients' businesses - the company ranks among the world's top producers of steel tubing. It caters to oil and gas, automotive, and mechanical engineering customers worldwide. Vallourec's seamless tubes unit, Vallourec Tubes, makes welded and drawn tubes primarily for the energy industry, while its automotive and specialty products division makes tubes and stainless steel products for the auto industry, among others. The French company has manufacturing facilities in more than 20 countries and rings up about 80% of its sales outside of Europe.

  <p>
   The company operates two main business segments: Seamless Tubes and Specialty Products. It also owns holding, sales, and marketing companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Seamless Tubes segment, which brings in the vast majority of the Group's revenue at around 96%, supplies three main markets: Oil &amp; Gas and Petrochemicals; Power Generation; and Industries. For Oil &amp; Gas and Petrochemicals, the Group designs and develops products including seamless tubing and premium connections for drilling operations, line pipe, and well equipment operating in extreme conditions. Vallourec's Power Generation segment offers a range of highly pressure and temperature resistant tubes. And its Industries business offers tubular products for mechanical engineering, automotive, construction and other industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Specialty Products, which accounts for the remaining revenue, brings together companies that manufacture and process welded and seamless tubes in stainless steel and special alloys, primarily for the energy markets.

  <p>
   Vallourec is headquartered in Boulogne Billancourt Cedex, Hauts De Seine France. Vallourec has a global presence, with operations in the United States, Brazil, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   North America accounted the highest chunk of revenue at about 31% of total net sales in fiscal 2014, followed by Asia with 25%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company serves industries such as power generation, petrochemicals, mechanical engineering, construction and oil &amp; gas.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's main customers include, DNOC, Aramco, Champions Pipe &amp; Supply, DongFang, Exxon, Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, Pipeco Services, Salzgitter, and Toolpushers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's products are sold through distributors or directly to customers. In 2014, the five largest customers accounted for 29% of sales.

  </p>
  <p>
   Net sales have been trending upwards since 2010, and reached €5.7 billion in fiscal 2014, a €123 million increase, or 2%. The main factor behind this was a positive effect on sales volume; Seamless tubes sales increased by €84.3 million, accounting for much of the overall sales increase.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, Vallourec swung into net loss in 2014, incurring a loss of €924 million, following profit of around €262 million the previous year. This change was due to an exceptional impairment of €1.1 billion, which was a result of the oil and gas industry hurting from the crash in the oil price; in many cases companies in secondary industries, which includes Vallourec, were hit harder than oil producers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations grew by €136 million, or 26%, to €662 million due to changes in working capital requirements.

  <p>
   The board has undertaken restructuring activity in response to adverse market conditions. It cut investment and slashed 3,500 jobs in 2015 after customers halted exploration and drilling and looked to other avenues after revenue from oil production slumped. Vallourec has cut production capacity in Europe by half, and closed plants in France, Germany and Scotland, for the loss of a further 1,000 jobs.
