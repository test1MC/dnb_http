   Sure, you could buy it cheaper elsewhere, but the child standing on your doorstep is asking for only a couple of bucks for a worthy cause and an oversized candy bar made by World's Finest Chocolate (WFC). The confectioner is a maker of chocolate candy for fundraisers. WFC manufactures chocolate bars, panned chocolates, and foil-wrapped chocolates. In addition, it offers chocolate-covered raisins, mints, malted milk balls, pretzels, and nuts and fruit, along with cocoa powder, toppings, and a sugar-free line. As part of its business, WFC provides custom and personalized labeling services. Some of WFC's raw cocoa beans come from its cocoa plantation on the West Indies island of St. Lucia.

   Based in Chicago, WFC sells its sweets across North America, operating a pair of outlet stores in its home state and an additional outlet store in Canada.

   The company's fundraising customers include schools, athletic teams, service organizations, charitable causes, and other not-for-profits. While the agreement is no longer exclusive, WFC operates a combined sales force with QSP, a fundraising subsidiary of
   <company id="14377">
    Reader's Digest
   </company>
   . The deal has given QSP the right to use WFC products as fundraisers and allows WFC to focus on its manufacturing business. WFC, on the other hand, runs the sales operations for its private-label and bulk orders, retail customers, corporate gifts, gift baskets, its Illinois outlet stores, as well as for its website and catalog.

   Founded in 1918 by Edmond Opler, WFC has sold more than 6 billion chocolate candy bars and has helped to raise more than $3.8 billion.

  <p>
   Founder Edmond Opler Sr. began his career at age 13 as a wagon boy for a New York salesman for Runkle Brothers Chocolate Manufacturers. Opler eventually became Runkle's New England sales representative. Following WWI, at age 26, Opler moved to Chicago with his brother Arnold, whose New York chocolate business had failed. The two founded E &amp; A Opler, a cocoa packaging operation. The company prospered before being sold in 1935 to Rockwood &amp; Company of Brooklyn. That year Edmond bought half of Chicago chocolate maker Siren Mills; Nestle bought that company in 1938. Later that year Edmond founded Cook Chocolate and began producing World's Finest Chocolate candies.
  </p>
  <p>
   A request from a boys' baseball team to resell chocolate bars led to the creation of Cook's fund-raising division in 1948. Cook opened its plant in Canada in 1959 and became World's Finest Chocolate (WFC) in 1972. In 1979 WFC opened its Sydney, Australia, plant, and three years later it acquired the Union Vale Cocoa Estate on St. Lucia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Edmond Sr. retired in 1988 at age 91, and his son, Edmond Jr., was named president and CEO. Three years later the company agreed to pay a settlement of more than $2 million to blacks and women who were denied jobs between 1982 and 1984. Edmond Sr. died in 1995. The next year WFC introduced its Advanced Order Program, allowing fund-raisers to take advance orders rather than selling door-to-door.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 WFC inked a deal with Reader's Digest's fund-raising unit, QSP, to combine sales forces and product lines. The agreement allowed the candy company to focus on production, while QSP received an exclusive right to sell WFC products for fund-raisers and gained access to WFC's large client base. (The exclusivity part of the deal expired in 2008.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 WFC joined several other chocolate makers in agreeing to work with child labor experts, lawmakers, growers, and unions to eliminate child slavery and other unsavory labor practices on cocoa farms in Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   To take better advantage of its capacity, in 2002 the company decided to broaden its range and announced it would start making private-label premium chocolates for corporate gift giving and promotions. It also began offering bulk chocolate, chocolate ingredients, and finished chocolates for sale to food manufacturers. In 2003 the company introduced its branded retail line and in 2006 it bought chocolate covered cherry brand Queen Anne.
