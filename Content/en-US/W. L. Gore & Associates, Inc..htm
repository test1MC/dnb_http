   Although the company's Gore-Tex fabric is a household name, W. L. Gore's product portfolio stretches across a diversity of markets, helping to buffer the company from industry fluctuations. To this end, W. L. Gore focuses on technological innovation. Its thousands of engineered products are based on one synthetic material -- expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) -- a polymer with near limitless applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company expanded its reach into the Asia/Pacific region through the launching of stent-graft products in Australia and New Zealand.

  <p>
   In 1941 Wilbert L. (Bill) Gore, a
   <company id="10487">
    DuPont
   </company>
   scientist, started researching and developing plastics, polymers, and resins. One project at DuPont that Gore worked on was the development of a synthetic substance commonly known as Teflon.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seeing an untapped market for Teflon-type products, Gore quit DuPont and in 1958 started his own business. He worked with his wife, Genevieve, and his son, Bob, a chemical engineering student. Bob helped him develop the company's first major product line -- Teflon-insulated electronic wires and cables.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the success of its cables, the company was able to move out of the family basement and into a facility in Newark, Delaware. By 1965 Gore employed 200 people and soon implemented the lattice structure of management, eschewing demands for personal commitments and emphasizing cooperation and teamwork as paramount tenets of the business. A second plant was opened in Flagstaff, Arizona, in 1967.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bob Gore, who had earned a doctorate in chemistry, hit the synthetic plastic mother-lode in 1969. While experimenting with Teflon, he discovered a way to stretch the material at microscopic levels, creating a fabric with holes large enough for body heat and moisture to escape, but small enough to deflect raindrops. Gore applied for a patent on its GORE-TEX fabric in 1970 and received it six years later. The company experienced an explosive period of growth as GORE-TEX found its way into space suits, sporting apparel, filters, and artificial arteries. Bob Gore became the company's president during this time.
