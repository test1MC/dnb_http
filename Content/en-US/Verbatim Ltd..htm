   Verbatim made its name providing storage media such as CDs and DVDs, magnetic tape, floppy disks, and memory cards. But the subsidiary of Mitsubishi Kagaku Media (itself owned by
   <company id="52314">
    Mitsubishi Chemical Corp.
   </company>
   ), also sells low-power and long lived LED and OLED lighting products as well as, more recently, water filtration systems. Verbatim also has begun selling products for 3D printing. More products include Blu-ray media, external hard drives, solid state drives, and USB drives. The company claims to have the biggest share of recorded optical discs by brand. Verbatim products are sold some 120 countries.

   Expanding beyond its traditional memory markets, Verbatim is using technologies developed by its parent to make and sell lighting products, primarily energy-efficient LED and OLED products for consumers and businesses. Using the same playbook, Verbatim also has ventured into 3D printing by selling the materials that turn digits into three-dimensional figures. Its water filtration systems come in pitchers and faucet attachments.
