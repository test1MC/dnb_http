  <p>
   TaylorMade-adidas and its rivals are contending with golf's waning popularity and, consequently, a downturn in demand for golf equipment and apparel. Despite the challenging golf market, the company widened its market share lead in irons and gained market share in footwear, where sales were up 16% on a currency-neutral basis. The company is working to extend its market leadership in the development and distribution of technologically advanced metalwoods, irons, wedges, putters, balls, footwear, and apparel. TaylorMade-adidas points to innovations, such as its JetSpeed metalwood product line launched in late 2013. Also in 2013, adidas Golf launched the adizero golf footwear collection.
  </p>
  <p>
   To boost its presence abroad, the company has been developing innovative products and expanding its metalwoods business outside the US. The latter effort is through partnerships the likes of the China Golf Association. TaylorMade-adidas is working to achieve the same market share worldwide that it has in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep itself lean and mean, the company has been selling off brands that aren't top performers. TaylorMade-adidas divested the Maxfli brand to allow the company to focus on its namesake golf balls.

  <p>
   Improving its drivers and other golfing items has always been a focus, but in recent years TaylorMade-adidas has concentrated on building its brand through acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   To broaden its product range and customer base, TaylorMade-adidas in 2012 acquired Texas-based Adams Golf for $70 million. The last large purchase the company made was in 2008, when it bought golf apparel maker
   <company id="14028">
    Ashworth
   </company>
   for about $73 million. Acquiring Ashworth gave TaylorMade-adidas a vast products portfolio, a boost in its distribution capacity, and a greater marketing presence. Ashworth makes men's and women's sportswear and accessories under the Ashworth, Callaway Golf (under license), Kudzu, and The Game brand names.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company works to maintain its brands' high visibility on the world's major professional golf tours.
  </p>
  <p>
   Buying Ashworth has allowed TaylorMade-adidas Golf to establish a golf lifestyle business akin to what
   <company id="40369">
    Ralph Lauren
   </company>
   has built with his Polo brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company adds credibility and visibility to its well-known adidas Golf, TaylorMade, and Ashworth names by traveling with professional golf tours. TaylorMade-adidas Golf's core sales channels include green-grass retailers, off-course golf specialty retailers, and sporting goods stores with golf departments.
