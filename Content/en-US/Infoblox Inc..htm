   Inflobox posted higher revenue, cut its net loss in half, and generated more cash from operations  in 2016 (ended July) compare to 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenue jumped 17% to $358 million in 2016 with strong contributions from products and licensing and services. Products and licensing saw increased unit sales, products that replaced older generations of products, and sales of security products. Higher prices also contributed. A growing customer based pushed services revenue higher. The company also posted higher subscription revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Infoblox's net loss dropped to $14 million in 2016 from $27 million the year before. The company maintained spending on research and development and sales and marketing, but higher revenue helped cut the loss.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations rose to $68 million in 2016 from $48 million in 2015. A large part of the 2016 cash flow came from a $36 million increase in deferred revenue.

   To expand its customer base, Infoblox continues to invest in its sales team, as well as its channel partners, through such efforts as product education and sales and support training. The company looks to technology partnerships, acquisitions, and heavy investments in R&amp;D to grow its products. Investment from Vista Equity Partners should benefit Infoblox on all levels. Vista invests in the technology development and personnel of its portfolio companies.

  <p>
   In 2016, Infoblox took steps to reduce some costs through a restructuring. The goal was to adjust hiring to support customer-facing sales, increase sales and marketing efficiency, and reduce headcount in higher-cost locations and for some positions. The restructuring cost about $6 million in 2016, but the company expects lower operating expenses in 2017
