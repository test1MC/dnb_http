   Accesso Technology Group wants to keep the flow going for its clients. The company develops theme park ride reservation systems. The systems consist of a central computer used to schedule rides, wireless communication stations located throughout the park, and handheld devices. In the company's Lo-Queue line of products, QBots are messaging devices that beep to let customers know when they can board a ride. For patrons with mobile phones, Qsmart communicates with smartphones when a ride is available. Accesso products are used by parks throughout the world, including about 10

   parks in the US. The company was inspired by the frustration founding director Leonard Sims felt once while waiting in line for an amusement park ride.
