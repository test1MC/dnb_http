   Organogenesis has the skinny on replacement tissue. Its flagship product, Apligraf, is a human skin substitute approved to treat diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers caused by poor circulation. It has delivered more than 500,000 units of Apligraf for patient treatment. Rejection-resistant Apligraf is bio-engineered using living skin cells and has been used to treat chronic open wounds. Founded in 1985, the company is developing a next-generation of the material using all human components via its VCT technology. It also offers a line of biomaterials used in a range of surgical procedures to seal or reconstruct soft tissue and develops regenerative technologies in the area of cosmetic skin rejuvenation.

   Organogenesis is part of a consortium (along with

   and

   researchers) that has won a federal government grant to develop new regenerative treatments for wounded soldiers. The company's research and development unit also regularly collaborates with academia.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company is involved in the development of several medical technologies. Organogenesis employs its FortaFlex technology, a collagen-based biomaterial derived from pig tissue, in a variety of bio-surgery applications. Its CuffPatch, marketed by

   markets its BioSTAR product for repairing patent foramen ovale (a hole in the heart). The company also has an agreement with

   to distribute its FortaFlex technology, designed to repair torn tendons, under the Inforce Reinforcement Matrix brand name.

   Organogenesis Switzerland Gmbh was established to help facilitate its global expansion plans. Overseas sales of the company's Apligraf cell therapy line has received a boost since the product gained Swiss reimbursement in 2008.

   The company has developed applications in the field of oral soft tissue regeneration and, as a result, recently entered into a completely new therapeutic class in dentistry. As part of this noteworthy achievement, Organogenesis launched its first product -- GINTUIT -- for the dental surgery market. The product was approved by the
   <company id="144161">
    US Food and Drug Administration
   </company>
   (FDA) for the treatment of mucogingival conditions in adults, and is the first FDA-approved cell-based product for use in dentistry. GINTUIT became commercially available through a controlled market release in mid-2012 and rolled out to the broader US market in 2013.
  </p>
        <p>
   Organogenesis is focused on several other initiatives. It's working to advance its cell culture technologies and develop new cell-based products. To keep costs low, the company developed an automated closed bio-reactor system for culturing Apligraf. The company concentrates on boosting the number of early-phase regenerative medicine start-ups, as well.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 federal health care contractor National Government Services and Medicare program contractor Noridian Administrative Services amended its coverage policy for Apligraf. The change enables physicians to treat patients with Apligraf in accordance with its FDA labeling criteria of weekly assessment and up to five applications as needed.
  </p>
        <p>
   To accommodate its growth, Organogenesis is in the middle of a multi-year expansion of its headquarters, research and development facilities, and manufacturing facilities in Massachusetts into a four-building campus.

   Organogenesis expanded its regenerative medicine capabilities by purchasing NuTech Medical, a maker of amniotic biologic products for healing wounds and surgical orthopedics, in 2017. NuTech will remain in Birmingham, Alabama, but is expected to boost its sales staff as part of Organogenesis. The deal ushers Organogenesis into the amniotic segment of the biologics market.</p>
