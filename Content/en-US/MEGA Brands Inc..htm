   MEGA Brands want to ensure that today's kids grow up to be creative blokheads. The company makes plastic building blocks and other construction and magnetic toys, as well as puzzles, and games for preschoolers on up. Its toy brands include Mega Bloks, Mega Games, Mega Puzzles, and Magnext. Its Rose Art and Board Dudes businesses make and sell art materials, including crayons, markers, paints, and modeling dough, and presentation boards and writing instruments.  While North America accounts for about two-thirds of the company's sales, its products are sold in more than 100 countries worldwide. US toy giant

   MEGA Brands' 2013 revenue was $404.7 million, 4% less than the previous year. A 5% drop in global toy sales was offset by a 1% increase in the Stationery business. The company cut expenses and got a lucky break on currency conversions to post a 25% uptick in net income, from $16.6 million to $20.8 million.
