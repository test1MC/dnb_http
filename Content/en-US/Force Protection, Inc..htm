   Force Protection's vehicles protect military forces from deadly blasts. The company makes armored land vehicles designed to protect troops from landmines, roadside bombs, and hostile fire. It provides its large Buffalo and medium-sized Cougar mine-protected vehicles to foreign customers, such as the UK Ministry of Defence. The Cougar family includes such variants as the Mastiff, Ridgback, and Wolfhound. Its other main products include the lighter-weight Cheetah, Ocelot, and JAMMA (joint all-terrain modular mobility asset) vehicles. Force Protection is part of
   <company id="105179">
    General Dynamics' Land Systems
   </company>
   segment.

   Force Protection continues to manufacture and supply larger, heavier-weight vehicles, such as the Buffalo, which is routinely used in route clearance missions. However, it is anticipated that lighter-weight and more agile versions will be adopted as militaries around the world modernize their tactical vehicle fleets. This is consistent with what's happening in the UK with the LPPV program and in Australia with the Land 121 requirement. Force Protection expects that a similar strategy will be followed in the US.
