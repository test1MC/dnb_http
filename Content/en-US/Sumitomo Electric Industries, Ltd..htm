   You might say that Sumitomo Electric Industries (SEI) produces the wide world of wire. The company, which has more than 320 subsidiaries and affiliates around the globe, is Japan's largest producer of wire and cable. SEI's automotive segment, about half of sales, makes automotive wiring harnesses, wires, wheel speed sensors, and dash boards. Next in sales is the electric wire and cable division, which makes power and industrial cables, as well as magnetic and hybrid products. Other units produce optical fiber cables, fiber-optic components, industrial cables, printed circuits, ultrafine wire, and semiconductors. SEI was formed in 1897 as Sumitomo Copper Rolling Works.

  <p>
   Sumitomo Electric Industries, as a part of the Sumitomo group business, began nearly 400 years ago with the paired talents of spiritual founder Masatomo Sumitomo (who had received training as a Buddhist priest) and his disciple and brother-in-law, Riemon Soga. Sumitomo wrote treatises on the conduct of commercial activity, and Soga applied his technological skill in extracting silver from copper ore, improving upon traditional Western methods, and opened a copper business in Kyoto in 1590 that soon transformed the copper refining industry in Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   Soga's prosperous copper business became the founding company of the Sumitomo group. After Soga died in 1636, his son, Tomomochi, married Masatomo's daughter (entering into the Sumitomo family) and became the company's leader.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the late 1600s the family was one of Japan's top copper producers. The house of Sumitomo entered several other businesses by the mid-1800s in order to insulate itself from waning copper production. The family established the Sumitomo Copper Rolling Works in 1897 to produce bare copper wire.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1909 production of cable for Japan's telecommunications industry began, and in 1920 the family took their company public, renaming it Sumitomo Electric Wire &amp; Cable Works. The next year the company added high-carbon steel wire manufacturing. Its name changed to Sumitomo Electric Industries (SEI) in 1939.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company began making rubber products for use in aircraft fuel tanks in 1943. The decade drew to a close with the addition of overhead transmission cable engineering operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   SEI continued to move into new businesses in the 1960s. In 1960 SEI took a 25% stake in Sumitomo 3M, a three-way joint venture with
   <company id="41876">
    NEC
   </company>
   (25%) and
   <company id="11003">
    3M
   </company>
   (50%) to produce industrial cable in Japan. To capitalize on the boom in Japan's automobile and industrial equipment industries, SEI introduced disc brakes to its lineup in 1963. Also, SEI formally entered into management participation in Japan's Dunlop Tire Company, which was then renamed
   <company id="57043">
    Sumitomo Rubber Industries
   </company>
   . (It had initially invested in the tire maker in 1960.)
  </p>
  <p>
   SEI hit pay dirt with its automotive businesses, producing brakes for manufacturers of passenger cars, commercial vehicles, motorcycles, construction and industrial equipment, and railcars. In the late 1960s SEI added traffic control systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the introduction of compound semiconductors (used in wireless transmitters and electronic control devices) and cable television systems, the 1970s brought SEI into the arena of value-added high-tech products. SEI began producing optical-fiber cable in 1974.
  </p>
  <p>
   SEI expanded further into fiber optics when it introduced its first LAN in 1981 and set up its US-based Sumitomo Electric Lightwave unit in 1983.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1987 the company began producing antilock brakes (ABS) and invested $45 million in an evenly split ABS manufacturing US joint venture (Lucas Sumitomo) with a unit of Lucas Varity. Lucas Varity was later bought by TRW, and Sumitomo eventually acquired its remaining 50%. SEI closed out the 1980s by adding satellite navigation systems to its growing automobile product offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1990s saw wider global expansion through more alliances and acquisitions. In 1990 SEI teamed up again with Lucas Varity to establish a joint venture in the UK to make automobile wiring harnesses. (SEI, together with one of its own affiliates, bought Lucas' half share in the company in 1999.) That year SEI, through its Sumitomo Electric Wiring Systems unit, formed AutoNeural Systems, a joint venture with
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   -affiliated
   <company id="57867">
    Visteon
   </company>
   for automobile wiring harnesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 SEI set up ExceLight Communications (spun off from Sumitomo Electric Lightwave) to make optical components and subsystems for telecommunications, cable TV, and broadband equipment industries. The company restructured its electric power cable operations in early 2001, forming a manufacturing joint venture with
   <company id="119606">
    Hitachi Cable
   </company>
   and shutting one of its plants in Japan. Early the following year SEI acquired the Japan-based
   <company id="117329">
    Calsonic Kansei Corporation
   </company>
   's wiring harness business. SEI closed its electric furnaces in Japan and spun off its Sumitomo Steel Wire Corp. in late 2002. In early 2003 the company joined efforts with Hitachi Cable and Tatsuta Electric Wire &amp; Cable to form Sumiden Hitachi Cable Ltd., a company that specialized in the manufacture of low-voltage power cables.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company acquired the former Volkswagen Bordnetze (now called Sumitomo Electric Bordnetze), a Germany-based manufacturer of wire harnesses, from its previous joint owners,
   <company id="41853">
    Volkswagen
   </company>
   and
   <company id="104697">
    VDO Automotive
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Continuing to strengthen its European operations, the company, along with subsidiary Sumitomo Electric Sintered Alloy, acquired Germany-based Cloyes Europe, a sintered parts maker, in 2007. SEI will use this acquisition to supply Japanese auto parts makers that have manufacturing facilities in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2007, as part of a group realignment, SEI increased its ownership in
   <company id="59467">
    Nissin Electric
   </company>
   to more than 50%, and it acquired affiliate Toyokuni Electric Cable. The acquisitions are part of the company's efforts to position itself as a global player.
