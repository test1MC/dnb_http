   Bleach Group is looking to add some color to the fashion world. The company formed in 2012 to combine three clothing brands -- Insight, Ksubi, and Something Else -- that originated in Australia. Its most well-known brand, Insight, makes action sports apparel for men and women, while Ksubi offers men's and women's denim, fashion, and accessories to the hipster crowd. Something Else targets young women with&#160;trendy clothes that have an offbeat vibe. Bleach Group's clothes and accessories, which are manufactured in Asia, are sold online and through retailers, including

    Urban Outfitters
   </company>
   , in more than 40 countries. Australia accounts for almost 45% of sales. The company filed an IPO in the US in February 2013.

        <p>
   Bleach Group aims to raise $16.5 million and take home $14.25 million in net proceeds. It plans to use the proceeds to invest in building out retail stores under the Ksubi brand and develop a new storefront named Sugarmill that will sell Insight and Ksubi clothes. It also wants to develop its online retail platform, create another private-label brand, and reacquire the distribution rights for the Insight brand in the US, among other things.

   Bleach Group's clothes and accessories are sold in more than 40 countries. Australia, its home country, is its largest market, followed by the US (23% of sales in 2012), Europe (16%), and Asia (10%). In Australia major retailers such as General Pants and Ozmosis sell the brands, while the US counts retailers such as

   ,
   <company id="105266">
    Bloomingdales
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="16000">
    PacSun
   </company>
   . The company controls distribution in Australia and Europe and uses independent distributors in all other countries, including the US.

        <p>
   The company's retail strategy is in line with selling mid-priced trendy clothes to the youth market. It plans to continue to develop its brands with new product lines, perhaps expanding the Insights action sports brand to include surfboards and skateboards and the Ksubi and Something Else lines with jewelry and house wares. The Ksubi brand was bought out of bankruptcy in 2010, and the company will consider making other strategic acquisitions. Much of the group's growth strategy is dependent on how much capital it raises in the IPO.

   Sales remained relatively flat from 2011 to 2012. Insights, its largest brand, accounts for 60% of the company's overall sales. About half of Insights' sales are to customers outside Australia. Ksubi accounts for about 30% of the Bleach Group's sales, and 80% of its sales come from Australia, where the brand has eight retail stores operated by a franchisor. Something Else accounts for 10% of total sales. About two-thirds of its sales come from Australia, and the company is looking to grow the brand in Hong Kong, the UK, and the US.

   The Insight brand was founded as a surfboard label by Andrew Down in Sydney in 1987. Some 10 years later graphic artist George Gorrow (one of the Ksubi founders) partnered with Down to develop the Insight brand to include clothing and move away from sports gear. In 2005 the Something Else brand was created to target young women with trendy, fashionable clothes. In 2010 the group bought Ksubi out of bankruptcy.
