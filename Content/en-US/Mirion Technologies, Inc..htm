   Mirion gets most of its sales from the nuclear market, including sales to mine, fuel manufacturing facility, nuclear reactor, fuel reprocessing, military, weapons, and waste storage installations. The company touts that its products are installed in about 90% of active nuclear reactors around the world, including all of those operating in the US.

   It also serves the medical market, where increased use of nuclear and radiological diagnostic and therapeutic procedures is driven by an aging global population and by emerging opportunities in markets such as India and China. Safety concerns have increased demand for dosimetry and radiation detection and monitoring products by hospitals, clinics, and medical imaging facilities. In the defense market, Mirion's growth has largely been tied to civil defense, military, and other government spending initiatives to combat worldwide security threats.
