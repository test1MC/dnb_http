   For the David Clark Company, noise annoys and communication is key. The company makes a number of headsets for use in auto racing, aviation, broadcasting, military, railroad transportation, and other applications, along with noise protection products. It also produces pressurized suits for astronauts and aviators (the Apollo space mission crews wore them to the moon and back, and U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers was wearing one when he was shot down by the Soviet Union in 1960). The company was founded in 1935 by David M. Clark; it is owned by its officers.
