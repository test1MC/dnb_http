   Nature's Bounty (formerly NBTY) draws upon nature's bounty to cash in on the market for preventive and alternative health care. As the largest vertically integrated source of nutritional supplements in the US, the company manufactures, wholesales, and retails more than 16,000 products including vitamins, minerals, herbs, and sports drinks. Brands include Ester-C, Nature's Bounty, Balance Bar, Solgar, and Sundown. Nature's Bounty has manufacturing facilities in Canada, China, the UK, and the US, and is able to produce and package capsules, tablets, powders, and liquids.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2015 (ended September), the company restructured its reporting segments into four units: Consumer Products, Holland &amp; Barrett International, Puritan's Pride, and Vitamin World (which it subsequently sold in February 2016). The largest segment, Consumer Products, sells products worldwide under a number of brands, including third-party private labels. It accounts for more than half of the group's total revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Holland &amp; Barrett International (accounting for about 30% of sales) operates more than 800 Holland &amp; Barrett stores, primarily in the UK and Ireland, as well as more than 200 De Tuinen, Essenza, and GNC/Met-RX stores in Europe. The two smaller segments, which account for less than 10% of earnings each, are Puritan's Pride (which markets its namesake products online and via mail-order catalogues) and the former Vitamin World (which operates some 385 retail Vitamin World locations in the US) segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unlike many of its competitors that rely upon third-party manufacturers, the company actually manufactures 90% of the nutritional supplements that it sells and also serves as a third-party manufacturer of private-label products for a broad range of retailers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In the US the company has manufacturing plants in Arizona, California, Florida, New Jersey, New York, and North Carolina. Internationally, it has plants in Winnipeg and Manitoba in Canada, and in China and the UK. Nature's Bounty's products are marketed and sold in approximately 100 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US accounts for around 60% of Nature's Bounty's revenues. The UK is its second-largest market, representing 25%.

  <p>
   The company wholesales its products to all major mass merchandisers, club stores, drug store chains, and supermarkets. It also sells its products to independent pharmacies, health food stores, the military, and other retailers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nature's Bounty markets its products through print, media, and cooperative advertising and also through radio, television and internet advertising. In the UK and Ireland, Holland &amp; Barrett advertises on television. Holland &amp; Barrett, GNC (UK) and Nature's Way advertise in national newspapers and conduct sales promotions. In addition, Holland &amp; Barrett, GNC (UK) and De Tuinen each publish their own magazine with articles and promotional materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   Solgar and GNC (UK) advertise in magazines and conducts sales promotions. In Canada, SISU advertises in trade journals and magazines. Vita Health advertises in newspapers, trade publications and magazines, and operates websites.

  <p>
   Nature's Bounty has seen slow growth over the last five years. Revenues increased 1% in fiscal 2015 (ended September) to peak at $3.23 billion, versus $3.21 billion in fiscal 2014. That growth was driven by an increase in the Holland &amp; Barrett segment (which saw higher sales
   <em>
    and
   </em>
   a boost from positive currency exchange rates), but was partially offset by a decline in the Vitamin World segment, as weight-loss product sales dropped. The Puritan's Pride and Consumer Products segment remained flat that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   After falling into the red in 2014, with a $44 million net loss, the company returned to profitability in 2015. It posted $74 million in net income that year, primarily due to the absence of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges that had impacted the group in 2014. That in turn helped cash flow from operations, which jumped 183% to $290 million.
  </p>

  <p>
   Spotting trends early and riding them wisely is crucial in the nutritional supplement industry. While the company keeps an eye out for new products, in recent years it hasn't spent much on research and development, preferring instead to simply acquire or copy products with proven sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nature's Bounty has grown big and strong as the entire natural products industry has boomed, but a steady diet of acquisitions has supplemented its growth. Since 1986, the company has acquired more than 30 smaller businesses, which has expanded its product portfolio, geographic presence, and distribution network. In 2015, for example, it bought Dr. Organic for $85 million. That purchase spurred its entry into the mass-market beauty and skincare markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's sales are still heavily concentrated in the US and UK. It has plans to deepen its presence in emerging international markets where the growing amount of consumer income can be used to alleviate nutritional deficiencies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm changed its name from NBTY to Nature's Bounty in late 2016; the change reflected its growth as a wellness company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year, the company sold its Vitamin World business to investment firm Centre Lane Partners for $25 million. That divestiture allows Nature's Bounty to focus on its growing Holland &amp; Barrett operations.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2013 the company acquired Belgian firm Essenza, which operates more than a dozen retail stores, for some $4 million.
  </p>

  <p>
   Arthur Rudolph founded NBTY in his garage in the early 1960s. Then called Nature's Bounty, the company went public in 1971 to market nutritional supplements. Rudolph was chairman and CEO until his 1993 resignation, when son Scott succeeded him.
  </p>
  <p>
   Without so much as a glass of water, Nature's Bounty swallowed the mail-order business of General Nutrition Companies in 1989, and vitamin distributor Prime Natural Health Laboratories in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 the company agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it made deceptive claims about the effectiveness of 26 nutrient supplements. That year Nature's Bounty changed its name to that of its stock symbol, NBTY (the symbol changed to NTY in 2003 when the company moved to the NYSE).
  </p>
  <p>
   NBTY bought leading UK health foods chain Holland &amp; Barrett, which operated more than 400 stores, in 1997. The acquisition more than doubled its store count. After the buy, NBTY started stocking Holland &amp; Barrett's shelves with its products. In 1998 the company bought a group of privately held vitamin companies and made a major push to open more Vitamin World stores in the US. In 1999 NBTY acquired Nutrition Warehouse, further bolstering its retail, e-commerce, and mail-order operations. Also that year it bought network marketer Dynamic Essentials to broaden its distribution channels.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions continued into the 21st century: SDV Vitamins, a division of Rexall Sundown, joined the family in 2000, and in 2001 NBTY bought the Knox NutraJoint and Knox for Nails nutritional supplement business from
   <company id="103392">
    Kraft Foods
   </company>
   for about $4 million, along with NatureSmart from
   <company id="10952">
    Whole Foods Market
   </company>
   . The company's Holland &amp; Barrett subsidiary bought a chain of 12 vitamin retail stores (Nature's Way) in Ireland. To expand its wholesale business, NBTY in 2002 purchased a line of nutritional supplements sold under the Synergy Plus trademark, a well-known brand among health food aficionados.
  </p>
  <p>
   A big move came in 2003. NBTY bought
   <company id="17069">
    Rexall Sundown
   </company>
   from
   <company id="91334">
    Royal Numico N.V.
   </company>
   that year. Also in 2003 the company disbanded its Dynamic Essentials subsidiary after receiving a letter of inquiry by the FTC regarding a weight-loss product marketed by Dynamic Essentials. In addition, the company ceased production of all weight-loss products that contained ephedra, prior to the FDA's eventual ban on the herb.
  </p>
  <p>
   The highly acquisitive company bought up premium-brand supplement maker
   <company id="131694">
    Solgar Vitamin and Herb
   </company>
   (2005), and Zila Nutraceuticals (2006, formerly a division of
   <company id="46690">
    Zila
   </company>
   ). Zila Nutraceuticals was then renamed The Ester-C Company to reflect the business' primary product. In 2008 the company bought the assets of
   <company id="57421">
    Leiner Health Products
   </company>
   , a bankrupt maker of nutritional supplements and over-the-counter drugs, for $371 million. That purchase brought increased manufacturing capacity to support further growth.
