   SIG SAUER believes in giving customers its best shot. The company makes and imports SIG SAUER handguns and SIG firearms accessories and sells apparel, knives, and instructional DVDs. The gun manufacturer also operates the New Hampshire-based SIG SAUER Academy, which provides indoor and outdoor firearms-related training specific to armed professionals in law enforcement, the military, security, or correctional operations. The academy also serves private citizens. SIG SAUER's customer base includes law enforcement, the military, and individuals. The company derives its name from Swiss gun maker Schweizerische Industrie-Gesellschaft (or SIG) and German rifle and pistol manufacturer J.P. Sauer &amp; Sohn.

  <p>
   SIG SAUER is the largest company in a global group of firearm makers that includes J.P. Sauer &amp; Sohn and Blaser Gmbh in Germany and Swiss Arms AG in Switzerland.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company moved into its new corporate headquarters and production facility in Newington, New Hampshire, in 2014. The remodeled 206,000-sq.-ft. facility boosts SIG SAUER's manufacturing capacity and gives corporate staff more elbow room. The head office is near the Exeter, New Hampshire, manufacturing facility and the Epping, New Hampshire, training academy.

  <p>
   This network of both German and Swiss companies gives SIG SAUER advantages over rivals, as the guns maker has access to a worldwide base of firearms knowledge and design expertise, as well as to an extensive manufacturing capacity. It helps SIG SAUER ink lucrative deals with the US military. The gun maker was awarded a $5 million federal contract in 2011 by the Department of the Navy for weapons.
  </p>
  <p>
   SIG SAUER works to regularly roll out new products to keep its portfolio fresh. In 2014 the company launched the SIG SAUER P232-22, a pistol with American magazine release, external slide stop, threaded barrel, and ambidextrous manual safety, as well as a new line of Carbon Fiber Rifles in the SIG516 and SIGM400 platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
   Partnerships are key in extending SIG SAUER's reach. In 2013 the company formed an alliance with Lancer Systems, which designed and developed a hybrid magazine and carbon fiber handguard exclusively for the new SIG MPX submachine gun. The hybrid magazine is both lightweight and durable.

  <p>
   SIG was founded in Switzerland in 1853. More than a century later, it formed US company SIGARMS in 1995 to better serve the American market. In 2007, SIGARMS changed its name to SIG SAUER, reflecting the growing popularity of the SIG SAUER line of firearms.
