  <p>
   Mohawk generates around 70% of its revenues in North America. It has manufacturing facilities located in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, and the US.

  <p>
   Mohawk works through three main business segments: Flooring North America (45% of total sales); Global Ceramic (37%); and Flooring Rest of World (18%). Once focused exclusively on carpets and rugs, Mohawk has evolved, adapting itself to changing customer tastes and spending habits. The company now offers popular alternatives to carpet such as hardwood, laminate, and ceramic tile. It has also reached outside of its premium-priced portfolio by rolling out a do-it-yourself flooring line that mimics the elegant look of materials like marble or limestone, without the coldness, chipping, or costly installation of real stone.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its breadth of operations is matched by its depth; Mohawk maintains a strong distribution and wide customer base (in addition to residential customers, it serves government, healthcare, and educational institutions, as well as corporate, retail, and public venues), which creates strong brand recognition.

  <p>
   The company's top 10 customers accounted for nearly 20% of its total sales in 2015. It sells its products to more than 28,000 customers, which include independent floor covering retailers, home centers, and mass merchandisers, department stores, commercial dealers, and end users.

  <p>
   Mohawk has experienced several straight years of unprecedented growth. Its revenues were up by 3% from $7.8 billion in 2014 to peak at $8.1 billion in 2015, its highest total in at least seven years. Profits also jumped 16% from $532 million in 2014 to $615 million in 2015 mainly due to a decline in interest expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The growth for 2015 was fueled by an 11% surge in soft surface products, offset by a 2% dip in laminate and wood products sales. Mohawk was also helped by strong residential channel growth and continued improvement in the commercial channel.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's operating cash flow has surged the last few years. After increasing 26% in 2014, cash flow climbed by 38% in 2015 due to favorable changes in inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses.

  <p>
   The company is looking to extend its international reach and augment its product portfolio through acquisitions. In 2015 the company acquired International Flooring Systems S.A., a global manufacturer, distributor, and marketer of vinyl flooring products, for $1.1 billion. The acquisition will expand Mohawk's luxury vinyl tile category portfolio and its fiberglass sheet vinyl business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year, the company acquired Advent KAI Luxembourg Holdings, an eastern European ceramic tile floor manufacturer for $195 million; and Xtratherm Limited, an Ireland-based manufacturer of insulation boards in Ireland, the UK, and Belgium for $160 million.

  <p>
   Mohawk traces its origins to the Shuttleworth family who founded the company in Amsterdam, New York, in 1878, setting up their business with 14 second-hand looms imported from England. The company was incorporated as Shuttleworth Brothers in 1902. It introduced the popular Karnak carpet design in 1908.
