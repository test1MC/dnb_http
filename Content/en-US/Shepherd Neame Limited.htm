   Considered Britain's oldest brewer, Shepherd Neame is still hopping. It began as a brewery and pub operator in Faversham in 1698. The company has grown to run some 340 pubs and hotels in Kent, London, Sussex, Essex, and Surrey, including Camden Arms Hotel. In addition to meals, its offerings include ales and lagers brewed for the local market. Among many, its recognized brands include Spitfire, Bishops Finger, and Master Brew. Shepherd Neame also makes foreign brands under license: Sam Adams from the US and Asahi Super Dry from Japan. It offers private label wine and spirit brands through Todd's The Wine Company. The Neame family owns a controlling stake in the company.

  <p>
   Shepherd Neame's pubs are a mixture of 286 tenanted and 52 managed operations. The company also owns unlicensed properties and small landholdings; the largest is the 44-acre residual holding of the Queen Court farm in Ospringe near Faversham.

  <p>
   Nearly 230 of the company's pubs are in Kent with others in East Sussex, London, Surrey, Essex, Middlesex, Berkshire, Hampshire, and West Sussex.

  <p>
   Shepherd Neame's revenue dropped a narrow 0.3% in 2015 (ended June) from 2014. The decline reflected the company's phased exit from its contract to sell Jamaica's Kingfisher beer.

   The company continued a string of net income increases with a healthy 17% rise in 2015 from 2014. Reduced operating expenses helped push profit higher.

  <p>
   Shepherd Neame might be the oldest brewer in Britain, but it keeps up to date with digital and social media marketing to bring people to its pubs for a pint or more. It also seeks to diversify its revenue stream with investments in accommodations and food. An example is the Â£2.4 million in spent in refurbishing the Royal Wells Hotel in Tunbridge Wells. The company's Whitstable line of ales has done well with a volume increase of nearly 40% in 2015.
