   Inovio Pharmaceuticals is electrifying its vaccine delivery process. The firm's needle-free electroporation infusion therapy uses electrical pulses to open up cell membranes, thus optimizing the delivery of its DNA vaccines that can protect from cancers as well as chronic infectious diseases including HIV and hepatitis C. Its SynCon process identifies shared characteristics among different strains of similar viruses to help develop a universal flu vaccine that will be effective on most influenza strains, unlike traditional flu vaccines that are strain-specific. It also has a couple of anti-inflammatory drugs in its pipeline and some DNA-based animal growth hormones for livestock.

   Inovio's synthetic immunotherapy technology platform is increasingly promising as a new way to prevent and treat cancers and infectious diseases, as evidenced by successes from its phase II cervical dysplasia study. The company has completed, is currently in, or plans clinical programs of its proprietary SynCon immunotherapies for HPV-casued cancers and other diseases.

   The company derived 70% of its 2014 revenues from Roche and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).

   Revenues have fluctuated over the past five years. It nearly tripled in 2013, primarily due to Inovio's collaboration with Roche. Revenue fell 22% to $10.4 million in 2014, as collaborative R&amp;D arrangements declined. This was largely due to the termination of an agreement with Roche to co-develop INO-5150 and research treatments for prostate cancer. Additionally, less revenue from its contract with NIAID came in due to the timing of work performed.

  <p>
   Net income took a huge dip in 2013 as the company took a loss on its investment in an affiliated entity. Net loss decreased 45% to $36 million in 2014. Cash outflow, which has also fluctuated, increased 94% to $30 million as less cash was generated from accounts payable.

   Inovio is working on expanding its HPV portfolio and has launched a compassionate phase I clinical trial for patients with HPV-caused aerodigestive cancer.

   The company also seeks to add to its partnership agreements. In 2014 it added to its agreement with the

   In 2014 Inovio acquired the worldwide rights, excluding China, for early preclinical therapies for Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis based on the academic research of Shanghai professor Dr. Bin Wang.

  <p>
   Two years later, the company acquired the needle-free jet injection technology assets of BioJect Medical Technologies for $4.3 million. Those technologies will allow for advances in immunotherapy and vaccine delivery as well as reduce the amount of disposable materials in delivery. They will complement Inovio's existing needle-free electroporation systems in development.
