   The images that Silicon Image's chips convey are seen on screens large and small. The company designs and sells a variety of integrated circuits, including digital video controllers, receivers, transmitters, and processors that are built into mobile devices, digital TVs, camera, personal computers, and DVD and Blu-ray players. Silicon Image helped create HDMI and DVI industry standards, as well as MHL, the standard for mobile devices, and the 60GHz wireless HD video standard, WirelessHD. Through subsidiary Simplay Labs, it offers HDMI licensing and compliance testing services. Customers located outside the US account for about 60% of sales. Silicon Image was acquired by
   <company id="11898">
    Lattice Semiconductor
   </company>
   in early 2015.

  <p>
   Silicon Image outsources production to
   <company id="43493">
    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
   </company>
   . The company's only real estate consists of sales offices in China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the US (in California) and R&amp;D centers in China and India.
  </p>
  <p>
   Customers in Asia account for about half of sales; those in the US make up about 40% of sales.

   Silicon Image uses both a direct sales force and distributors to sell its products. Its top customer is
   <company id="55277">
    Samsung Electronics
   </company>
   , which accounts for 29% of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Silicon Image's mobile business was about 39% in 2014, down from 54% in 2013. The consumer electronics and PC markets were 33% (23% in 2013) and 5% of 2014 revenue.

  <p>
   Sales fell 6% in 2014 to $258 million as sales for its mobile and PC products shrunk from 2013. Mobile ales tumbled 33% because of slowdown from one major customer. PC-oriented products were 3% lower on the general softness in worldwide PC sales. A 266% increase in net income to $42.1 million in 2014 was due to lower expenses, the sale of investments, and tax benefits. Cash flow maintained a steady pace of $40 million in 2014 from $39 million in 2013.

   Silicon Image is looking to MHL to boost its licensing revenues, as HDMI did in the past. With a wide variety of consumer electronics manufacturers supporting the High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) industry standard, Silicon Image has had more than 500 companies license the technology from another subsidiary, HDMI Licensing.

   Silicon Image spent $13.5 million in 2014 to buy the nearly 80% it didn't own of UpdateLogic Inc., a privately held company headquartered in Minneapolis. ULI's product was a device management system for Internet-connected consumer electronics products including digital TVs, Blu-ray Disc players, set-top boxes, and gaming consoles.
