   Thanks to Barry Callebaut, all is well in the world (of chocolate). The Swiss company is a global maker and supplier of cocoa and industrial chocolate. It caters to food manufacturers and, less so, boutique chocolate-makers, pastry chefs, and haute chocolatiers. Callebaut's offerings include bulk chocolate, compounds (non-chocolate product replacements), inclusions (for adding taste and texture to chocolate dishes), cocoa products, decorations, and fillings. For gourmet and specialty businesses, Callebaut produces premium chocolate products, sold under brand names Callebaut, Cacao Barry, and other labels, and beverage blends, mainly under Caprimo and Van Houten. Europe accounts for roughly 40% of all sales.

   To increase its exposure in the world's largest market for chocolate, Callebaut in mid-2015 announced it would buy the production assets of World's Finest Chocolate, best known for supply school fund raising sales. The deal includes a long-term agreement for Callebaut to supply all the chocolate for World's Finest products.

   The chocolate maker's activities got their start in 1996 through the merger of Belgium's Callebaut and French company, Cacao Barry. The family of founder, the late Klaus Jacobs, continues to hold majority control of Barry Callebaut.

   Acquisitions have always played an important part in Callebaut's growth. In 2002 it bought the Stollwerck Group (Germany, consumer chocolates sold under the Jacques brand), and the following year it bought up Brach's Confections (US, consumer confections). Continuing to look for acquisitions in the premium and specialty chocolate sector, in 2004 the company acquired AM Foods (vending consumer chocolates) from Danish company,
   <company id="105475">
    Arla Foods
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to supply the growing demand on the US's West Coast, in 2005 it spent $20 million on a new chocolate factory in California.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company began building new plant in Russia in 2006 and opened sales offices in Chicago and Shanghai that year as well. It also extended its contract manufacturing services, now offering full-service confectionery production (recipe to wrapping) for third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an effort to combat dropping sales due to the public's image that chocolate is not a healthful food, in 2007 the company introduced a chocolate bar containing probiotics. Probiotics are micro-organisms (
   <em>
    i.e.
   </em>
   , bacteria) that are thought to restore the pH balance of the intestines, which the company claims provide "protection against infection while improving metabolism."
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its plans for expansion in the Asian market, the company formed an alliance with Japanese confectioner
   <company id="56831">
    Morinaga
   </company>
   in 2007 wherein Callebaut supplies Morinaga with liquid chocolate for a ten-year term; in addition, Callebaut acquired production facilities from Morinaga, doubling its Japanese manufacturing capacity.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007, Callebaut sold
   <company id="59632">
    Brach's
   </company>
   to US non-chocolate candy maker,
   <company id="117773">
    Farley's &amp; Sathers
   </company>
   . Callebaut had acquired Brach's in order to enter the US market and to also manufacture private-label chocolate for the US. However, the US market for private-label products did not develop in the way the company had hoped. Therefore, Callebaut decided to concentrate on other priorities such as outsourcing and geographical expansion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later that year, the company announced a long-term supply agreement with
   <company id="41815">
    Nestlé
   </company>
   to supply the candy giant with its yearly supply of liquid chocolate. At the same time, Callebaut agreed to produce some of Nestlé's consumer products. The agreement is an example of the outsourcing trend taking place throughout the confectionary sector.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also has a long-term supply and R&amp;D agreement with Hershey wherein Callebaut supplies Hershey's Mexican production plant with 80,000 tonnes (about 89 US tons) of chocolate per year. In order to meet this increase in demand, Callebaut built a plant in Mexico. The two companies also combined their R&amp;D operations in the areas of new flavors, premium chocolate, ingredients, and heath and wellness.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its change in focus from making consumer chocolate to supplying ingredients, in 2009 the company sold Van Houten Singapore to the
   <company id="10722">
    Hershey
   </company>
   company. The deal allowed Callebaut focus on business-to-business demand in the region. Callebaut retained ownership of the Van Houten brand and granted Hershey an exclusive license for Van Houten's consumer products in the Asia/Pacific region, the Middle East, and Australia and New Zealand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Callebaut acquired its Spanish rival, Chocovic, from the Nederland Group in 2009. One-hundred-thirty-year-old Chocovic specializes in chocolate and specialty products for industrial and artisanal customers; it also owns Aula Chocovic, a chocolate academy which trains professional chocolatiers. The acquisition was in line with Callebaut's strategy to expand it non-consumer/retail business and its geographic presence. In order to add to its holdings in the European vending-mix sector, Callebaut acquired Eurogran in 2009, as well. Located in Denmark, Eurogran makes vending mixes for cappuccino and chocolate drinks.
