   In fiscal 2015 (ended March), revenue increased 6% to 102.8 billion rupees on higher product sales. The company's export initiative and scrap sales also contributed to the increase. However, net income fell 15% to 11.8 billion rupees due to higher cost of materials and employee benefits.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations fell 5% to 10.5 billion rupees as more cash was used in inventories and trade.

  <p>
   The company has been busy inking deals to push for further growth. It has recently established subsidiaries in Sri Lanka and Morocco and has set up teams in Myanmar, Nepal, Malaysia, and other markets. It also plans to invest heavily (up to Â£100 million) in its UK subsidiary over the next few years; the unit established a joint venture with Cooper Pharma and The Pharmaceutical Institute in 2015 that will focus on respiratory and neurology products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other key strategic focus areas include building up its pipeline portfolio, strengthening its manufacturing operations and supply chain, and simplifying its organization (including processes and systems). In fiscal 2015 the company's flagship product, salmeterol-fluticasone, was introduced into the markets in Croatia, Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Belgium, and Hungary. Also that year Cipla in-licensed darbepoetin; it launched the generic drug sofusbuvir (for the treatment of hepatitis C) in India under the brand name HepCvir. It established a marketing partnership with BioQuiddity for post-surgical pain management treatment OneDose ReadyfusOR, and its European division signed a distribution agreement with Serum Institute of India to market pediatric flu vaccines in Europe.

   During fiscal 2015, Cipla received approvals for some of its respiratory pipeline in Europe. In the US, it gained approval for Lopinavir oral pellets for pediatric-specific treatment in infants.
