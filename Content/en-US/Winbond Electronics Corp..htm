   Thomas Carlyle said, "A mystic bond of brotherhood makes all men one." We say, "A Winbond of Taiwan makes all sorts of semiconductors." Winbond Electronics produces a broad range of integrated circuits (ICs) -- data communication, memory, microcontroller, multimedia, PC, speech, telephony, visual communication -- that are used in devices such as computers, cell phones, cameras, and DVD players. The company's silicon foundry services include circuit design, testing, and packaging. Pain for the Taiwan Company has increased as prices and demand for its dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips have plunged.

  <p>
   Winbond Electronics began construction of its first silicon foundry in 1987, the year it was established by Taiwanese holding company Walsin Lihwa. By the following year the company had commenced operations and produced its first semiconductor wafers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1989 Winbond introduced its first integrated circuit (IC) for voice applications and began construction of a second foundry. Winbond further expanded in 1990 with new operations in Hong Kong and the US. The company's second foundry was up and running by 1992 and construction started on a third foundry in 1995, the year Winbond went public.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 1995 Winbond bought out its affiliate Symphony Laboratories (chipset manufacturing) as part of a strategy to move away from memory products toward high-end ICs for the communications market. Contrary to this strategy, the company subsequently reached a licensing agreement to design memory chips for Toshiba -- a move that marked the beginning of a long relationship with the Japanese giant.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Winbond formed an alliance with Information Storage Devices (ISD) to produce voice recording integrated circuits, and the following year it acquired ISD. Also in 1998 Winbond formed two joint ventures with Toshiba -- HannStar Display (LCDs) and Walton Advanced Electronics (memory testing and packaging).
  </p>
  <p>
   Winbond saw a changing of the guard late in 1998 when EVP C. C. Chang succeeded longtime president D. Y. Yang, who became vice chairman of the company. The management succession paled in comparison to the disruption experienced the following year. Winbond was among many companies that sustained damage during a massive 1999 earthquake in Taiwan.
  </p>
  <p>
   While posting record sales, Winbond came out on the short end of two legal battles in 2000. An investigation begun in 1996 finally ended in 2000 when the International Trade Commission found that Winbond infringed on patents held by competitor
   <company id="14420">
    Atmel
   </company>
   . Winbond also settled in an intellectual property case brought by
   <company id="47103">
    Silicon Storage Technology
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Late in 2001 Toshiba announced that it would exit the commodity DRAM market; the move reinforced Winbond's stated intention to refocus its efforts away from the volatile DRAM business in favor of other, more stable product areas, such as flash memory and logic chips. The next year, however, Winbond also announced a DRAM supply agreement with Infineon Technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the beginning of 2002, D. Y. Yang retired as vice chairman. Later that year Winbond retired its first wafer fabrication facility, which had made ICs on silicon wafers measuring 125mm across. The company established a new R&amp;D group in 2003 with three technology centers: the Memory Technology Center, the Emerging Technology Center, and the Novel Device Structure Center.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Winbond broke ground on its 300mm wafer fab at the Central Taiwan Science Park in Taichung. The following year the company began production at the Taichung fab. Winbond acquired NexFlash Technologies, a supplier of specialty flash memory devices, and the Advanced PC division of
   <company id="11058">
    National Semiconductor
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2005 Winbond adopted a new senior management structure, setting up a formal management succession at the same time. Arthur Y. C. Chiao, the chairman of Walsin Lihwa and CEO of Walsin Group, added the post of CEO to his chairmanship of Winbond. President C. C. Chang was promoted to vice chairman and deputy CEO. I. S. Hsu, the VP/GM of the Logic IC Business Group, was elevated to president and COO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2006 Winbond Electronics sold its flat-panel display business to spinoff Cheertek Technology for around NT$400 million ($12.5 million). The display driver IC business had produced NT$1.4 billion (nearly $43 million) in sales during 2005, but management perceived little synergy between the product and other lines in the company's Logic IC Business Group.
