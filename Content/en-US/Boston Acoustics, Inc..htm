   on a set of Boston Acoustics' speakers and you'll see the light. The company designs and makes moderately priced and high-end loudspeaker systems for the home and automotive markets. It also makes home entertainment systems, amplifiers, and ancillary speaker equipment, including selectors and volume controls. Boston Acoustics mostly tunes out mass retailers, selling its products through a select group of specialty dealers. Its products are manufactured by third parties in the Asia/Pacific region, Europe, and North America. Former chairman Andrew Kotsatos and ex-CEO Frank Reed founded the company in 1979.

   Frank Reed and Andrew Kotsatos, who left speaker manufacturer Advent with the idea of establishing a company that would provide high-quality loudspeaker systems at competitive prices, founded Boston Acoustics in 1979. The company introduced its first automotive speaker product in 1984 and went public in 1986.
  </p>
  <p>
   Boston Acoustics replaced its older line of bookshelf speakers, the HD series, with the four-model Compact Reference (CR) Series in 1994. The CR Series was the company's first complete line compatible with all home entertainment and computer multimedia systems. In 1995 Boston Acoustics continued to improve the award-winning Lynnfield Series (used in music and home theater systems) by introducing the $2,000 to $5,000 Lynnfield II and the more affordable Lynnfield VR Series.
  </p>
  <p>
   A steady flow of innovative products, targeted advertising in audio journals, enthusiastic product reviews, and industry awards helped boost the company's sales after several years of relatively flat growth. In 1995 Boston Acoustics built a 150,000-sq.-ft. plant and office building in Peabody, Massachusetts.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired
   <company id="55776">
    Snell Acoustics
   </company>
   in 1996. Boston Acoustics CEO, Reed, died that year; Kotsatos took over the position. Boston Acoustics entered the computer audio market in 1997 with an agreement to supply
   <company id="16706">
    Gateway
   </company>
   with speakers for its computers, giving Gateway warrants to buy a small stake in the company in exchange.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the company acquired its German distributor, Audiomax. It also struck a deal to service the international markets of
   <company id="61573">
    Parasound Products
   </company>
   , an audio component manufacturer. In 1999 Boston Acoustics began selling some of its products through
   <company id="15490">
    CompUSA
   </company>
   , the US's largest computer retailer. In 2000 a decline in the sales of high-end computers led to a corresponding drop in Boston Acoustics' sales; the company responded by cutting its workforce by 25% in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   In August 2005 D&amp;M Holdings acquired Boston Acoustics.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-December 2008 D&amp;M Holdings combined the sales and marketing operations of Boston Acoustics with its Denon subsidiary in the US under a single management team in a bid to reduce costs.
