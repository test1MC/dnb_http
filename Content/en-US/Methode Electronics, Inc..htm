   When it comes to making gear for manufacturers, there's no madness in Methode Electronics' methods. Methode produces a wide variety of components, especially electronic connectors and controls, that are used by automotive manufacturers (products made for
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10640">
    GM
   </company>
   together account for more than half of sales) and in computers, communications equipment, industrial systems, aircraft and spacecraft, and consumer electronics. It also makes electrical bus systems and radio remote controls, among other products.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Methode Electronics divides its business into three segments: automotive (76% of sales), interface (17% of sales), and power products (7% of sales).
  </p>
  <p>
   Automotive devices include control switches for electrical power and signals, connectors for electrical devices, integrated control components, and switches and sensors that monitor components or systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The interface segment provides copper and fiber-optic interconnect and interface products such as connectors, custom cable assemblies, industrial safety radio remote controls, and optical and copper transceivers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The power products segment manufactures braided flexible cables, current-carrying laminated bus devices, custom power-product assemblies, high-current low voltage flexible power cabling systems, and powder coated bus bars.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company makes its products in factories in China, Egypt, Malta, and Mexico.

  <p>
   About 61% of Methode's revenue comes from the US, home to its two biggest customers. Malta generates 21% and China, 15%.
  </p>

  <p>
   Methode Electronics uses a direct sales force that works with customers to design custom-engineered and application-specific products. For certain automotive products, the company distributes products to suppliers of automotive OEMs. As noted, Methode's two biggest customers, either directly or through suppliers, account for about 50% and 11% of revenue.
  </p>

  <p>
   Methode's revenue slid 8% to $809 million in 2016 (ended in April) from 2014. Automotive sales dropped as the Ford Center Console program substantially completed production by the end 2016. But the biggest decrease was Power Products for which sales dropped 38%, wiping out $32 million revenue. The segments North American sales were hurt by fewer sales of PowerRail products and in Europe by lower sales of a bypass switch.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profit, which had risen for several years in a row, suffered with a 16% drop to $84.6 million in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities fell 10% to $110.7 million in 2016 from 2015.

   Methode sold its Trace Laboratories unit, which offered electrical, environmental, and other industrial testing services, to
   <company id="14217">

   </company>
   for $11.7 million in 2015 to better focus on its core businesses.

  <p>
   William McGinley started Methode in 1947 to produce vacuum tube sockets for portable radios. Methode began making printed circuits for radios in 1952. During the early 1960s it supplied circuits for color TVs made by RCA. The rising dominance of Asian electronics manufacturers during the 1970s inspired Methode to turn to the nascent computer market for customers; it made electronic connectors for mainframe and midrange computers. During the 1980s the company began developing network products and fiber-optic connectors.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 Methode sold its automotive test equipment subsidiary to focus on interconnect products. That year the company began a prolonged acquisition drive when it bought Mikon Ltd., a UK-based supplier of fiber-optic cable assemblies and components. In 1994 Methode acquired
   <company id="12289">
    Rogers Corp.
   </company>
   's power distribution business. The next year it bought Duel Systems, a maker of sonic-welded PC memory cards, and two cable manufacturing operations from ETOS Fujikura.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's 1997 acquisitions included Merit Elektrik, a Malta-based maker of automotive switches, and Magnetoelastic Devices, a research company with a passive transducer patent. In 1998 Methode bought Stratos Ltd., a UK-based maker of fiber-optic connectors for harsh environments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Methode sold its printed circuit board operations in 1999. The company acquired network component maker Polycore Technologies and the optoelectronics division of
   <company id="14775">
    Spire Corporation
   </company>
   that year. In 2000 Methode spun off most of its optical components business as Stratos Lightwave, retaining an 84% stake. (Stratos Lightwave later became
   <company id="100687">
    Stratos International
   </company>
   and was acquired in 2007 by
   <company id="10514">
    Emerson Electric
   </company>
   .)
  </p>
  <p>
   After more than 50 years at the helm of his company, William McGinley died in 2001 at the age of 77. William Jensen, a 45-year veteran of the company, was named chairman, while EVP Donald Duda became president. Also that year the company distributed its remaining stake in Stratos to shareholders.
  </p>
  <p>
   With a stagnant economy in the early 21st century putting pressure on revenue growth, Methode consolidated some of its manufacturing facilities to control costs and increase margins. In 2003 Methode acquired its longtime automotive products distributor, Kill &amp; Bolton Associates.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Duda was named CEO. Later the same year Jensen retired as chairman and director Warren Batts (retired chairman and CEO of
   <company id="48028">
    Tupperware Brands
   </company>
   ) was tapped to replace him. Also that year Methode acquired and then retired about two-thirds of the Class B shares owned by the estate and survivors of company founder William McGinley, and agreed to buy the rest. Despite efforts by
   <company id="46442">
    Dura Automotive Systems
   </company>
   to purchase the remaining Class B shares in a hostile bid for control of Methode, the merger of Class A and Class B shares was approved by Methode shareholders.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired Cableco Technologies, a manufacturer of high-current, flexible cabling systems for electronic and electrical power applications, in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Methode acquired
   <company id="118396">
    TouchSensor Technologies
   </company>
   from Gemtron Corporation for $65 million. TouchSensor supplied solid-state, field-effect switches used in automobiles, beverage dispensers, and home appliances, among other applications. The acquisition helped the company diversify into a variety of consumer products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company acquired the assets of radio remote control manufacturer, Hetronic. The deal, worth nearly $54 million in cash, included operations in Germany, Malta, the Philippines, and the US. Hetronic was incorporated into Methode's Interconnect segment. The deal expanded Methode's reach in the human/machine interface market. That year Methode also restructured operations at three of its US plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   The global automotive industry had one of its worst years on record during Methode's fiscal 2009, due to the recession and credit crisis, and that dramatic downturn was reflected in the company's results. Sales were off by nearly 23% from the year before. In fiscal 2010 sales in the auto market continued to drop, by 18% over 2009, as the economy continued to slump.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales in North America, where the auto industry was particularly hard hit, led the decline. Sales to Ford were lower in 2010 due to Methode's decision to relocate business from its facility in Reynosa, Mexico, to other suppliers. Delphi, once a significant customer, terminated its supply agreement with Methode in 2009. Additionally, the company decided to exit the Chrysler business, which was completed during 2009. That year Methode restructured by consolidating manufacturing facilities in order to cut costs. Only its torque-sensing and testing businesses were spared.
