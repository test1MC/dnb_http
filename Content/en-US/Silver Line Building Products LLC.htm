   At Silver Line Building Products, when employees look out the window, they're not daydreaming -- it's their job! Silver Line is one of the largest manufacturers of vinyl windows in North America. It targets the new-construction and replacement markets with a range of designs, from double-hung and picture windows to custom-made octagonal and quarter-round window styles. It also makes acoustic and commercial windows and sliding-glass patio doors. Customers include building-supply stores, specialty window dealers, and lumberyards. Silver Line, which is owned by

   Working to reclaim sales lost to the recession in the building industry in recent years, Silver Line is emphasizing that its windows meet ENERGY STAR specifications for all 50 states. The ENERGY STAR program was developed by the
   <company id="138711">
    US Department of Energy
   </company>
   and the
   <company id="130205">
    US Environmental Protection Agency
   </company>
   to help consumers identify products that save energy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Silver Line also tests and certified its windows and patio doors to the National Fenestration Rating Council's standards for U-factor, solar heat gain coefficient, and visible transmittance. In 2013 the company launched a new line of LoE-LS glass for Southern areas, as well as windows and doors designed to withstand severe coastal weather conditions.
