   When Cranswick sets the table, hungry people show up. A major UK pork processor, the company sells fresh and processed pork products, such as sausage, cured bacon, and fresh deli and packaged meats under the Cranswick, Bodega, Berties Bangers, Simply Sausages, Weight Watchers, and Woodall's brands, among others. It also makes chilled pre-made sandwiches for the convenience food market, and offers private-label products and services. Long a household name in the European pet-goods market, Cranswick exited the pet business to focus on its pork-processing activities. Formed by farmers in the early 1970s to manufacture pig feed, the company later diversified to produce food for people and their pets.

  <p>
   The UK is North Hull-based Cranswick's largest market, accounting for 97% of its total sales. Continental Europe represents most of the rest.

  <p>
   Cranswick operates about a dozen plants across the UK that process pork and produce sausages, cured bacon, cooked meats, and sandwiches. It is also involved in pig rearing and several locations in England. The company also has a gourmet pastry business in North Yorkshire.

   Amid growing demand for its products, Cranswick reported sales of £875 million in fiscal 2013 (ended March), a 7% increase versus the prior year. (Sales growth in US dollars is lower due to currency translation.) Adjusted profit before tax was £49.3 million in fiscal 2013 compared with £45.6 million in 2012. Cranswick's sales have more than tripled over the past decade. Record high pig prices are impacting the company's profits.

  <p>
   Encouraged by growing demand for pork in the UK and seeking greater control over its pork supply, Cranswick has returned to pig rearing through several recent acquisitions. The vertically-integrated pork processor is focusing on premium, British born and bred pigs.

  <p>
   To that end, in April 2013 Cranswick acquired East Anglian Pigs (EAP), a key supplier to its operations in Norfolk. Post sale, EAP (since renamed Wayland Farms) continued as a separate operation with its own management.

  <p>
   In June 2012 Cranswick acquired Kingston Foods Ltd., a producer of premium cooked and roasted meats. The purchase bolstered the company's cooked meat production capabilities and further diversified its product offering in the growing market for cooked meats.
