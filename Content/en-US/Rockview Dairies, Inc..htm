   Got
   <em>
    organic
   </em>
   milk? Rockview Dairies does. Doing business as Rockview Farms, the company produces milk and other dairy products under brand names Rockview Farms and Good Heart Organic Milk. Bucking modern trends, the dairy owns its own farms and cows, which have not been treated with bovine growth hormones. Rockview Dairies processes, packages, and distributes its own milk. It also offers eggs, dressings, fruit drinks, and desserts. The company wholesales its products to food retailers and foodservice operators and, as a bonus, offers home-delivery service. Established in 1927 by Bob Hops, Rockview Dairies serves Southern California. It has been owned and operated by the DeGroot family since 1965.

   Thanks to a growing movement to eat local and organic foods, Rockview Dairies has developed a successful milk-delivery business. The dairy partners with delivery companies to deliver milk and other dairy products to more than 7,500 homes located in Los Angeles and Orange counties. Milk is delivered fewer than 48 hours after milking.

  <p>
   It has grown to become one of the largest dairies in the state to own its own cows and process, package, and distribute its own milk.
