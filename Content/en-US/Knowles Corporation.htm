   Knowles knows electrical products and components. Developing the microphone and receiver for hearing aids in 1954, Knowles Corporation continues to make those products, along with volume controls, trimmers, switches, telecoils, and other components used in aerospace, computer, instrumentation, medical, military, and telecommunications applications. The company also makes speakers and receivers used in mobile handsets, smartphones, and tablets. Its operations are divided across two segments: Mobile Consumer Electronics (MCE) and Specialty Components (SC).

  <p>
   For almost a decade, Knowles was owned by diversified manufacturing giant
   <company id="10470">
    Dover Corporation
   </company>
   . In 2014 Knowles was spun off as an independent, publicly traded company.

  <p>
   The company operates through nearly 45 locations and design centers in Europe, Asia, and North America. Asia generates around 70% of its total revenue, while the US and Europe account for 17% and 9%, respectively.

   Knowles targets the mobile consumer electronics, communications, medical, military, aerospace, and industrial markets. It sells its products directly to original equipment manufacturers and to their contract manufacturers and suppliers. It supplements its direct sales force with external sales representatives and distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 its top ten customers accounted for approximately 58% of its net revenue.
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   accounted for approximately 25% of its total revenue. Revenues from two customers of its MCE segment in 2015 represented approximately 41% and 13%, respectively, of its total segment revenues.

  <p>
   Knowles has experienced revenue declines and net losses over the last few years. From 2014 to 2015, revenues fell 5% from $1.14 billion to $1.08 billion, while its posted net losses of $87 million in 2014 and $234 million in 2015. In addition, its operating cash flow has dipped over the years, decreasing by $37 million from 2014 to 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The declines for 2015 were driven by a 4% decline in MCE sales and a 6% drop in SC sales. MCE revenues decreased due to lower average selling prices, a decrease in shipments to a Korean OEM customer (in connection with its lower share of the handset market), and softness at a major OEM customer in connection with its transition to a new operating system. SC revenues decreased in 2015 due to lower pricing and a reduction in timing device shipments in connection with a reduction in China LTE infrastructure build-outs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Knowles' most recent net loss was attributed to an impairment charge recorded for its speaker and receiver product line within its MCE business segment as it has concluded that the product line lacks a future path to profitability. In addition, the MCE and SC business segments recorded other impairment charges in connection with the company's restructuring actions.

   The company is looking to include its products into gaming applications for consumer and business handheld products, as well as in digital video and multifunction digital cameras, voice recognition systems, miniature implantable medical devices, and the newest iteration of smartphone and tablet products.
