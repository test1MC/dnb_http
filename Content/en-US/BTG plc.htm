   A specialist health care firm, BTG acquires patent rights to new technologies and licenses them to manufacturers around the globe. With a focus on biopharmaceuticals and medical products, BTG reviews prospective technologies developed by research institutions, universities, and companies around the globe. In addition, BTG helps raise venture capital for start-up businesses and creates ventures (often through partnerships) to exploit new technologies. Originally set up by the British government to protect and patent British inventions, BTG has helped bring to market such famous inventions as the hovercraft and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

  <p>
   The company has three primary operating segments: Interventional Medicine (oncology, vascular, and pulmonology products; 31% of revenue in 2014), Specialty Pharmaceuticals (antidote products; 33% of revenue), and Licensing (royalties from licensed assets; 36% of revenue). Interventional Medicine has a portfolio of treatments for liver tumors, severe blood clots, varicose veins, and advanced emphysema, while Specialty Pharmaceuticals products help patients who have been overexposed to certain toxins or medications.
  </p>
  <p>
   BTG also has one late-stage product under development (with partner Wellstat Therapeutics). Uridine triacetate is being explored as an antidote for overexposure to the chemotherapeutic 5-fluorouracil.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company receives royalties on products that are licensed to partners. Its largest source of royalty payments is prostate cancer drug Zytiga, which is sold by

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   BTG operates in Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia. The US accounts for some 90% of its total revenue.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company sells its products directly and through distribution agreements in the US, Europe, and the Asia/Pacific region. It has a direct sales force to sell polymer beads (used to treat liver tumors) in Taiwan.

  <p>
   BTG's revenue has grown for the past five years. In 2014 it rose 27% to £367.8 million as all segments grew. Interventional Medicine grew 42% that year, led by expansion in the US, which was primarily driven by sales in the TheraSphere division. Specialty Pharmaceuticals saw an 18% increase on sales of toxicity treatment DigiFab, and Licensing rose 26% on higher sales of Zytiga and Lemtrada (a treatment for multiple sclerosis).
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income also rose that year, climbing 38% to £33.6 million due to the higher revenue and lower acquisition and reorganization expenses. Cash flow from operations declined a marginal 2% to £47.5 million.

  <p>
   BTG grows both organically and through acquisitions. Its areas of focus include expanding the geographic availability of its products, developing new uses for existing products, and discovering new potential candidates. For example, in 2014 it gained approval in China for its DC Bead used in the treatment of hypervascularized tumors. In terms of acquisitions, the company seeks both interventional and specialty medications.
  </p>
  <p>
   It utilizes existing or creates new sales teams to sell newly acquired products. In 2014 it established a sales team to sell Varithena (a varicose vein treatment) in the US. It also expanded its European sales force that sells TheraSphere (radiation therapy for liver cancer) and DC Bead.

  <p>
   In early 2015 BTG acquired PneumRx, which makes treatments for advanced emphysema, for £153 million. Among its products are the RePneu Coil System, which is placed in a patient's lung to compress diseased tissue.

  <p>
   BTG traces its roots to the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC), which was started by the British government in 1949 to protect rights to British inventions developed with public funds. The NRDC was inspired, in part, by the experience of Alexander Fleming, who had discovered penicillin in 1928. Fleming never patented the drug, however, and US companies got the patent after finding a way to produce the drug profitably. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the NRDC was involved in the development of new pharmaceuticals and insecticides, most notably Cephalosporin (an antibiotic) and Pyrethrin (a synthetic version of an insecticide made from chrysanthemums), both of which were patented by the company in the 1970s.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1981 the NRDC merged with the National Enterprise Board to form the British Technology Group, which later officially shortened its name to BTG. (The government said at the time it planned to privatize the company as soon as possible; however, this wouldn't happen until 1992.) In 1984 BTG helped develop and patent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the diagnostic friend to injured athletes everywhere. Its patent on Cephalosporin expired in 1986. The next year BTG bought the traction control and transmission research arm of the Rover Group and named it
   <company id="100480">
    Torotrak
   </company>
   . BTG opened its first overseas office in the Philadelphia area in 1990. A management and employee buyout in 1992 made the company a private enterprise at last. BTG went public in 1995 -- the same year its patent for Pyrethrin expired.
  </p>
  <p>
   After auto manufacturers refused to produce Torotrak's improved transmission system, the company began to manufacture transmissions itself at great expense. This led to the 1998 spinoff of
   <company id="100480">
    Torotrak
   </company>
   as a public company. BTG began taking in revenue from a new pharmaceutical, a hemophilia B treatment based on blood clotting proteins, in 1999. Seeking to streamline and increase its ability to respond to the fast-moving technology fields, the company reorganized in 2000 by integrating its Medical and Physical Sciences division into two new divisions (Electronics, Engineering, and Information Technologies and Health, Medical, and Biological Sciences). It later formed a partnership with US-based
   <company id="57308">
    Information Holdings
   </company>
   to create PATEX, an online marketplace for buying and selling intellectual property.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 BTG launched KetoCytonyx, a company that develops treatments for neurological conditions such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease.
