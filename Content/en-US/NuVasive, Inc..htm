   When a back is seriously out of whack, NuVasive has some options. The company makes and markets medical devices for the surgical treatment of spinal disorders. NuVasive's products are primarily used in spinal restoration and fusion surgeries. Its minimally disruptive Maximum Access Surgery (MAS) platform enables surgeons to access the spine from the side of the body instead of from the front or back, helping them to avoid hitting nerves. NuVasive also features a line of biologic bone grafting materials -- both allograft and synthetic -- and has a cervical disc replacement system in development. The company sells its

   -approved products through a network of exclusive sales agents, supported by an in-house sales team.
  </p>

  <p>
   NuVasive offers more than 80 products for procedures in the lumbar, thoracic, and cervical regions, including the mesh, plates, screws, and biological implants used with its MAS system. Its Osteocel product is an adult stem-cell bone graft used for bone regeneration in orthopedic procedures and at one point was the only commercially available stem-cell product in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   NuVasive's revenues primarily come from the sale of disposable materials and implants. The full system of software and instruments are loaned to hospitals for free as long as they keep ordering disposables and implants, though a small portion of the company's revenues are from the sale of instruments and systems. Revenues from its monitoring services come from hospitals, and are also billed through various payers.
  </p>

  <p>
   NuVasive maintains a facility in California where it trains doctors in the use of its products. It ships its products directly to doctors overnight from a distribution facility in Tennessee; other US facilities are located in New Jersey, Ohio, and Maryland. International offices are located in Australia, Brazil, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, and the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US accounts for the majority of NuVasive's sales, but the company is working to establish its products in Europe and Asia. The first hurdle is obtaining regulatory approval for all of the components in its platform for each country it seeks to enter.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   NuVasive sells its products through its own direct sales force and through exclusive distributors and independent sales agents.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   NuVasive's revenues have steadily increased as it has grown through increased product sales, new product additions, and acquisitions, including a 19% jump to $962.1 million in fiscal 2016. That year's growth was driven by increased spinal hardware product sales, which rose 20%, and higher surgical support sales, which rose 14%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has fluctuated in recent years. In 2016, it fell 44% to $37.1 million -- despite the higher revenue -- as operating expenses such as sales and marketing and R&amp;D costs rose.
  </p>

  <p>
   NuVasive's goal is to make its products and services part of the standard procedure for minimally invasive surgery up and down the entire spine. The firm is focused on expanding the reach of its MAS platform through marketing and sales force efforts to increase market penetration. It also conducts research and development efforts to improve existing offerings to make them more adaptable for surgeons and hospitals.
  </p>
  <p>
   R&amp;D efforts create new products as well. As cervical disc replacement technology -- the holy grail for spinal device makers -- is advancing rapidly, NuVasive has several cervical disc replacement devices in late-stage development.

  <p>
   In mid-2016, NuVasive acquired Biotronic NeuroNetwork, which provides intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring services, for $98 million. That deal, which more than doubled NuVasive's neurophysiology footprint, extended the operations of the company's newly established NuVasive Clinical Services division. That unit now provides monitoring services for more than 75,000 cases each year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year, the company acquired Ellipse Technologies, which developed magnetic growing rod implant systems, for $380 million; those products, which eliminate the need for repeat surgeries as pediatric patients grow, are now sold by NuVasive Specialized Orthopedics. In yet another deal, it purchased the LessRay software suite, which enhances image quality while helping health care providers manage radiation exposure.
