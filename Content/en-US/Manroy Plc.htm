   Manroy (formerly Hurlingham) knows sometimes there's a need to be defensive. The company designs and sells machine guns and related products and accessories, including weapon tripods and mounting systems. Manroy's flagship product is the M2 HMG, which it has supplied to the UK's Ministry of Defense for more than 25 years. Its guns can be fitted to armored vehicles, patrol boats, helicopters, and aircraft.  Manroy also does business in other parts of Europe, as well as North America, Asia, and Australia. The company's Manroy Engineering subsidiary, which was founded in the mid-1970s by Madeleine and Roy Swainbank, manufactures its guns. In 2014, Manroy plc was acquired by FN Herstal and delisted.
