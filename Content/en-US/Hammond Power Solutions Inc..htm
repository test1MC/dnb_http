  <p>
   HPS' revenues increased 2% from 2013 to 2014. (Note: growth rates may differ after conversion to the US dollar.) Its net income, however, declined 58% from 2013 to 2014 mainly due to foreign exchange losses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue growth for 2014 was fueled by an uptick in sales from India; an expansion of its North American Electrical Distributor (NAED) footprint; and increases in alternative energy, commercial projects, and capital equipment market segments in Canada. In addition, bookings jumped due to stronger bookings in both the distributor and direct channels in the North American and international markets.

Hammond Power Solutions also looks to sell its custom engineered transformers to both new and existing markets, including the alternative energy, mining equipment, oil and gas, and motor control drives industries.
