   ZiLOG tries to control its own destiny with a portfolio of embedded control chips. The semiconductor company makes a wide variety of integrated circuits, including embedded processors and microcontrollers. These chips are used in consumer electronics, industrial controls, point-of-sale terminals, and security systems, among other products. ZiLOG has also supplied devices to such communications equipment makers as

  <p>
   Founded in 1974 by
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   whiz kids Ralph Ungermann (co-founder of networking product maker Ungermann-Bass, later acquired by
   <company id="10381">
    Compaq
   </company>
   ) and Federico Faggin (co-inventor of the microprocessor), ZiLOG built one of the first mass-produced microprocessors, the Z80. But when
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   chose Intel's 8086 microprocessor over the Z80 for the first PC, ZiLOG became an also-ran.
  </p>
  <p>
   Exxon (now
   <company id="10537">
    Exxon Mobil
   </company>
   ) bought ZiLOG in 1981. Former
   <company id="15718">
    General Instrument
   </company>
   executive Edgar Sack was called in to turn the company around in 1984. He led an MBO five years later. ZiLOG went public in 1991, moving into satellite modems and chasing small custom semiconductor orders.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits dropped for 1997 as the chip industry entered a prolonged slump. Texas Pacific Group (now
   <company id="51545">
    TPG Capital
   </company>
   ) bought ZiLOG the next year. Sack was replaced by former
   <company id="46656">
    Lucent
   </company>
   executive Curt Crawford, who refocused ZiLOG on embedded chips.
  </p>
  <p>
   ZiLOG purchased chip design firm Production Languages in 1999 and took a 20% stake in digital logic chip developer Qualcore in 2000. Also that year TPG filed to return ZiLOG to the stock market once again, though it later withdrew the filing.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Crawford announced he would step down as CEO; he brought back former CFO James Thorburn (from
   <company id="60890">
    ON Semiconductor
   </company>
   ) to succeed him. Later in 2001 the company laid off 10% of its workforce, then carried out a refinancing plan under which ZiLOG's creditors swapped debt for equity stakes in the company while ZiLOG filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company emerged from Chapter 11 in 2002, by which time TPG had shed its majority stake in the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Harking back to its illustrious history of the Z80 microprocessor and the popular Z8 microcontroller, ZiLOG introduced the Z8 Encore! flash microcontrollers in 2002 and the eZ80 Acclaim! flash-based MCUs in 2003. The Z8 Encore! XP MCU was unveiled in 2004. Also that year the company sold its 200mm semiconductor manufacturing equipment to
   <company id="42481">
    STMicroelectronics
   </company>
   for $26 million, completing its transition to becoming a fabless semiconductor company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under James Thorburn as CEO, the company saw a revolving door installed in its executive suite. Thorburn himself left the company in 2006. ZiLOG named former Intel executive Darin Billerbeck as CEO in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to keep its footing, ZiLOG sold its universal remote control technology, intellectual property, and assets in early 2009 to
   <company id="14885">
    Universal Electronics
   </company>
   and
   <company id="14048">
    Maxim Integrated Products
   </company>
   . Maxim also scored the assets of ZiLOG's secure transaction microcontroller business. ZiLOG received about $31 million in cash for the two transactions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 IXYS acquired ZiLOG for about $62 million. IXYS had first expressed interest in acquiring the company in May 2008.
