   Molson Coors Brewing Company (MCBC) drinks with the big boys: the company is one the world's largest beer makers by volume. Operating through its subsidiaries, MCBC produces some 30.2 million hectoliters (800 million US gallons) of beer a year. The beer maker's portfolio of brands, led by Molson Canadian and Coors Light, dominates the Canadian market, accounting for about 40% of the beer sold in that country. In the US, MCBC does business through
   <company id="159739">
    MillerCoors
   </company>
   , a joint venture with
   <company id="54451">
    SABMiller
   </company>
   . MillerCoors, the second-largest US brewer by volume, markets Coors, Coors Light, and Molson brands. In addition to Canada and the US, MCBC operates in the UK, and as Molson Coors International (MCI), in developing markets.

   The MillerCoors joint venture, anticipated to take market share from US beer behemoth
   <company id="10116">
    Anheuser-Busch
   </company>
   , combined both companies' popular brands. The combination of MillerCoors added several new business arrangements, too. The venture brews, packages and ships beer for the
   <company id="41456">
    Pabst Brewing Company
   </company>
   under contract. A deal with
   <company id="55826">
    Miller Brewing Company
   </company>
   (a US subsidiary of SABMiller) enables MCBS to brew, market, and sell Miller brands abroad, as well. The company also has a UK subsidiary,
   <company id="135066">
    Miller Coors Brewing Company (UK) Limited
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Molson Coors International (MCI) sells products in developing markets in Asia, continental Europe (excluding Central Europe, which is part of the Europe segment), Latin America (including South America), the Caribbean (excluding Puerto Rico, which is part of the US segment) and Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its core product portfolio includes the Carling, Coors Light, Molson Canadian, and Staropramen brands.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Denver-based MCBC sells its products worldwide. Canada is the brewer's largest market, accounting for 40% of sales; while the UK represents another 34%. The company has more than a dozen brewery/packaging plants in Europe, six in Canada, and three in Asia.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   MCBC markets products through media advertising (television, radio, print), as well as tactical advertising (signs, banners, point-of-sale materials). The company spent $400 million on advertising in 2015, down from the recent peak of $486.4 million spent in 2014. The company's advertising spending was $458.5 million and $423.5 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the US, the company mostly distributes beer through a three-tier system consisting of manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. MillerCoors products are purchased and distributed to retail accounts through a national network of roughly 450 independent distributors. In Europe, MCBC may distribute through either a two-tier system (manufacturers and retailers) or a three-tier system, similar to the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, MCBC sold about 19% of its Canada segment beer volume on-premise, in bars and restaurants. The other 81% was sold off-premise, through convenience stores, grocery stores, liquor stores, and other retail outlets.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015, MCBC's sales dropped 14% to $3.6 billion from $4.15 billion in 2014. Sales decreased in all the company's markets. The decline was led by a 16% fall in Canada, which felt the loss of the Miller brand agreement, a weak economy, and increased promotions from competitors.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's profit took a 30% tumble in 2015, falling to $359 million from $514 million in 2014. Cash flow also slowed in 2015, dropping to $696 million from $1.27 billion.

  <p>
   MCBC continues to follow a growth strategy that consists of building a stronger brand portfolio, delivering value-added innovation, growing the market share among its core brands, and growing its business in the above premium, craft, and cider markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, is selling its Vancouver brewery in favor of building a more efficient and flexible brewery over the next few years.
  </p>
  <p>
   MCBC in 2015 agreed to buy the 58% of MillerCoors that it didn't own from SABMiller. The purchase was generated by the merger of
   <company id="47435">
    AnheuserBusch InBev
   </company>
   and
   <company id="54451">
    SABMiller
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Moving more into premium products, the company in early 2015 began selling premium import brands owned by
   <company id="41852">
    Heineken
   </company>
   , including the Desperados, Dos Equis, Moretti, Sol, and Tecate brands.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 MCBC agreed to pay (US)$12 billion for SABMiller 58% stake in MillerCoors, the joint venture the company's formed in the US in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2015 MCBC acquired Mount Shivalik Breweries in India. As part of the transaction, it acquired entire brand portfolio, including the leading strong beer brand, Thunderbolt, and assumes direct control over brewing operations in Haryana and Punjab, as well as distribution for Thunderbolt in Bihar. MSBL is a significant player in the strong beer segment in India.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In an effort to boost its top line, MCBC has looked beyond its core markets to growth markets around the world. Its share of the Canadian and UK market has remained increasingly robust, but luring US beer drinkers is challenging. In 2010, the company's MCI division moved deeper into China, through a venture with Si'hai Brewing Company, as well as Spain, with
   <company id="100423">
    Mahou San Miguel
   </company>
   for Carling beer. MCI also launched Coors Light in Vietnam and Russia, and entered Ukraine, Eastern Europe's second-largest beer market, through a joint venture with local brewer Obolon Company.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Adolph Coors landed in Baltimore in 1868, a 21-year-old stowaway fleeing Germany's military draft. He worked his way west to Denver, where he bought a bottling company in 1872 and became partners with Jacob Schueler, a local merchant, in 1873. The partners built a brewery in Golden, Colorado, a small town in the nearby Rocky Mountain foothills. Coors became sole owner of the Adolph Coors Company in 1880.
  </p>
  <p>
   For most of its history, Coors confined its sales to western states. The cost of nationwide distribution was prohibitive because the company used a single brewery, natural brewing methods, and no preservatives; Coors beer was made, transported, and stored under refrigeration, with a shelf life of only one month.
  </p>
  <p>
   The brewer survived Prohibition by making near beer and malted milk and by entering cement and porcelain chemical ware production. The Coors family built a vertically integrated company that did everything from growing brewing ingredients to pumping the oil that powered its breweries. By 1929, when Adolph died, son Adolph Jr. was running the company. After repeal of the 18th Amendment, beer sales grew steadily in the company's 11-state market.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the 1960s Coors beer had achieved cult status. Another result of the company's national reputation was that the Coors family had become notoriously private. In 1960 Adolph III was kidnapped and murdered, sending the clan into an even deeper state of secrecy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adolph Jr. died in 1970; his son Bill was named chairman and started the country's first aluminum-recycling program. Coors beer was the top seller in 10 of its 11 state markets by 1975, when the company went public. However, sales began to decline as
   <company id="55826">
    Miller Brewing
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10116">
    Anheuser-Busch
   </company>
   introduced new light and super-premium beers. Coors responded by introducing its own light and super-premium brands and expanding its market area to 16 states.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the late 1970s and 1980s, the company began rapid expansion while enduring boycotts and strikes due to alleged discriminatory labor practices. The brewer eventually developed progressive employment policies.
  </p>
  <p>
   It spun off its packaging and ceramics firm ACX Technologies in 1992. Also that year it introduced Zima, a clear, malt-based brew. Leo Kiely became the first president of the company's brewing operations from outside the Coors family in 1993. The company also cut its workforce by nearly 700 positions; the severance program cost $70 million and resulted in its first loss in more than 10 years.
  </p>
  <p>
   Specialty Blue Moon products were piloted at its Sandlot microbrewery in 1995. The company formed a partnership with
   <company id="42382">
    Molson Breweries
   </company>
   and
   <company id="42414">
    Foster's
   </company>
   in 1997 to manage the distribution of its brands in Canada. (Foster's later sold its stake to Molson.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Peter Coors (Adolph's great-grandson) was named president and CEO of Adolph Coors Company and chairman of Coors Brewing Company. In 2001 the brewer formed a joint venture with Molson to distribute Molson's beers in the US. In 2002 Belgium's Interbrew (now known as
   <company id="47435">
    Anheuser-Busch InBev
   </company>
   ) sold the Carling division of its Bass Brewers holding to Coors for nearly $1.8 billion. The purchase led to the creation of
   <company id="135066">
    Coors Brewers Limited
   </company>
   , which makes the Carling, Worthington's, and Jaffrey's beer brands, as well as Grolsch (under license).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company announced in 2003 that it would cut the workforce at its Memphis brewery by 20%. In 2004 chairman Peter Coors failed to capture a seat in the US Senate. Following the merger, 11 top executives left the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Molson signed a contract with the
   <company id="40330">
    NFL
   </company>
   in 2005, making its subsidiary
   <company id="135066">
    Coors Brewing Company
   </company>
   the "Official Beer Sponsor" of the league through the 2010 football season.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the 2005 merger of Coors and Molson to form Molson Coors, the company added control of three more well-known brands: Coors Light, Carling, and Molson Canadian. It began selling Coors Fine Light Beer in Russia during 2005, its first foray into that country. However, due to poor sales, it pulled out of the country during 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold a 68% stake in its Brazilian brewing operation to
   <company id="116587">
    FEMSA Cerveza
   </company>
   for $68 million in 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   In  May 2011 vice chairman Andrew Molson succeeded Peter Coors as chairman of the company. Coors became vice chairman. (The company's by-laws provide for the chairman and vice chairman to alternate between the Molson and Coors families every two years.)
