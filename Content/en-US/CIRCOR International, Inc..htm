   After experiencing several straight years of steady growth, CIRCOR saw its revenues decline 2% from $858 million in 2013 to $841 million in 2014. Its profits, however, jumped 7% from $47 million to peak at $50 million during that same time period due to a decrease in impairment charges.
  </p>
  <p>
   Energy segment sales dropped in 2014 due to lower shipment volumes within large international projects. It also experienced declines from its control valves businesses and unfavorable foreign currencies. Aerospace and defense segment revenues decreased due to declines in California business related to its landing gear product line.
