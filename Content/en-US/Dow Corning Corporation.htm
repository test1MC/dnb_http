   Dow Corning knows about cooperation. The company is a joint venture of chemical titan
   <company id="10471">
    Dow
   </company>
   and glass giant
   <company id="10409">
    Corning
   </company>
   . Dow Corning produces more than 7,000 silicone-based products such as adhesives, insulating materials, and lubricants for aerospace, automotive, and electrical uses. Because silicone does not conduct electricity, it is also used in its hard polycrystalline form (silicon) as the material on which semiconductors are built. Its products are also used in the production of photovoltaic cells used to produce solar energy. Through its Xiameter brand and website, Dow Corning sells products online to more than 80 countries. It gets more than half of its annual sales from the US.

   The company wants to further emphasize Xiameter but also to build on its environmental and sustainability offerings. It devotes much of its investment dollars to products relating to the solar energy industry. Key to the solar energy initiative is Dow Corning's ownership in the Hemlock Semiconductor; that company is investing $4.5 billion into solar energy R&amp;D.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company launched a new lighting products, Dow Corning EI-1184 Clear Encapsulant, a highly transparent two-part product designed to protect luminaire components in interior and outdoor applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Dow Corning and JE Berkowitz signed an manufacturing agreement, under which JE Berkowitz will make Dow Corning Architectural Insulation Modules utilizing Dow Corning Vacuum Insulation Panels. These technologies will have a significant impact on improving performance for the curtainwall and window industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Dow Corning opened a healthcare application center at the company's European headquarters. The facility combines the company's extensive expertise in silicone materials with leading-edge application development equipment to support advances in medical, pharmaceutical and healthcare technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   To take advantage of growth opportunities in the Middle East, in 2014 Dow Corning relocated its Middle East representative office to Dubai.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013, to better serve the needs of the pressure sensitive industry in Europe, Dow Corning extended its distribution agreement with
   <company id="161798">
    Univar
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Dow Corning and Tianwei New Energy Holdings Company teamed up to allow Dow Corning's silicone-based, next-generation conductive adhesive Dow Corning PV-5802 is used in Tianwei New Energy's Metal Wrap Through module production line.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an effort to expand opportunities for both organizations to combine their expertise toward the development and broader adoption of 3D integrated circuit (IC) packaging technologies, wherein IC chips are stacked in vertical 3D architectures, in 2013, Dow Corning joined imec, a leading research center for the advancement of nano-electronics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Launching new products, in 2013 Dow Corning introduced new Dow Corning MS-2002 Moldable White Reflector Silicone, which further expanded options for more energy efficient and reliable LED Lighting Designs, and  Syl-Off SL 35 Release Modifier, the next generation of controlled release additive technology for solventless release coatings.

   In late 2013 it acquired
   <company id="52354">
    Mitsubishi Materials
   </company>
   ' stakes in two solar polysilicon manufacturing joint ventures that are part of the Hemlock Semiconductor Group for $240 million. Previously, it owned 63% of Hemlock Semiconductor. The acquisition enabled Dow Corning to generate additional earnings and cash-flow through greater ownership in the companies, which make polysilicon, a key raw material used in the production of semiconductor devices and solar cells.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />

   Equally owned by
   <company id="10471">
    The Dow Chemical Company
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10409">
    Corning, Incorporated
   </company>
   , the joint venture was formed in 1943, and ranks among the longest-lasting partnerships of its kind in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Corning, founded by Amory Houghton in 1875, provided Thomas Edison with glass for the first light bulbs. It developed Pyrex heat-resistant glass in 1915.
  </p>
  <p>
   Corning made its first silicone resin samples in 1938. It teamed with a group of Dow Chemical scientists who were also working on silicone products in 1940. Dow Chemical president Willard Dow and Corning Glass Works president Glen Cole shook hands on the idea of a joint venture in 1942, and 10 months later Dow Corning was formed. Its first product, the engine grease DOW CORNING 4, enabled B-17s to fly at 35,000 feet (a major contribution to the Allied war effort). In 1945 DOW CORNING 35 (an emulsifier used in tire molds) and Pan Glaze (which made baking pans stick-proof and easier to clean) were instant successes on the home front.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dow Corning expanded rapidly in international markets and in 1960 set up Dow Corning International to handle sales and technical service in markets outside North America. By 1969 the company had operations worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dow Corning's first breast implants went on the market in 1964. Over the next three decades, Dow Corning and other silicone makers sold silicone breast implants to more than a million women in the US. In the early 1980s breast-implant recipients began suing Dow Corning and other implant makers, claiming that the silicone gel in the implants leaked and caused health problems. Dow Corning, the leading implant maker, defended the devices as safe. The company stopped making implants in 1992, after the Food and Drug Administration called for a moratorium on silicone-gel implants.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993
   <company id="10188">
    <company id="10188">
     Baxter International
    </company>
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Myers Squibb
   </company>
   , and Dow Corning offered $4.2 billion to settle thousands of claims. The corporation declared bankruptcy in 1995 to buy time for financial reorganization. A federal judge stripped Dow Chemical of its protection from direct liability, and the company was later ordered to pay a Nevada couple $4.1 million in damages (other jurisdictions did not follow suit). Dow Corning sold its Polytrap polymer technology to Advanced Polymer, maker of polymer-based pharmaceutical delivery systems, in 1996. The following year the company sold Bisco Products, its silicone-foam business, to
   <company id="12289">
    Rogers Corporation
   </company>
   for $12 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dow Corning's $3.7 billion bankruptcy reorganization plan, offered in 1997, allowed for $2.4 billion to be set aside to settle most implant lawsuits against the corporation. However, a federal bankruptcy judge found legal flaws in the proposal and refused to allow claimants to vote on it. In 1998 Dow Corning upped the ante to $4.4 billion -- $3 billion to the silicone claimants and the rest to creditors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Both sides later agreed to a $3.2 billion compensation package, and in 1999 the plan received approval from a bankruptcy judge and creditors. However, the settlement stalled when the judge ruled that women who disagreed with the settlement could sue Dow Chemical and Corning (Dow Corning appealed). Despite its court battles, in 2000 the company acquired the 51% of Universal Silicones &amp; Lubricants (high-tech lubricants and silicone sealants) it did not own and renamed the company Dow Corning India.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2004 a bankruptcy court judge ruled that the reapproved settlement go through. The move allowed the money Dow Corning set aside for the settlement to be dispersed to claimants and let the company exit Chapter 11, which finally occurred in the middle of that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Moving outside its traditional position in polymeric silicones, the company acquired the holographic data storage business of Aprilis in 2006. The acquired division, now called DCE Aprilis, operates as a separate Dow Corning subsidiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 Dow Corning bought two chemical-grade silicon manufacturing facilities from
   <company id="159910">
    Globe Specialty Metals
   </company>
   for about $175 million. One of the plants is in Brazil; the other (of which Dow Corning actually bought 49%) is in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a move designed to further secure its supply of raw materials for manufacturing silicon, Dow Corning formed a joint venture in 2010 with
   <company id="117873">
    Timminco Limited
   </company>
   at its production facility in Becanour, Quebec. Dow Corning paid Timminco about $50 million for a 49% share of the facility's annual production of silicon metal. The operation has an estimated capacity of 47,000 million tons per year.
  </p>
  <p>
   To support its solar energy push, Dow Corning has opened solar energy applications centers in the US and Asia (China and Korea). It expanded its Solar Solution Lab in China in 2012 with photovoltaic research and testing capabilities. That year the company added Bardawil Group as distributor of its silicon-based solutions for solar applications in UAE, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.
