  <p>
   In response to poor European demand, the company has updated its chloromethanes operations strategy. In 2016, production will be focused on INOVYN's chloromethanes assets in Tavaux (France) and Rosignano (Italy), which will result in closure of the company's third chloromethanes asset in Runcorn (UK).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company planned major investment in a large scale potassium hydroxide (KOH) production facility at its Antwerp/Lillo site, Belgium, which consists of a 160kT KOH plant using the latest technology and will be on line in 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company divested the chlorine plants and EDC/ VCM plants at Tessenderlo, Belgium (excluding the chlorotoluenes business that will remain with INEOS); the PVC plant at Mazingarbe, France; the PVC plant at Beek, the Netherlands; the PVC and VCM plants at Wilhelmshaven, Germany; and the EDC plants at Runcorn, UK. In addition, the membrane chlorine plant at Runcorn was placed in a 50-50 Joint Venture between INOVYN and International Chemical Investors Group (ICIG), a privately held industrial company.
