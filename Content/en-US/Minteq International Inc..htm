   Enormous steel factories call for monolithic refractories, and Minteq International delivers. A wholly owned subsidiary of
   <company id="12333">
    Minerals Technologies Inc.
   </company>
   , Minteq produces refracting materials for surfaces or applications exposed to extreme high temperatures. The company primarily serves the aluminum, cement, iron, polymer, steel, and other manufacturing industries. Its Pyrogenics Group produces pyrolytic graphite used for thermal management in aerospace, electronics, and glass applications. Subsidiary Ferrotron provides refractories for steel makers, and Minteq's ASMAS unit serves the steel industry in Eastern Europe and Turkey.

   Minteq supplies engineered refractory lining systems, and manufactures monolithic refractories. It makes calcium metal at its Canaan, Connecticut, facility and purchases calcium in international markets; it makes cored wires at its Canaan, and Hengelo (the Netherlands) plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company makes PFERROCA solid-core calcium wire, which is also sold to make batteries and magnets. Its metallurgical wire products and associated wire-injection equipment for use in the production of high-end steel.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its pyrogenics unit is a technological leader in the production of specialized, high-purity carbon products with unique thermal, electrical, physical and chemical properties that have application advantages where extreme temperatures and stress exist. Another division (FERROTRON TECHNOLOGIES GmbH) is a global market leader in laser profile measurement technology used by the refractory and steel industries.

  <p>
   The company's parent reported that its net sales in the Refractories segment grew by 1% in 2013 to $348.4 million. Sales of refractory products and systems to steel and other industrial applications decreased slightly; new business in Europe (primarily from new operations in Bahrain) were offset by lower demand in North America, and lower sales to non-steel applications. Sales of metallurgical products within the Refractories segment increased by 6% as the result of higher volumes in Europe and North America.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2012 Minteq unit ASMAS (in cooperation with United Steel Company B.S.C.) upgraded a greenfield steel mill in the Al-Hidd industrial area in Bahrain, which then began providing refractory materials, service, and equipment for steel-making and molten metal transport vessels at a new steel production facility in Bahrain.
  </p>
  <p>
   By emphasizing research and development and by introducing technologically advanced new products, the company also helps satisfy changing customer requirements, and create market opportunities. Among other things, it has adapted its refractory-based product and application technologies to coal-fired power generation and waste-to-energy incineration processes.
