   In the US,
   <company id="155180">
    Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics
   </company>
   acts as the wholesale distribution partner for the Sysmex coagulation and urinalysis products, while Laboratory Supply Company (LABSCO) serves as the distributor for hematology reagents, controls, and instruments. The company's Sysmex Canada division provides Canadian hematology and coagulation distribution operations.

   While it uses wholesalers to distribute its products (and to promote them in some markets), the company also employs a direct sales force in the US to market its products to customers. In addition to laboratories, hospitals, and other health care clients, the company often services supply contracts with hospital purchasing organizations such as

   and
   <company id="122607">
    Novation

   Sysmex America expands by researching and developing new and improved products, such as enhanced automated blood analyzers and high-volume tube sorters. To further attract and retain clients, it also widens its support service offerings and adds distributors to its already expansive sales network. To meet increasing customer demands, the company added new logistics, processing, and training centers in Lincolnshire and Buffalo Grove, Illinois, during 2012.
