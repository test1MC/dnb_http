   In its business, Shimadzu spends a lot of time on analysis. Shimadzu makes a wide variety of laboratory instruments (gas and liquid chromatographs, mass spectrometers), surface analyzers, testing and inspection instruments, scales, aircraft equipment (flight control and landing gear systems), medical systems (X-ray, ultrasound, fluoroscopy), and industrial manufacturing equipment (deposition systems, LCD injection systems, turbomolecular pumps). Analytical and measuring instruments account for about 60% of sales. Japan is the company's #1 market representing more then 50% of sales. The business dates back to 1875, when founder Genzo Shimadzu Sr. began making instruments for education in chemistry and physics.

   Shimadzu's Analytical and Measuring Instruments segment includes chromatographs and spectrometers, light absorption analysis systems, and compositions and surface analysis systems to support the pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, food and beverage, and environmental areas. Its Medical Systems unit offers digital X-ray, PET and CT scanners, and diagnostic ultrasound equipment. Shimadzu developed the direct conversion flat panel detector, which detects images not previously available. Its Aircraft Equipment business makes products for aircraft safety and passenger comfort, which are used in flight control systems, cockpit displays, and onboard air management systems.
