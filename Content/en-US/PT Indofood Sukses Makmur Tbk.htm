   Presto! A meal in an instant. PT Indofood Sukses Makmur (Indofood) is one of the world's largest makers of instant noodles, also called ramen. The Indonesian company also makes infant cereals, sauces, seasonings, snack foods, cookies and crackers, cooking oils, and margarine for the retail and foodservice sectors. Its Supermi, Sarimi, and Sakura brands of ramen are available in some 150,000 Indonesian retail food outlets. Its Bogasari unit is a major flour miller. It also boasts large oil palm plantation holdings and owns packaging and distribution firms. Although Indofood is publicly traded, it is controlled by executive Anthony Salim's

   . Its instant noodle and seasonings unit is planning to IPO.

   In order to ensure its packaging supply, in 2004 the company announced the purchase of a 60% interest in PT Surya Rengo Containers. Competition and a declining rupiah prompted the company to cut 4% of its workforce and slash 40 dishes from production in 2005. More layoffs were announced at Indofood by the end of 2005. The company said it had dismissed at least 3,500 workers as it struggled to boost its market share for instant noodles.

   However, in 2005 Indofood made it into the
   <em>
    Guinness World Book of World Records
   </em>
   for producing "The Largest Packet of Instant Noodles" -- which weighed in at almost 4.2 tons -- and you thought you ate a lot of ramen during college. In another upbeat 2005 happening, Indofood formed a 50-50 joint venture with

    Nestlé
   </company>
   (PT Nestlé Indofood Citarasa Indonesia) to make and sell Nestlé products throughout the region.
