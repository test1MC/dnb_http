   Aside from its research and development office in Pennsylvania and automotive products group in Michigan, FXI boasts nearly 20 plants in the US in New Mexico, Indiana, North Carolina, California, Pennsylvania, Colorado, New Jersey, Texas, Washington, Nebraska, Oregon, and Mississippi, and outside the states in Mexico.

        <p>
   The company's&#160;transition from public to private ownership has been rocky. Beset by&#160;a downturn in the auto and home&#160;markets and loaded up with debt, FXI and certain of its companies filed for&#160;Chapter 11&#160;bankruptcy&#160;relief in&#160;2009.&#160;The move represented FXI's second time to reorganize its business in&#160;fewer than four years. (The first was in 2005; it emerged in 2007.) The US bankruptcy court approved the sale of most of FXI assets to&#160;the&#160;hedge fund group for $155 million and the assumption of liabilities.

        <p>
   FXI has been known by a few names. In mid-2011 the company changed its name from Foamex Innovations to FXI Holdings. Just a year prior, aiming for a fresh start, the owners&#160;renamed the company to FXI-Foamex Innovations.

        <p>
   FXI has looked to acquisitions and alliances to extend its reach into new, more profitable&#160;directions. Its purchase&#160;of Monzi, a&#160;company that&#160;markets gutter guards,&#160;has&#160;doubled sales of FXI's Rain Filter gutter guards&#160;through partnerships&#160;with

   </company>
   and other major retailers. Other&#160;deals include a direct-mail bedding&#160;effort through home-shopping channel

    QVC
   </company>
   .

        <p>
   FXI's expectations&#160;for global growth&#160;have been frustrating. FXI attempted&#160;a joint venture with Hua Kee Company. The&#160;venture, Foamex Asia, imposed a number of non-compete restrictions that limited FXI's ability to take advantage of&#160;related opportunities. In distress,&#160;FXI sold&#160;its 70% interest&#160;in Foamex Asia (subsequently renamed Foamtec International)&#160;to its partner in 2007.
