   One of the world's oldest and largest semiconductor makers, Texas Instruments (TI) offers more than 100,000 products. Its largest segment is analog semiconductors, which change real-world signals (such as sound and images) into the digital data streams. Analog product are used to manage power in all electronic devices; TI sells these products to customers in the consumer electronics and industrial markets, among others. The company also makes embedded processors, which can process data from analog chips and handle specific tasks in electronic devices. TI's other products include digital light processing (DLP) chips used in high-definition projectors, custom semiconductors, and calculators. It generates most of its sales from the Asia/Pacific region.

  <p>
   The company operates through three segments: analog, embedded processing, and other. The analog business, which accounts for about 64% of sales, includes high-volume analog and logic products, power management semiconductors, and catalog analog products such as amplifiers and data converters. The embedded processing segment, which includes application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), digital signal processors (DSPs) and microcontrollers, generates about 22% of sales. The remaining 14% of sales comes from smaller products lines such as calculators and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).
  </p>
  <p>
   In terms of markets, TI gets about 30% of revenue each from personal electronics and industrial uses. Automotive and communications markets account for about 15% each.
  </p>
  <p>
   TI makes most of its products in facilities in the US, Europe, and Asia.

  <p>
   The Asia-Pacific region (including China) is its leading market, accounting for 61% of revenue. Europe accounts for 17% of revenue, the US generates about 12%, and Japan, 9%.

  <p>
   The company markets its products through a direct sales force, as well as via distributors and third-party sales representatives. Distributors generate about 60% of sales. Apple was the biggest single customer in 2015, making up 11% of revenue.

  <p>
   Sales for 2015 were $13 million, about even in the dollar amount to 2014. While analog and embedded processor sales increased 3% and 2%, respectively, in 2015, sales of ASICs and DLPs fell 15%.
  </p>
  <p>
   TI squeezed out a 6% profit increase to just under $3 billion in 2015 with reductions in research and development and sales and general expenses. Its net profit margin was 23%, the fourth time in 10 years it was over 20%.
  </p>
  <p>
   TI closed 2015 with nearly $4.3 billion in cash flow from operations, compared to about $4 billion in 2014.

  <p>
   TI's strategy is to focus on its analog and embedded processing businesses, which the company expects to account for 90% of revenue in the next few years. It was 86% in 2015 and 83% iin 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a marketing move, the company is positioning its website, TI.com, as a source for buyers of semiconductor products. The company envisions its business customers shifting their buying habits to online sources as consumers have done.

   Clarence "Doc" Karcher and Eugene McDermott founded Geophysical Service, Inc. (GSI) in Newark, New Jersey, in 1930 to develop reflective seismology, a new technology for oil and gas exploration. In 1934 GSI moved to Dallas. The company produced military electronics during WWII, including submarine detectors for the

    US Navy
   </company>
   . GSI changed its name to Texas Instruments (TI) in 1951.
  </p>
  <p>
   TI began making transistors in 1952 after buying a license from Western Electric. The company went public on the
   <company id="41286">
    New York Stock Exchange
   </company>
   in 1953. In 1954 it introduced the Regency Radio, the first pocket-sized transistor radio. (That year TI also produced the first commercial silicon transistor.) Impressed by the radio,

   president Thomas Watson made TI a major supplier to IBM in 1957. That year the company opened a plant in the UK -- its first foreign operation.

   TI engineer Jack Kilby invented the integrated circuit (IC) in 1958. (Working independently,

   co-founder Robert Noyce developed an IC at the same time, while working at

   </company>
   ; the two men are credited as co-inventors. In 2000 Kilby was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work; Noyce could not be awarded the prize, since he had died 10 years earlier.)
  </p>

   Other breakthroughs included terrain-following airborne radar (1958), handheld calculators (1967), and single-chip microcomputers (1971). During the 1970s TI introduced innovative calculators, digital watches, home computers, and educational toys such as the popular Speak &amp; Spell -- the first TI product to use digital signal processors (DSPs), which decades later would become a major driver of TI's growth.
