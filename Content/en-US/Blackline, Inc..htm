   Even the exciting job of accounting has its boring tasks. But BlackLine and its cloud-based accounting software are here to subtract the drudgery. The company's software automates many of the mundane, but essential tasks accountants involved in accounting. It ensures controls are in place and followed, makes sure closings are accurate and complete, reconciles balances from subsystems, and manages data flow between different systems. And the software documents it all. The software integrates with big systems from SAP and similar providers. BlackLine's customers include the

   BlackLine's public stock offering was well received, raising about $146 million in October 2016. The company's plans for the proceeds include paying back debt, research and development, sales and marketing, capital expenditures, and, perhaps, acquisitions. As a private company, BlackLine was backed by the firms

  <p>
   Some 96% of BlackLine's revenue comes from subscriptions and support services with professional services accounting for the rest.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seven cloud-based products comprise BlackLine's accounting platform. The products are Account Reconciliation, Task Management, Journal Entry, Variance Analysis, Consolidation Integrity Manager, and Daily Reconciliation. Customers can buy subscriptions to the program individually or in packages that the company has grouped into Reconciliation Management and Financial Close Management, Intercompany Hub, and Insights.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's software works with general ledger systems, financial systems, in-house systems, and more than 30 enterprise resource planning systems including

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Customers in the US generated about 86% of the California-based company's revenue. The company doesn't break international revenue into specific markets, and it reports that no geographic market outside the US accounts for more than 10% of revenue. It has offices in the US, the UK, Europe, Australia, and Asia.

  <p>
   BlackLine sells through a direct sales organization, which works with technology vendors, professional services firms, and business process outsourcers to reach customers. The company works to sell additional subscriptions once it lands a company as a customer. It counts more than 1,500 customers and more than 147,000 end users of its accounting software.
  </p>
  <p>
   It has customers in healthcare, technology, telecommunications, financial services, consumer-retail, and industrial equipment and services. Among those on its client roster are Costco, Kraft Heinz, Mondelez, Under Armour, Autodesk, DaVita, SunTrust Bank, and Kempinski Hotels.

  <p>
   BlackLine's revenue jumped 61% to $83.6 million in 2015 from $51.7 million in 2014 as it added more customers and end users.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net loss deepened to $24.7 million in 2015, compared to $16.7 million in 2014. In trying to add customers, BlackLine spent more on sales and marketing and research and development in 2015 than 2014.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   BlackLine has several avenues of growth in mind. One is to get its products into companies and then expand the number of users in those companies. Known as 'land-and-expand,' the strategy has paid off for BlackLine with a growing number of end users in corporate clients each year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has targeted international markets for growth. The acquisition of Runbook, based in the Netherlands, brings along customers in Europe as well as Runbook's technology. Runbook's close relationship with SAP plays into BlackLine's strategy of partnering with software providers such as SAP and NetSuite, professional service firms such as Deloitte &amp; Touche, and business process outsourcers such as Cognizant and IBM.
  </p>
  <p>
   BlackLine has invested in R&amp;D and sales and marketing, which, in both, involves hiring more people, to stoke its growth.

  <p>
   In August 2016 BlackLine spent $34 million to buy Runbook Company, a Netherlands-based provider of financial close automation software and integration solutions for SAP customers. The deal adds to Backline's capability to work with SAP's platform and other systems. It also expands BlackLine's footprint in Europe.
