   OpSec Security Group despises phonies and goes to great lengths to protect its customers from them. The anti-counterfeiting firm operates through several product categories: Government Protection, Brand Protection, and Transaction Cards. Government Protection operations provide holographic products for paper currency, and vehicle documentation and tax stamps and excise stamps, among other offerings. Brand Protection provides product authentication technologies, while its ID Solutions business provides advanced security printing for various types of ID cards.

  <p>
   OpeSec primarily serves banks, governments, law enforcement agencies, and consumer goods manufacturers. It sells its products through a network of over 40 agents worldwide to more than 400 companies across industry sectors and 50 governments.

  <p>
   The company operates manufacturing and software development facilities and laboratories in the US, the UK, Germany, Hong Kong, and the Dominican Republic and also has sales operations across the Americas, Europe, and Asia. More than 60% of its revenue comes from its US operations.

  <p>
   OpeSec's revenue increased 7% from 2013 to 2014, primarily due to the full year results of its acquisition of the holographic business of JDSU (acquired in 2013). The company in 2014 also observed a 27% increase from its American operations resulting from a rise in new customers across the Government Protection group and also a strong revenue growth from the Transaction Cardmarket.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net loss, however, increased by 30% from 2013 to 2014, due to a sharp spike in expenses, especially in distribution and selling expenses affiliated with acquisitions and legal and professional fees. (Note: Growth rates and declines may differ after conversion to the US dollar.)

  <p>
   OpSec's strategy is to continue to provide its authentication technologies and services into its core markets, leveraging its technology portfolio, its expertise, and its global distribution network. OpSec intends to invest in people, technology, manufacturing and distribution to continue its growth and broaden its product offerings. It will also continue to make acquisitions that fit its core market strategy or enhance its technology portfolio.
