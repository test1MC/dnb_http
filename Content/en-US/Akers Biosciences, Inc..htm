   When there's no time to send a sample off to the lab, Akers Biosciences (ABI) steps up. The company manufactures a variety of point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests. In addition to tests for such diseases as malaria, it has produced screening tools to detect drug and enzyme levels in blood. ABI has also developed sniffing devices to detect breath alcohol as well as diseases such as lung disease and diabetes through breath analysis. Another product whiffs for biological warfare agents in the air. Its Tri-Cholesterol product is a home-use test kit. ABI customers include health care facilities (hospitals, physicians' offices) as well as the US military and aid organizations. The company went public in early 2014.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 IPO.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ABI raised some $15 million in its January 2014 initial public offering.
  </p>

  <p>
   Product revenues contribute about three-fourths of the company's earnings. These products, both commercial- and pipeline-stage, span such health care areas as cardiology and emergency medicine, metabolism and nutrition, diabetes, and the detection of respiratory and infectious diseases, as well as workplace alcohol safety.
  </p>
  <p>
   Product revenues from related parties account for nearly 20% of earnings, while licensing revenues account for nearly 10%.

  <p>
   ABI's New Jersey headquarters encompasses its R&amp;D, engineering, manufacturing, operations, and support units. The company does most of its business in the US, but also distributes its products in Europe, China, Australia, Singapore, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company primarily sells its products to clinical laboratories, physicians' offices, urgent care clinics, the military and government, and the health and wellness market (nutraceutical firms, fitness centers, weight-loss centers). Its alcohol breathalyzers are sold to industries such as industrial safety, education, and law enforcement.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to direct sales channels, ABI partners with distributors to sell its products. For example,
   <company id="12894">
    Cardinal Health
   </company>
   and Fisher Healthcare account for about 35% and 10% of all sales, respectively.
  </p>

  <p>
   Revenues have been growing for ABI since 2012. In 2014, revenue rose 24% to $4.4 million thanks to rising sales of the PIFA Herapin/PF4 Rapid Assay lines (which more than doubled) and the introduction of the Rapid Enzymatic Assay products to markets in Australia, Singapore, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates. This was partially offset by falling sales of the MPC Products line.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the rising revenue, ABI has reported net losses since its inception. Administrative costs and sales and marketing expenses drove those losses to $3.1 million in fiscal 2014. As of the end of 2014, the company's deficit totaled $84.9 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow also increased that year, rising 42% to $3.9 million on changes in trade receivables and other factors.
  </p>

  <p>
   ABI seeks markets that offer opportunity for growth in developing new products. In terms of distribution, it is seeking further expansion with strong partners. It has recently added the European nations of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and Lichtenstein to its active markets. South America is another target market for the company.
