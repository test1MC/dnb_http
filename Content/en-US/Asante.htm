  <p>
   In 1988 electrical engineers Wilson Wong (former president and CEO) and Jeff Lin (former chairman and CEO) -- immigrants from Taiwan and Hong Kong, respectively -- started Asanté (a toast meaning "to your health" in French) in a Silicon Valley warehouse. Asanté's initial networking products were for
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   Macintoshes, a market largely ignored by an industry focused on connecting
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   compatibles. By 1991 Asanté had become #1 in Macintosh Ethernet adapters. The company introduced adapters for PCs in 1992. In 1993, the year Asanté went public, Lin replaced Wong as CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Increased competition took a bite out of Asanté's market share in 1995, leading to a loss. In response the company streamlined operations and lowered prices. But the losses continued in 1996. Asanté expanded its product line in 1997 when sales of its adapters declined. The continued boom in computer networking returned Asanté's bottom line to the black that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company restructured, cutting positions and moving toward retail and catalog distribution. But lower sales and intense competition caused a loss for fiscal 1998. In the shadow of the poor results, Lin resigned and Wong took over again as CEO. Slim sales and inventory write-offs caused the company to suffer losses again for fiscal 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   Asanté's restructuring efforts began to pay off by 2000, as the company's bottom line edged back into black. In 2001 Asanté introduced its first wireless-ready Internet access router.
  </p>
  <p>
   The assets, liabilities, and operations of Asanté were acquired by TechnoConcepts, a fabless semiconductor company, in 2005. TechnoConcepts then merged Asante with RegalTech, keeping an 85% equity stake in the combined company. Former shareholders of RegalTech kept 15% of the company.
