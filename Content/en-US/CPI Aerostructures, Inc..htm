   To build an aircraft, some assembly is required, and CPI Aerostructures is ready. CPI Aero delivers contract production of structural aircraft subassemblies, chiefly for the US Air Force and other US military customers. Military products include skin panels, flight control surfaces, leading edges, wing tips, engine components, cowl doors, and nacelle and inlet assemblies. The lineup is used on military aircraft, such as the C-5A Galaxy and C-130 Hercules cargo jets, E-3 Sentry AWACs jet, and T-38 Talon jet trainer. As a subcontractor to OEMs, CPI Aero also makes aprons and engine mounts for commercial aircraft, such as business jets. Government prime and subcontracts represent a majority of CPI Aero's sales

  <p>
   CPI Aero reported a 7% decline in revenues in 2013 due to a drop in prime government contracts. It also saw a decline in government subcontracts and commercial contracts.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 net income decreased by 30% due to a decline in revenues and an increase in interest expense as the result of a rise in the average amount of outstanding debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company saw a cash inflow from operating activities of $3.3 million (compared to an outflow in $22.1 million in 2012) due to a decline in cash used in Tax benefit for stock options, a decrease in accounts receivable, higher costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts, and cash provided by a decrease in other assets.
  </p>

  <p>
   CPI Aero's performance has depended on winning government and military work coupled with commercial contracts (although in 2013 the company announced plans to transition away from being a prime government contractor). In 2014 the company received orders totaling $14 million from
   <company id="11093">
    Northrop Grumman
   </company>
   for Outer Wing Panel (OWP) kits. In 2013 it received an extension, through 2015, to its existing General Ordering Agreement with Bell Helicopter.
