   Founded in 1851 as a small grocery store, William Jackson Food Group offers a cornucopia of food choices. Its business lines include its Jackson's Bakery business, which makes sandwich breads, cobs and rolls; Aunt Bessie's, which sells potatoes, puddings, dumplings, stuffing and desserts; MyFresh, which specializes in preparing fresh vegetables and salad; and Abel &amp; Cole, which delivers organic vegetables boxes and other groceries to homes across England. Its Parripak business, rooted in Bedfordshire on 700 acres, supplies onions, potatoes, carrots, ginger, garlic, and exotic vegetables, to foodservice clients, food makers, and caterers. The family-owned company is run by the founder's great grandson.

   Another business under William Jackson includes Lancashire-based Hazeldene Foods, one of the UK's leading suppliers of freshly prepared salads.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Aunt Bessie's brand is known throughout the UK as being provider of quintessentially British food, such as bubble and squeak, dumplings, and parsnips and cauliflower cheese; frozen meals include toad-in-the-hole and minced beef cobbler. As a result, the brand is one of the fastest-growing food brands in the nation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its MyFresh veggie and salad ingredients are sourced from the UK, or through its Spanish business, WJFG Europe, when unavailable locally.

  <p>
   William Jackson has ventured further out into Europe in recent years to keep its food supplies stable. In 2013, it established its Spanish business, WJFG Europe, which maintains relationships with local fresh produce growers in Murcia to supply the stores with fresh produce should UK crop not be available.
