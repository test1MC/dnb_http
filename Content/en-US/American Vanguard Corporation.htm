   American Vanguard Corporation (AMVAC) bugs bugs, roots out roots, weeds out weeds, and helps people take care of their health and personal appearance. The company makes specialty chemicals designed to protect the health of animals, crops, and people. Products made by its AMVAC Chemical subsidiary include pesticides, plant-growth regulators, herbicides, and soil fumigants. Its GemChem subsidiary distributes the company's chemicals nationally to the cosmetic, nutritional, and pharmaceutical industries. AMVAC also has marketing subsidiaries in the UK and Mexico.

        <p>
   The company's SmartBox delivery system allows for controlled and regular dissemination of crop protection products. AMVAC pairs the SmartBox system with its own insecticides as well as with products of

    Bayer CropScience
   </company>
   and
   <company id="113734">
    Syngenta Crop Protection
   </company>
   (through licensing agreements). This allows AMVAC to offer farmers multiple crop protection options, thereby not allowing insects to develop resistance to any one pesticide.

   Tenkoz; Crop Production Services (formerly United Agri Products, Western Farm Services and Crop Production Services); and Winfield accounted for 26%, 18%, and 11%, respectively of AMVAC's revenues in 2011. The US accounted for 79% of 2011 revenues. The largest non-US customer, Mexico, accounted for 5% of total revenues that year.

        <p>
   AMVAC's revenues increased by 34% in 2011 due to a growth in sales of insecticides as a result of sales of granular soil insecticides which were up approximately 125%, driven by a strong performance from primary corn soil insecticides - Aztec, Smartchoice, Counter and Force. This product group also benefitted from the newly acquired Mocap and Nemacur granular insecticides/nematicides which were purchased in December 2010, and net sales of herbicides were up by 5% over prior year, whereas non-crop segment net sales were up by about 24%.
  </p>
        <p>
   Net income increased by 101% in 2011 thanks to higher revenues, offset in part by a 28% increase in operating expenses.

        <p>
   The company has pursued a growth strategy of acquiring established product lines and companies that complement its core businesses. It also develops and commercializes new compounds through licensing arrangements.
  </p>
        <p>
   AMVAC acquired the domestic segment of the cotton defoliant product Tribufos (sold under the trade name Def) and the global insecticide Ethoprophos (marketed as Mocap) from Bayer CropScience in 2010. The international segment was acquired in late 2011. The acquisition of Def complements AMVAC's existing cotton defoliant product Folex, which it has marketed since 2002. Mocap is used globally to eradicate nematode species in a variety of crops.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2010, the company also acquired the Nemacur insecticide from Bayer CropScience, which is used in more than 30 countries to fight above-ground sucking insects.
