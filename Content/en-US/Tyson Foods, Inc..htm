   Tyson is more than simply chicken. One of the largest US chicken producers, Tyson's
   <company id="10761">
    Fresh Meats
   </company>
   division makes it a giant in the beef and pork sectors, as well. The company also offers value-added processed and pre-cooked meats and refrigerated and frozen prepared foods (pizza crust, desserts, snacks). Its chicken operations are vertically integrated -- the company hatches the eggs, supplies contract growers with the chicks and feed, and brings them back for processing when ready. Tyson's brands include Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, Sara Lee, Ball Park, Wright, Aidells, and State Fair. Its customers include retail, wholesale, and food service companies worldwide.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Tyson processes 35 million chickens, 415,000 pigs, and 125,000 head of cattle every week at some 100 chicken, beef, pork, and prepared food production plants worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tyson's wholly-owned subsidiary Cobb-Vantress Inc. is a top poultry breeding stock supplier globally that leverages research and development to breed desirable characteristics into its flocks.
  </p>
  <p>
   While its chicken operations reach from egg to drumstick, Tyson raises no cattle of its own. It buys live cattle on the open market and they're raised under contract at third-party feed lots. The majority of Tyson's swine are bought from producers; however, it does raise some swine and supplies the resultant feeder pigs to independent producers on a contract basis.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its operations, the company boasts four business segments: beef, chicken, prepared foods, and pork. Beef is actually its largest segment, accounting for about 40% of revenue, with chicken bringing in about 30%. The fast-growing prepared foods segment contributed nearly 20% of sales, with pork at more than 10%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company serves customers across the US and in about 115 countries worldwide. Tyson's major export markets include Canada, Central America, China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, the Middle East, South Korea, and Taiwan. Export sales from the US are about $3.5 billion, or some 10% of total revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tyson has some 800 plants, mills, storage centers, and production facilities across the globe (nearly 475 of them chicken breeder houses).

  <p>
   Tyson had reported steady revenue growth since fiscal 2009, but sales fell 11% to $36.9 billion in fiscal 2016. Revenues declined across all four segments, but the largest drop came in the beef segment as a result of lower beef prices. The divestiture of its Mexican and Brazilian chicken operations and one less week in the fiscal year (fiscal 2015 was a 53-week fiscal year) also impacted the company's revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income, however, continued its upward trajectory in fiscal 2016, jumping nearly 45% to a record $1.8 billion as Tyson saved some $5 billion in cost of sales, including about $2.5 billion in lower live cattle costs. Cash flow from operations benefited from the increase in net income, rising 6% to a record $2.7 billion.

  <p>
   Tyson's continuing focus is on what it calls the "hybrid strategy" of offering fresh meats alongside a robust portfolio of branded prepared foods. It has invested heavily in the higher-margin prepared foods category in recent years, most notably with the 2014 acquisition of
   <company id="162837">
    Hillshire Brands
   </company>
   , and plans to make additional acquisitions as opportunities arise.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company realized synergies and profit improvement of $580 million in fiscal 2016 related to the Hillshire Brands integration and anticipates another $675 million in fiscal 2017. It has identified nine brands (the "core nine") it feels will drive growth in the prepared foods segment in the coming years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Tyson sold its Brazil and Mexico poultry operations to
   <company id="157322">
    JBS SA
   </company>
   for $575 million to help pay down debt associated with the Hillshire purchase.

  <p>
   In 2014 Tyson acquired Hillshire Brands in a $8.5 billion deal. The move catapulted Tyson to one of the top spots in the prepared foods segment and added iconic brands such as Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and Sara Lee to its portfolio.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   During the Great Depression, Arkansas poultry farmer John Tyson supported his family by selling vegetables and poultry. In 1935, after developing a method for transporting live poultry (he installed a food-and-water trough and nailed small feed cups on a trailer), he bought 500 chickens in Arkansas and sold them in Chicago.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the next decade Tyson bought, sold, and transported chickens. By 1947, the year he incorporated the company as Tyson Feed &amp; Hatchery, he was raising the chickens himself. He emphasized chicken production, opening his first processing plant in 1958 in Springdale, where he implemented an ice-packing system that allowed the company to send its products greater distances.
  </p>
  <p>
   John's son Don took over as manager in 1960, and in 1963 it went public as Tyson Foods. Tyson Country Fresh Chicken (packaged chicken that would become the company's mainstay) was introduced in 1967.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rapid expansion included a new egg-processing building (1970), a new plant and computerized feed mill (1971), and the acquisitions of Prospect Farms (1969, precooked chicken) and the Ocoma Foods Division (1972, poultry) as well as hog operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Health-conscious consumers increasingly turned from red meats to poultry during the 1980s. Tyson became the industry leader with several key acquisitions of poultry operations, including the Tastybird division of Valmac (1985), Lane Processing (1986), and Heritage Valley (1986). Its 1989 purchase of Holly Farms added beef and pork processing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Don Tyson relinquished the CEO position to Leland Tollett in 1991. The company increased its presence in Mexico the next year through a joint venture with poultry producer, Trasgo. Also in 1992 the firm plunged into seafood with the purchase of Arctic Alaska Fisheries and
   <company id="127950">
    Louis Kemp Seafood
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Tyson bought Culinary Foods (frozen foods) and Trasgo in 1994, and the seafood division of International Multifoods in 1995. High feed costs and an oversupply of chickens brought down company earnings the next year. In 1997 the company pleaded guilty to charges that it illegally gave former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy thousands of dollars' worth of gifts; the settlement included $6 million in fines and fees.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tyson bought embattled Hudson Foods' poultry operations in 1998. The company said it would take a charge that year of $196 million to restructure. It also sold turkey processor
   <company id="113283">
    Willow Brook Foods
   </company>
   (now part of
   <company id="120959">
    Cargill Meat Solutions
   </company>
   ) to Willow Brook management in 1998. That year John H. Tyson, grandson of the founder, was elected chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Tyson sold its seafood business for about $180 million in a two-part transaction to International Home Foods and
   <company id="105938">
    Trident Seafoods
   </company>
   . John Tyson became CEO in 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the winner in a bidding war with
   <company id="14734">
    Smithfield Foods
   </company>
   , in 2001 Tyson agreed to buy IBP, Inc., the #1 beef processor and #2 pork processor in the US, for nearly $3.2 billion. Tyson tried to back away from the table after accounting irregularities were discovered at an IBP subsidiary, but a Delaware judge ordered Tyson to sit down and finish dinner. The deal was made final in September and Tyson changed the beef processor's name to
   <company id="10761">
    IBP Fresh Meats
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2001 Tyson Foods and six managers were indicted for conspiring to smuggle illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central America to work for lower than legal wages in 15 of its US poultry processing plants. Two managers made plea bargains and testified for the government; another manager committed suicide. Tyson and the remaining three managers were acquitted of the conspiracy charges in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   Suffering from mild indigestion after the merger, in 2002 Tyson announced a restructuring to trim some fat from its fresh pork operations, and agreed to sell its Specialty Brands (frozen foods) subsidiary. In early 2003 sold off its frozen appetizer business DFG Foods.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following the discovery of bird flu on a Texas chicken farm in 2004 and the subsequent banning of the importation of US chicken products by other countries, Tyson consolidated and automated its poultry operations, resulting in hundreds of layoffs at the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tyson announced in 2004 it was being formally investigated by the
   <company id="56705">
    SEC
   </company>
   regarding perquisites given to executives, including retired senior chairman Don Tyson, and then-current chairman and CEO John Tyson. By August the SEC recommended civil action against the company for its failure to disclose $1.7 million in corporate perks given to Don Tyson without authorization from Tyson's compensation committee. Although Don Tyson had already reimbursed the company $1.53 million for then-unspecified benefits, the SEC also announced plans to recommend civil action be taken against him. With neither the company nor Tyson admitting any guilt, the case was settled in 2005 with Tyson paying the SEC $700,000 in fines and the company, $1.5 million. Many of the perks were not disclosed because Don Tyson did not fill out SEC-required questionnaires; however, disclosed perks included having the company pay for his housekeeping and lawn maintenance, and routine non-business use of the corporate jet by his family and friends.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company opened its largest case-ready meat plant in Sherman, Texas. However, that January and February it suspended operations at four of its other beef plants and cut back at a fifth due to a shortage of cattle and the loss of beef exports due to the US's 2003 case of BSE (Bovine spongiform encephalopathy or "mad cow" disease).
  </p>
  <p>
   Growing concern over the role of trans-fatty acids (from hydrogenated vegetable oils) in diet and health led Tyson to begin removing them from its processed foods such as breaded chicken nuggets and chicken tenders. The company announced the removal of trans-fats from all its retail poultry and school foodservice products in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   Recognizing the growing market for alternative and renewable fuels and recognizing its unending supply of meat by-products (in this case, such lovelies as fat, tallow, lard, and grease), Tyson decided to get into the alternative fuel market in 2007 with the formation of a 50-50 joint venture with fuel refiner
   <company id="58058">
    Syntroleum
   </company>
   called Dynamic Fuels. The joint venture was set up to explore the possibility of producing synthetic fuel from Tyson's waste products for the diesel-, jet-, and military-fuel markets. In conjunction with this joint venture, Tyson created a new business unit, Tyson Renewable Products.
