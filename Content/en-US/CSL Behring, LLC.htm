Biotherapeutics are also used in critical care settings for surgical and wound healing applications. CSL Behring is a subsidiary of Australia's

  <p>
   CSL Behring provides 93% of parent company CSL Limited's total revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, CSL Behring's revenue grew 10% to $4.9 billion as demand increased across all geographic markets. Immunoglobins accounted for the largest amount of earnings and sales rose 12% that year; albumin rose 16% due to higher demand in China. Specialty product sales also rose, increasing 18% after its prothrombin complex concentrate Kcentra was approved for the US market.

  <p>
   To expand its product line to treat a wider variety of diseases, CSL Behring regularly conducts research and development activities both internally and through partnerships. The process is time-consuming and tedious. In 2015 it was given approval to bring Respreeza (a treatment for Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, or AATD) to market in Europe. In late 2013, CSL Behring gained approval for prothrombin complex concentrate Kcentra in the US.

  <p>
   CSL Behring opened a new manufacturing facility in Australia in 2014. The biotechnology facility was designed to produce novel recombinant therapies for a range of serious and rare diseases.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also working to expand its presence in emerging markets.

  <p>
   CSL Behring takes the second part of its name from Emil von Behring, a German doctor who worked to find treatments for infectious diseases. Formerly known as ZLB Behring, the company was formed in 2004 when parent CSL Limited acquired Aventis Behring and merged it with its ZLB Bioplasma unit.
