   Invacare helps those with disabilities stay on the move. The company is a leading maker of wheelchairs, including manual, powered, custom-made, and the ultra-zippy chairs used by athletes. It also makes other medical equipment including crutches, patient handling equipment, bed systems, respiratory devices, and motorized scooters, as well as home care durables such as bathing equipment, cushions, and slings. It manufactures and sells its products to health care providers, consumers, and medical equipment dealers in North America, Europe, and the Asia/Pacific region. Invacare's high performance chairs have been used by five-time Olympic gold medalist Hannah Cockroft.

  <p>
   Invacare's two largest product categories are the lifestyle segment, which accounts for about 44% of annual revenue, and the mobility and seating category, which makes up over 30% of sales. The respiratory therapy segment contributes around 15% to total revenue, while the continuing care segment accounts for about 8% of revenues.

  <p>
   Invacare's products are sold in around 100 countries around the globe, with its major markets being the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and China. Europe is the company's largest market, at around 47% of sales, followed by the North America segment, which contributes some 41%. The Asia/Pacific region brings in around 4%.

   Invacare employs a direct sales force. It also markets its products through telesales associates, independent medical equipment distributors, and manufacturer representatives. The company's primary customers include home health care providers and long-term care entities; it also serves some retail customers and government agencies.

  <p>
   Invacare is currently in poor financial health. The company has endured several years of falling sales, and in fiscal 2015 sales fell a further 10% to $1.1 billion, with falls witnessed across all segments. Invacare recorded net loss for a second consecutive year in 2015, at negative $107.2 million, a marginally more positive figure than 2014. Cash from operating activities turned negative in fiscal 2015, falling from $8.9 million to a loss of $5.4 million.

  <p>
   Faced with falling sales and net yearly losses, Invacare is refocusing its product portfolio on a smaller number of its best performing product segments. It has been selling off a series of units since 2012. The company anticipates this move will have a negative impact on total sales, but return it to profitability due to higher margins available on its strongest products. Invacare is also expanding the size and know-how of its sales force to better enable sales of clinically complex products. However, in early 2017, it announced plans to lay off some 100 employees in North America. The layoffs, the largest in a recent string of cuts, fell across different departments.

  <p>
   Invacare traces its roots to the Worthington Company, which began making vehicles for the disabled in 1885. Worthington's successor, Invacare, became a subsidiary of medical equipment maker Technicare in 1971.
  </p>
  <p>
   When
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   bought Technicare in 1978, it put Invacare up for sale; a group led by A. Malachi Mixon, then Technicare's VP of marketing, bought the company. Mixon cut unprofitable lines and pushed product innovation. In 1982 Invacare put out the first motorized wheelchair with computer controls. The company went public in 1984 and entered the European market by purchasing a UK firm. Invacare introduced some 50 new products in 1990, and in 1991 began selling directly to consumers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1990s Invacare focused on acquisitions, such as makers of personal care products, beds and patient-room furniture, and bathing equipment and lifts. Profits dipped in 1997 as many of its larger customers reduced orders in response to federally legislated Medicare reimbursement cuts. In 1998 it acquired medical supplies wholesaler Suburban Ostomy Supply; in 1999 it bought medical supplies maker Scandinavian Mobility International.
  </p>
  <p>
   To enhance consumer brand recognition, in 1999 Invacare began a retail merchandising program and brought its acquired products under the Invacare brand name.
  </p>
  <p>
   After integration with Invacare, Suburban Ostomy Supply was renamed Invacare Supply Group in 2000. Invacare bought Carroll Healthcare, a maker of beds and furniture for the long-term care market, in 2003. In 2004 the company acquired Domus, a manufacturer of complementary products such as bath lifts and walking aids. Invacare bought Medical Support Systems Holdings Limited in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   Invacare purchased two Ohio-based companies (Bergmann Management and an un-named equipment rentals business) in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   Invacare had to make some changes to cope with the economic recession during 2009 and 2010, including cutting back on product development activities and reducing its manufacturing costs by streamlining processes and consolidating facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mixon retired as CEO of the company in 2011 (though he remained chairman of the board), handing the reins to president Gerald Blouch.
