   IIMAK is working to expand into adjacent markets with new products and acquisitions. A global leader in the development, manufacture, and distribution of thermal transfer ribbons, IIMAK was purchased by Altus Capital Partners so that it could tap the industry's anticipated global growth in thermal transfer applications.

   In 2013 IIMAK is expanding its business. In November 2013 the firm acquired Industrial de Informática (IDISA) thermal transfer ribbon and imaging supplies business, thereby expanding its presence in Mexico and Central America. (The new company is known as IIMAK IDISA.) Other recent purchases include the inkjet ink business of Graphic Controls, which included all manufacturing assets and processes from Graphic Controls to produce and distribute drop on demand (DOD) large character inks, high resolution inks, waxjet solid inks, and Xaar printheads. Providing IIMAK with a solid growth platform for industrial inkjet inks, IIMAK also purchased Specialty Ink Company. The acquisition included all formulas, brands, processes, and assets used in producing inks, stamp pads, and related items with the exception of Mark II stamp pads.

   IIMAK was formed in 1984 by Robert Anderson and Andre Gigon, who had bought the US rights to
   <company id="106376">

   </company>
   's thermal transfer printing process. During the late 1980s the technology came to dominate the bar-code industry. After four rounds of capitalization by private investors, IIMAK went public in 1993. It used the proceeds to expand its manufacturing facilities.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1995 IIMAK purchased the right to sell thermal transfer ribbons, paper, and transparencies to about 1,500 customers of printer maker QMS and began using the QMS brand name to sell ribbons and other supplies directly to dealers, distributors, and end users. The following year the company built a second manufacturing plant in Amherst, New York.

   Paxar acquired IIMAK in 1997 for about $200 million. The next year COO Richard Marshall was promoted to president. IIMAK formed an alliance with printer maker Datametrics in 1999 to jointly market both companies' products. In March 2000 a group, including company management and buyout firm Centre Partners, bought 92% of IIMAK in a $127.5 million LBO. Expanding its overseas operations, IIMAK added a production facility to its Brazil sales office in May 2000 and a factory in Belgium in 2001. The company, which was providing manufacturing and fulfillment services to Precision Ribbon Technology (thermal transfer ribbons), acquired Precision in 2002.
