   Sage Products has some sage advice (and products) for warding off infection. The company manufactures and distributes a variety of hygiene products for bathing, incontinence, and oral care. It also makes warmers for its cleansing cloths and industrial microwaves. Sage sells its products worldwide to health care providers, consumers, and the military through supply contracts and through its consumer-products website. Many of Sage's products are water-free, including prepackaged bathing cloths and preoperative skin preparation cloths, making them particularly useful for troops in the field.

   While Sage primarily serves home health agencies, hospitals, and long-term acute care facilities (LTAC), the company also sells directly to consumers through its website. Besides its website, the company sells its wares through an internal sales force, supply contracts, and a network of distributors which includes American Medical Depot,

   , and Buffalo Hospital Supply.

   The company seeks to improve patient safety and outcomes by preventing skin breakdown, health care-associated pneumonia, surgical site infections, and other adverse events, by leveraging its reputation for innovation, manufacturing expertise, and a responsive sales and service team.
  </p>
  <p>
   At a time when hospital-acquired infections (HAI) are receiving heightened attention from both the public and from the federal government, Sage is keenly focused on securing hospital contracts. The
   <company id="103380">
    Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services
   </company>
   (CMS) no longer reimburses hospitals for certain HAIs, such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections or for pressure ulcers. To this end, Sage has instituted a Skin Check program designed to guide hospitals through a skin inspection process it says helps reduce the risk of certain HAIs and pressure ulcers. The company also offers a complementary line of products to go with the program, such as its Prevalon pressure relieving heel protector and its Comfort Bath disposable washcloths.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sage grows primarily by adding new products to its portfolio. In 2014 the company introduced clean-up cloths for patients suffering from incontinence. Other recent additions include the Prevalon Turn and Position System, which helps health care workers turn and reposition patients, as well as heel protectors used to minimize pressure and friction on the heels of bedridden patients, and flushing compliance devices. The Traptex device is designed to keep inappropriate objects (such as the company's cleansing cloths) from being flushed down the toilet.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was acquired by medical equipment maker Stryker Corporation in early 2016. As a part of the larger Stryker, which operates in more than 100 countries, Sage is positioned for further growth, especially abroad.
