   Smaller brewers are green with envy. Heineken, one of the world's brewing giants, sells its namesake beer in a signature green bottle in just about every country on the planet. The Dutch brewer operates more around 160 breweries in 70-plus countries. Its other well-known global brands include Amstel, Affligem, Strongbow Ciders, Sol, and Desperados. In addition to its own brands, the company boasts about 250 international, regional, and specialty beers, including Cruzcampo (Spain), Oxota (Russia), and Bitang (Indonesia). Heineken was started in 1864 by the Heineken family.

  <p>
   The world's third largest brewer (by volume) has production and distribution operations in more than 70 countries, giving it broad access to the world's beer drinkers. Heineken reports its operations in four geographic categories: Europe, Americas, Middle East &amp; Eastern Europe, Africa, and the Asia-Pacific region.
  </p>
  <p>
   Heineken uses only water, barley, hops, and yeast to brew its beers. Unlike some brewers, the company doesn't change its signature beer to suit local tastes but instead imports European ingredients to India, Thailand, Brazil, South Africa, or wherever its breweries are located. All the pipes, vessels, and parts for its production facilities are built in Germany or in Pune, India.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Of Heineken's four geographic divisions, Europe brings in the highest percentage of sales, at about 50% in 2014, followed by Americas at around 25%. Africa and the Middle East &amp; Eastern Europe each bring in more than 15%; the remainder comes from the Asia-Pacific region.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's region-specific beers include Goldberg and Turbo King (Africa), Tectate and Dos Equis (Latin America), and Tiger and Bintang (the Asia-Pacific region). In Europe, outside its main Heineken brand, the company owns Birra Moretti and Amstel.

  <p>
   The company sells its products through multiple distribution models including direct sales via own wholesalers or own pubs, as well as through indirect sales via third parties which are country-specific and diverse. Its customers include retailers, bars, restaurants and clubs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company markets through a more-than 23,000-strong sales force, and has built commercial partnerships with popular marques such as the James Bond film series, and sporting events such as the UEFA Champions League and the 2015 Rugby World Cup.

   Revenue grew in 2015 by €1.2 billion to €20.5 billion in total, a continuation of growth in recent years. While a significant part of revenue growth in 2015 was due to positive exchange rate effects, organic revenue also contributed 3.5 points to growth, which comprised volume growth of 2% and a 1.3% increase in revenue by volume.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income increased by 25% in 2015 to €2.1 billion, in line with higher revenue and boosted by the sale of Empaque, a Mexican packaging business that resulted in a post-tax gain of €300 million. The increase was partially offset by a rise in raw materials, consumables and services expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations also grew, with growth of 14% to €3.5 billion down to an increase in revenue, aided by positive exchange rate effects.

   Heineken aims to grow the brand and capitalize on emerging market growth. To those ends, it launched apps and new bottles and cans to grow the brand, and linked 1,000 locations through shared services to create a 26% reduction in costs per invoice in 2015. Appetite for 0% or low alcohol beverages is on the rise, and Heineken is hoping to increase sales in Radler 2.0% and 0.0%, which it now sells in 45 countries across five continents. To capitalize on the rise in craft breweries, Heineken bought a 50% stake in Lagunitas, an American craft beer specialist, which it hopes to export globally.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is aiming for organic and acquisitive growth in emerging markets and, as such, set up a $60 million brewery in Myanmar and a joint venture and brewery in Cote d'Ivoire. It also acquired Red Stripe, a Jamaican brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   The beer market is in a highly acquisitive phase, and in Heineken in September 2014 rejected a takeover bid from the world's second-largest brewer,
   <company id="54451">
    SABMiller
   </company>
   , on the grounds that it wants to remain independent amid widespread consolidation in the beer industry. SABMiller's bid for Heineken was itself an attempt to defend itself from a takeover bid from the world's largest brewer,
   <company id="47435">
    Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to focus on its core operations, the company disposed of its Mexican packaging business Empaque in 2014 for $1.2 billion. The sale generated revenue of $660 million. Empaque remains a key supplier of Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma, a wholly-owned Mexican subsidiary.

  <p>
   In 2015, the company acquired 50% interest in the Lagunitas Brewing Company, a Californian craft brewery, to ride the craft beer wave and expand the brand globally.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the same year, the company acquired a 53% interest in Pivovarna Lasko, the leading Slovenian brewer, for €119.5 million, in order to strengthen its position in the region. The company also acquired Diageo's 57.9% stake in Jamaican-listed Desnoes &amp; Geddes for $780.5 million, taking its shareholding to 73.3%. The acquisition will allow Heineken to increase its beer businesses in Jamaica, Malaysia, Singapore and Ghana.

   The founding Heineken family has controlled the company since 1864. Along with Molson Coors, Heineken is one of the few family-controlled firms left in the beer business.

  <p>
   Every Sunday morning Gerard Heineken's mother was appalled by crowds of drunken Dutchmen who had consumed too much gin the night before. Heineken, who wanted his mother's financial backing, insisted that drunkenness would decrease if people drank beer instead of gin and pointed out that there were no good beers in Holland. His strategy worked. In 1863 Heineken's mother put up the money to buy De Hooiberg (The Haystack), a 271-year-old brewery in Amsterdam.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gerard proved his aptitude for brewing and within 10 years had established a brewery in Rotterdam. He named the business Heineken in 1873 and launched the company's lucrative foreign trade by exporting beer in 1876 to France. (By the 1950s half the beer brewed by the company was for export.) The company perfected a yeast strain (Heineken A-yeast) in 1886 that is still in use today.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1917 Gerard's son Dr. Henri Pierre Heineken inherited the firm and expanded operations to the US. Making a voyage to that country, Henri Pierre met Leo van Munching, a ship's bartender who displayed a remarkable knowledge of beer. Recognizing van Munching's talent, Henri Pierre hired him as Heineken's US importer. Prohibition killed the US operations, although the company entered new markets elsewhere; after repeal, Heineken was the first foreign beer to re-enter the US market.
  </p>
  <p>
   After WWII, Henri Pierre sent his son, Alfred, to learn the business under van Munching, who had created a national distribution system in the US. Alfred succeeded his father in 1953 and stepped down in 1989.
  </p>
  <p>
   Heineken bought the Amstel Brewery in Holland (founded 1870) in 1968. Two years later it became a producer of stout through the acquisition of James J. Murphy in Cork, Ireland. Facing a consolidation of the European market, Heineken launched a campaign in the 1980s to expand its European beer operations, purchasing breweries in France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, and Spain.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991 Heineken bought the van Munching US import business.
