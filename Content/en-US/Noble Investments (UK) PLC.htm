   Nobel Investments operates several businesses. Its Baldwin's unit, established in 1872, focuses on numismatics while the company's Apex Philatelics auctions world stamps. Trading at Nobel Investments is conducted through wholly owned subsidiary A. H. Baldwin &amp; Sons Limited, which runs auctions in London, New York, and Hong Kong.

   Though previously strictly an in-house dealer and appraiser of coins, Noble Investments trades its shiny goods through a retail website to satisfy its some 45,000 collector clients.
