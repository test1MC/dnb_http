It also sells co-products such as wet distillers grain (WDG), a nutritional animal feed. Serving integrated oil companies and gasoline marketers who blend ethanol into gasoline, Pacific Ethanol provides transportation, storage and delivery of ethanol through third-party service providers in the Western US.

   A stronger economy helped boost the company's revenues by 175% in 2011 thanks to an increase in total gallons sold and a growth in average sales price per gallon. The increase in production gallons sold was primarily due to the consolidation of the financial results of three Pacific Ethanol Plants during all of 2011,,whereas the increase in average sales price per gallon was consistent with the average Chicago Board of Trade price per gallon, which also increased 42% that year.

  <p>
   Pacific Ethanol's net loss decreased by 91% in 2011 due higher revenues and the absence of Loss on investment in Front Range and Loss on extinguishments of debt which were present in 2010.

   Since emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2010, the company has worked to pay down debt and increase its interest in the four Pacific Ethanol plants it operates. It is also looking to acquire additional ethanol production. In 2012 the company gained majority control of New PE Holdco, which owns the plants. Pacific Ethanol already held a 34% state and acquired an additional 33% interest, bringing its ownership interest in the plants up to 67%. The acquisition allowed it to regain control of the Pacific Ethanol plants.

  <p>
   In 2010, Pacific Ethanol Holding Company had its reorganization plan confirmed, allowing the company's four production units to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Pacific Ethanol has long-range plans to add more than 420 million gallons of capacity to its operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also intends to expand its business by providing management services to other third party plants. In this regard, in 2011 it entered into a management agreement with ZeaChem Inc. to provide operations, maintenance and accounting services for its 250,000 gallon per year cellulosic integrated biorefinery in Boardman, Oregon.
