   Lubrizol is a smooth operator -- the world's #1 maker of additives for lubricants and fuels. The
   <company id="10206">
    Berkshire Hathaway
   </company>
   -owned manufacturer has three business segments: Additives, Advanced Materials, and Speciality Products. The Lubrizol Additives segment includes engine oil additives that fight sludge buildup, viscosity breakdown, and component wear; fuel additives designed to control deposits and improve combustion; and additives for paints, inks, greases, metalworking, and other markets. Lubrizol Advanced Materials (performance coatings and chemicals) delivers its products to the personal care and rubber and plastics markets. Lubrizol Speciality Products makes oilfield chemicals and drilling fluids.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The additives maker markets nearly 3,000 products in more than 100 countries. Lubrizol operates facilities in 17 countries (including production facilities in 16 and laboratories in 14).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Lubrizol produces and supplies technologies for  transportation, industrial, and consumer markets. Its products are used in a broad range of applications including engine oils, transmission fluids, gear oils, lubricants, metalworking fluids, pharmaceutical products, performance coatings, personal care products, fire sprinkler systems, and porting goods.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates in three segments, which include Lubrizol Additives, Lubrizol Advanced Materials, and Lubrizol Speciality Products (created in 2015 after an acquisition).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Lubrizol markets its products worldwide primarily via a direct sales organization (and sales agents and distributors where necessary). It customers consist of major global and regional oil companies and industrial and consumer products companies in more than 110 countries. Suppliers are also some of its largest customers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Lubrizol's strategy is to optimize its product mix while closely aligning production capacity with product demand, using a combination of internal growth and acquisitions. For example, in late 2014, Lubrizol created a new business segment -- and revenue stream -- through its acquisition of a global oilfield chemicals business and a drilling fluids business from a leading oilfield service company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 The Lubrizol and
   <company id="101812">
    Mitsui Chemicals
   </company>
   signed a deal making Lubrizol the exclusive worldwide seller and marketer of the LUCANT polymer product range to the lubricant industry.  That year Lubrizol also teamed up with Particle Sciences, an integrated provider of drug development services to offer customers a comprehensive range of materials, drug development and commercial manufacturing services.
  </p>
  <p>
   To meet regulatory requirements for improving energy efficiency and cutting emissions, as well as to meet the demands of their customers, Lubrizol also invests heavily in its R&amp;D operations. The company evaluates some 300 new essential chemistries a year. To implement a multi-year phased investment plan to increase global manufacturing capacity, upgrade operations and ensure compliance with health, safety and environmental requirements, in 2013, Lubrizol completed construction of its $310 million additives manufacturing facility and research laboratory in Zhuhai, China. It also invested in an existing lab in India.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 it announced plans to partner with Oxea Chemicals to build a manufacturing plant in Nanjing China. The plant will produce synthetic refrigeration lubricants for use with ozone-friendly and low global warming potential refrigerants in Asia. To secure a customer supply in Asia, Lubrizol is also moving assets into Asia, including shifting some additive components and materials made in Texas to Zhuhai for blending. It is also expanding in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lubrizol also grows market share through new product introductions. In 2013 it launched Glucamate CCO thickener. This newest rheology modifier in the family of methyl glucoside derivatives gives formulators the ability to create a range of high-performing products. It also introduced Sulfochem EX-70DXS surfactant, a 70% active surfactant that is highly flowable and easy to use, allowing for efficient batching of surfactant-containing personal care and home care formulations.

  <p>
   In 2015 the company bought Warwick Chemicals, a leading global developer, producer, and supplier of stain removal technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2014, Lubrizol purchased
   <company id="14286">
    Weatherford International
   </company>
   's global oilfield chemicals business (called Engineered Chemistry) and Weatherford's drilling fluids business (known as Integrity Industries) for $750 million. That year the company also acquired Vesta, a leading contract manufacturer for the global medical device industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013, Lubrizol acquired Illinois-based lubricating grease manufacturer Chemtool to broaden its Lubrizol Additives Custom Solutions unit's product lines.

  <p>
   The company that eventually became Lubrizol was founded in 1928 by the Smith (Kelvin, Kevin, and Vincent) and Nason (Alex and Frank) brothers, along with their friend, Thomas James. Chemistry was in the Smiths' blood; all three had worked at
   <company id="10471">
    Dow Chemical
   </company>
   , a company their chemist father helped start. Known originally as The Graphite Oil Products Company, Lubrizol's first product, Lubri-graph, was a suspended graphite and oil product designed to keep car springs quiet. Following the success of their anti-squeak product, the principals turned their attention to the gunk that built up from the mineral oil used in car engines. Cars of the era overheated often and pistons frequently became stuck from excessive heat or sludge build-up. Graphite Oil chemists discovered that the addition of chlorine to lubricants solved the overheating problem. The new product (and later the company) was named Lubrizol.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alex Nason went to Detroit in 1935 and convinced
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   to add Lubrizol to its list of recommended products. Following that success Lubrizol was used extensively during WWII by the military, which established performance standards. During the war the company stopped producing lubricants and concentrated solely on additives, including rust inhibitors, detergents, and chemicals to slow oil breakdown.
  </p>
  <p>
   After WWII performance standards for cars were set, and Lubrizol cleaned up, having patented many ingredients and processes used to manufacture lubricants. By the 1950s the privately held corporation was the #1 petroleum additive company in the world. It was during this time that the company made its first acquisition, R.O. Hull Company, a rustproofing chemicals manufacturer (it has since been sold). Lubrizol went public in 1960.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company benefited as environmental regulations grew, since unleaded gas and catalytic converters required new additives. Lubrizol also benefited from the oil crisis in the early 1970s because the more fuel-efficient cars that resulted required new transmission fluids, fuel additives, and gear lubricants. Even the recession helped the slippery company, as industrial companies relied more on quality lubricants and additives to protect costly machinery.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lubrizol purchased lithium battery maker Althus Corporation in 1979 and moved into biotechnology soon afterward. In 1985 the firm bought Agrigenetics Corporation and focused its biotechnology efforts on genetically altered plants. Biotechnology seemed to offer vast patent potential, whereas additives had become so effective that growth opportunities there seemed limited in comparison. However, after seven costly years Lubrizol sold a controlling interest in Agrigenetics, which had become the sixth-largest seed company in the US, to
   <company id="14178">
    Mycogen
   </company>
   (acquired by Dow Chemical in 1998).
  </p>
  <p>
   Lubrizol continued divesting noncore interests, and by 1996 it was back to being an additives company. Despite the turmoil in Asia, the company formed two joint ventures in China in 1997. The next year Lubrizol acquired the Adibis unit of BP Chemicals (now called
   <company id="104684">
    BP Petrochemicals
   </company>
   ) and five other companies, adding a few additional percentage points to its share of the additives market. Shrinking profits caused the company to cut production by approximately 20% and its workforce by 11% between 1999 and 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Lubrizol bought
   <company id="14531">
    RPM
   </company>
   's Alox metalworking additive business. The next year it acquired ROSS Chem, a privately held maker of antifoam and defoaming agents used by the coatings, inks, textile, food, and metalworking industries. The company's 2002 acquisitions included Kabo International (defoaming products), Chemron (specialty surfactants), and Lambent Technologies (silicone defoamers).
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the next year and a half, the company continued to buy when the mood struck. Lubrizol bought the additives business of
   <company id="106621">
    Avecia
   </company>
   in 2004. The former Avecia unit makes pigment and color dispersants for inks and coatings under the brand names Solsperse, Solplus, and Solthix. Later that year it bought up the formerly private company
   <company id="104307">
    Noveon
   </company>
   , which had announced its intention to go public. Noveon makes polymers and additives used in food and pharmaceuticals. The total price Lubrizol paid for the company was $1.85 billion. The deal triggered a restructuring that resulted in Lubrizol's two main operating segments: its former activities called Lubricant Additives and Noveon's operations making up the Specialty Chemicals segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the summer of 2005, the company announced its intention to divest noncore operations, which totaled $500 million in annual sales. The first move came later that year with the sale of Lubrizol Performance Systems to the Dutch medical and industrial technology company Delft Instruments. The following year brought the sale of Noveon's consumer specialties line of chemical products to
   <company id="111610">
    Sun Capital Partners
   </company>
   . The unit provided chemicals and performance materials to the food and beverage, personal care, and textiles industries and had annual sales of about $400 million. Sun Capital formed a new company called
   <company id="159562">
    Emerald Performance Materials
   </company>
   to operate the business. Lubrizol then sold the active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediate compounds business of Noveon to German private equity firm Auctus Management. The move was the last in the planned divestiture of its noncore businesses. It then ceased to use the Noveon name for its specialty chemicals business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because of the large costs involved in maintaining its infrastructure (about $180 million a year), Lubrizol seeks to operate efficiently, periodically restructuring its operations, reducing costs, and eliminating products that perform poorly in the marketplace. Investor Warren Buffett's
   <company id="10206">
    Berkshire Hathaway
   </company>
   acquired Lubrizol in 2011 for about $9.7 billion in cash. The acquisition secured deeper financing for Lubrizol's future expansion activities.
