   You won't need to worry about where you can plug in these lights. Carmanah Technologies is a manufacturer of solar-powered lights and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The company designs and distributes LED products used for infrastructure within the traffic, marine, aviation, obstruction, and offshore wind verticals. Its products use energy-efficient light-emitting diodes or LEDs which produce more light and less heat for their size than many other types of illumination. Carmanah functions through three business segments: Signals (50% of net sales), Power (37%), and Illumination (13%).

  <p>
   The company's largest market is North America, which contributed about 70% of revenue in 2015. Other major markets include Europe (21%), Asia Pacific (5%), the Middle East and Africa, (4%), and South America (1%).

  <p>
   Carmanah has three reportable segments: Signals, Power, and Illumination. The Signals (50% of sales) segment includes results from the traffic, marine, aviation, obstruction and offshore wind verticals. The Power segment (37%) includes operations from its on-grid and off-grid verticals, while Illumination (13%) includes the company's outdoor lighting vertical, including its lineup solar powered outdoor lights.

  <p>
   Carmanah has achieved extraordinary growth the last few years, mainly through the help of acquisitions. Revenues surged from $44 million in 2014 to peak at a record-setting $68 million in 2015. Profits also skyrocketed by over 970% to reach $11 million, another company milestone, mainly due to the significant revenue growth coupled with income tax recovery and investment tax credits recognized during 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2015 was also due to higher sales in its airfield ground lighting, aviation obstruction, and traffic verticals, and the expansion of markets through the introduction of new products and expanded distribution efforts. There was also 53% growth in its Power segment due to higher sales in both its off-grid and on-grid verticals.

  <p>
   One of the ways Carmanah has been growing is through the use of acquisitions. In 2015 the company acquired the Sabik Group of Companies (Sabik). The deal included Sabik Oy, based in Finland; Sabik GmbH, based in Germany; Sabik PTE Ltd, based in Singapore; and Sabik Ltd and Sabik Offshore Ltd, both based in the UK, for $19.1 million. Sabik is a manufacturer in the worldwide marine aids-to-navigation market. The acquisition broadened Carmanah's geographic scope into emerging markets and helped it to achieve historic revenue growth in 2015.
