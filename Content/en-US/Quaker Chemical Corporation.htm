  </p>
  <p>

  <p>
   Quaker Chemical's growth strategy is to focus on a limited number of products and to sell to specific markets in order to maintain quality and market leadership. The company seeks growth through a balance of capital spending and strategic acquisitions. Starting in 2000, it has made a careful and calculated expansion into the global market, expanding from its customer base in North America to new opportunities in South America, Europe, and Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also conducting an integrated marketing campaign which encompasses an updated brand identity, logo, and tagline.

   In 2011, Quaker Chemical acquired specialty lubricant-and-grease manufacturer Summit Lubricants for $30 million.

The company expanded further in 2011 by picking up G.W. Smith &amp; Sons, a top US die casting lubricant provider with commercial and manufacturing operations based in Dayton, Ohio. G.W. Smith, which has net sales of about $14 million per year, will operate as a standalone subsidiary.
