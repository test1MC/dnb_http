   Freudenberg (German for joyous mountain) finds happiness on top of a heap of businesses. Freudenberg is a holding company for muliple autonomous businesses, with interests in seals and vibration control components (50% of sales) to filters, non-woven textiles, specialty lubricants, cleaning agents, and mechatronic (mechanically and electronically engineered) products. Freudenberg sells to a diverse mix of global OEMs primarily in the automotive industry, followed by the chemical, construction, energy, engineering, and textile industries. The company is owned by 320 heirs of its founder, Carl Johann Freudenberg, who in 1849 began what was to become one of the largest and oldest family-owned companies in Germany.

  <p>
   Freudenberg's revenues increased 6% from 2013 to 2014 due to a spike in European (excluding Germany) and North American sales. In addition, the company's net income jumped 21% during that same time period.

   Freudenberg is targeting growth sectors, such as mobility (electric and hybrid powertrains) as well as chemical specialties, and the oil and gas industry. To this end, in 2015 one of its affiliates acquired BlueSky Process Solutions Ltd., a Canada-based designer of differentiated seal products, specifically for the upstream oil and gas segment. The acquisition of BlueSky enabled the company to broaden its product range for its oil and gas customers.
