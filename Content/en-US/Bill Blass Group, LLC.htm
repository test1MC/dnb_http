   Bill Blass Group (formerly Bill Blass Holding) has reached ubiquity status as a licensor. The legendary late designer's longtime, namesake company was famous for its tailored men's and women's clothing known to adorn noteworthy clients from Barbara Bush to Barbra Streisand. William Ralph "Bill" Blass who retired in 2000 and died in 2002, sold the firm in 1999 -- the first of several ownership changes for the American sportswear brand. In late 2008 Peacock International Holdings acquired the worldwide rights to the Blass trademark and the Blass licenses already signed for just $10 million. Peacock International Holdings is now known as the Bill Blass Group.

   With a new CEO and creative director to guide it, Bill Blass Group intends to reinvent and relaunch the Bill Blass brand beginning with the debut of selective collections of women's and men's apparel in time for spring 2016. The brand hasn't shown a new collection since the fall of 2012.
