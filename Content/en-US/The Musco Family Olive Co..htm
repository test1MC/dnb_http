   The Musco Family Olive Co. is one of the nation's leading purveyors of canned and brined olives. The company sells its products primarily under its flagship Pearls brand. It also sells olives under the Early California brand, but also offers private-label services. Musco's products, which include black, green, and Mediterranean olives in sliced, chopped, pitted, low-salt, and whole varieties, are sold through retail food outlets, as well as to restaurants and other foodservice providers nationwide. The family-owned and -operated company was founded by Nicolo Musco, who immigrated to the US from Italy in the 1920s to start a food-distribution company.
