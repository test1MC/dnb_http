   The company was awarded $20 million in stimulus funding from NASA to develop a commercial spacecraft for transporting US astronauts to the International Space Station. NASA distributed funds to five companies in total as it prepared to retire the space shuttle to cut space program costs. SNC has named its seven-passenger vehicle the Dream Chaser; it is slated to be operational in 2014. In 2013
