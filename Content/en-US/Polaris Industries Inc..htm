   A bump in the road is big business for Polaris Industries. The company is one of the world's top makers of off-road vehicles, comprising all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and side-by-side recreational and utility RANGER-brand vehicles. It also manufactures snowmobiles, on-road vehicles, such as the Victory and Indian brands motorcycle, and small electric vehicles (SEVs).

Polaris' lineup is sold through dealers and distributors in North America, Western Europe, Australia, and Mexico.

  <p>
   Polaris has achieved extraordinary growth over the last five years. Revenues surged 5% to $4.7 billion in 2015, while profits peaked at $455 million in 2015. Both these totals represented historic milestones for the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2015 was fueled by a 67% surge in Motorcycle sales as consumer retail demand peaked for its Indian and Slingshot motorcycles.

  <p>
   Acquisitions, as well as internal investments and business alliances, are fundamental to Polaris' strategy for building its portfolio and market presence. In 2015 Polaris acquired the electric motorcycle business of

    Brammo
   </company>
   in a deal that allowed it to focus exclusively on the design, development, and integration of electric vehicle powertrains.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2015, the company acquired Timbersled Products, a privately held Sandpoint, Idaho-based company that is an expert in the burgeoning snow bike industry. The transaction enhanced the company's portfolio within the powersports sector.
