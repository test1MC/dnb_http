   Pilgrim's Pride couldn't be blamed if it spread its tail feathers and did a barnyard strut.

The company sells prepared poultry products under the Pilgrim's Pride and EatWellStayHealthy labels to retail food outlets, distributors, and food service operators. It sells fresh, frozen, value-added prepared chicken, and deli products.

The company is majority owned by Brazil's

  <p>
   Net sales for Pilgrim's Pride rose 2% in 2014 versus 2013, to $8.58 billion, while net income jumped 29% to $711 million over the same period. It was the third consecutive year of steeply increasing profits after Pilgrim's posted a loss of nearly $500 million in 2011. Cash flow from operations has soared along with growth in net income.
  </p>
  <p>
   The rise in 2014 revenue was attributed to higher sales in the US and Mexico, Pilgrim's two core markets. Higher poultry prices and continued strong demand for chicken products, in combination with constrained supply, boosted sales by 2% in the US. The cost of sales for US segment decreased because of lower feed costs and a decrease in wages and benefits. In Mexico sales increased by 2.8% due to favorable foreign currency translation and an increase in prices.

  <p>
   In June 2014, Pilgrim's Pride lost a bidding war to acquire
   <company id="162837">
    Hillshire Brands
   </company>
   (the maker of Jimmy Dean Sausages) to meat giant
   <company id="14965">
    Tyson Foods
   </company>
   . Tyson acquired Hillshire for $63 per share, topping Pilgrim's $55 bid. The battle for Hillshire emphasizes how badly large commodity meat companies want to acquire popular, and more profitable brands. As a consolation prize or sorts, Pilgrim's Pride in July agreed to buy Tyson's poultry business in Mexico (Tyson de MÃ©xico) in a deal valued at $400 million. Indeed, the poultry provider is working to expand into additional international markets to reduce its reliance on the US. In Mexico, for instance, it is expanding distribution of dark meat chicken products. It also identifies the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), including Russia, and Asia Pacific as regions with promising growth potential.
  </p>
  <p>
   Additionally, the company's strategy focuses on improving its product mix and reducing selling, general, and administrative expenses through employee layoffs and supply chain and margin improvements. It is also reviewing more drastic options for streamlining operations, including restructuring, selling assets, consolidating operations, and relocating employees.

   In late 2016, Pilgrim's Pride agreed to acquire smaller rival GNP Company from The Maschhoffs LLC in a deal worth $350 million, allowing Pilgrim's Pride to expand its production and customer base.

   JBS acquired its stake after Pilgrim's Pride emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009. Since its initial investment, the beef and pork producer has increased its share in Pilgrim's Pride to about 75%, gained through subsidiary JBS USA's acquisition of nearly 19 million shares from Lonnie "Bo" Pilgrim in 2012. Pilgrim's Pride has used the money from the stock sale to pay off creditors and fund its struggling operations. Taking over Pilgrim's Pride opened the door for JBS into the US poultry market. As part of the acquisition, Pilgrim's Pride was integrated into JBS USA, which itself is controlled by the Batista family (specifically Wesley Batista and his brother Joesley Batista). The chicken processor's longtime headquarters in East Texas and a satellite corporate office in Atlanta were shuttered, and its corporate and administrative functions relocated to JBS's US headquarters in Greeley, Colorado.

  <p>
   Aubrey Pilgrim formed Pilgrim's Pride as Farmer's Feed and Seed Co. in 1946, with $1,000 in cash and a $2,500 note. Aubrey and brother Lonnie "Bo" Pilgrim (who joined the business in 1947) sold their first chicken from a pen behind their farm supply store and began to give away 100 baby chicks with each feed sack purchase. The Pilgrims bought back some of the grown birds to resell at a profit.
  </p>
  <p>
   As demand for chickens grew, Farmer's Feed and Seed took its first steps toward creating a vertically integrated chicken company. It opened its first processing plant in 1957 and entered the distribution business three years later, delivering chicken to restaurants and grocery stores in northeastern Texas. Bo took over the business when Aubrey died of a heart attack in 1966.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was renamed Pilgrim's Industries in 1968 (and Pilgrim's Pride in 1985). Eggs became part of the product mix in 1969. That year Pilgrim's acquired Market Produce Co., a food distributor with facilities in Arlington, Odessa, and El Paso, Texas. By 1979 the company was selling 1 million birds every week.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1970s and 1980s, Pilgrim grew through acquisitions and by using TV advertising to build a national brand. Its first TV commercial, "The President Speaks," was a humorous 1983 spot featuring Bo in a wide-brimmed pilgrim's hat, addressing his TV audience. To offset the wide swings in prices and profits in the highly cyclical commodity chicken industry, Pilgrim moved into prepared foods in 1986, the year it went public. The firm expanded into the Mexican consumer market in 1988 through the purchase of several chicken producers there.
