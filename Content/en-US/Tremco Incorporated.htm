   </company>
   reported that its industrial segment sales (including Tremco) increased by 5% in fiscal 2014 as the result of organic growth and acquisitions, offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and organic decline. Contributing to the year-over-year growth in net sales in the industrial segment was improved performance by most of its European businesses. The industrial segment contributed about 63% of the parent company's total revenues that year.

   Tremco is part of the growing US paint and coatings segment of the building industry that includes some 1,100 companies with combined annual sales of $20 billion. The industry is dominated by a few large companies, but many smaller companies like Tremco are able to carve out a niche, such as roofing materials and sealants, where it can operate.
