  <p>
   UMG operates in an industry that is shrinking as a result of piracy, declining CD sales, and the plethora of online channels that artists can use to distribute and promote their music today. As a result, major record labels -- including French-owned UMG, Japanese-owned Sony Music Entertainment, and US-owned Warner Music Group -- are struggling to remain profitable and don't have nearly the amount of power to dictate what music gets recorded and distributed as they had in the past.
  </p>
  <p>
   UMG relies on its large portfolio of labels and its mix of classic artists and hip young pop acts to keep itself viable in a volatile industry.

  <p>
   Universal Music Group traces its roots to the founding of the Decca Records in 1934. Jack Kapp, an A&amp;R man from the Brunswick label, started the business as the American offshoot of UK-based Decca Records, founded in 1920s by Sir Edward Lewis. Kapp built the label into a powerhouse of popular music, signing legendary artists such as Bing Crosby, Louis Armstrong, the Andrews Sisters, and Billie Holiday.
  </p>
  <p>
   Decca split from its British predecessor in the 1940s and in 1942 released Crosby's "White Christmas," which became one of the top selling songs of all time. Milton Rackmil became president of the company after Kapp's death in 1949 and led Decca to acquire B-movie producer Universal Pictures in 1952. Under Rackmil's guidance, Universal began churning out stronger films, including
   <em>
    Spartacus
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    The Glenn Miller Story
   </em>
   , and
   <em>
    Pillow Talk
   </em>
   . Decca, meanwhile, kept the hits coming during the 1950s with releases from such music legends as Buddy Holly and Bill Haley.
  </p>
  <p>
   MCA, the powerhouse Hollywood talent agency built by mogul Lew Wasserman, acquired Decca in 1962, primarily to get Universal Pictures. Two years later the company entered the music publishing business when it acquired Leeds Music (founded in 1935). Decca, meanwhile, continued to produce music through the rest of the decade, but in 1973 MCA reorganized its music operations under the MCA Records banner.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though it was still one of the world's top recording companies, MCA Records was slow to react to changing tastes in music during the 1970s, and with its roster of aging stars the company became known in the industry as the Musical Cemetery of America. Things turned around, though, with the arrival of Irving Azoff. The former manager of Steely Dan and the Eagles revived the music business with hit releases from new talent such as Bobby Brown, Tom Petty, and Fine Young Cannibals. Also under his leadership, MCA bought venerable blues and early rock 'n roll label Chess Records in 1985.
  </p>
  <p>
   Azoff's tenure was short-lived, however, due to personality clashes with Wasserman and MCA president Sid Sheinberg, and former CBS Records president Al Teller was appointed to helm MCA Records in 1989. Teller kept MCA growing on a steady diet of hit albums from established artists such as Elton John and Petty, as well as a crop of new singers including Mary J. Blige. MCA tapped into the growing alternative music scene when it acquired Geffen Records, home to grunge kings Nirvana, in 1990. MCA's country music operation was also in high gear in the early 1990s, churning out chart toppers from Vince Gill, Wynonna Judd, and George Strait.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991 MCA was acquired by Japanese electronics giant Matsushita (later
   <company id="41873">
    Panasonic
   </company>
   ) for $6.1 billion, but the change in corporate ownership didn't derail the growth of the company's music business. Reorganized under the name MCA Music Entertainment, the division topped $2 billion in sales in 1994.
  </p>
  <p>
   The financial success of MCA lured Canadian distiller
   <company id="41797">
    Seagram
   </company>
   to buy an 80% controlling stake in the company from Matsushita for $5.7 billion in 1995. Later that year Teller abruptly resigned his post as head of MCA Music (citing differences with Seagram executives, including CEO Edgar Bronfman, Jr.) and was replaced by former
   <company id="103153">
    Warner Music
   </company>
   chief Doug Morris. The following year MCA bought 50% of upstart rap label Interscope, founded in 1990 by producer Jimmy Iovine.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seagram landed the biggest deal in music in 1998 when it acquired European entertainment giant
   <company id="91337">
    PolyGram
   </company>
   for $10.2 billion, making its newly formed Universal Music Group the world's largest recording company. The division boasted more than 15 record labels (including A&amp;M, Island, Motown, and Verve) and Universal Concerts, which operated and booked concerts at 20 venues in the US and Canada. Eager to squeeze cost savings out of its combined operations, UMG began cleaning house immediately in 1999, dropping hundreds of artists (others left on their own) and shutting down several under-performing labels or folding them into more successful ones. It also sold Universal Concerts to
   <company id="52254">
    HOB Entertainment
   </company>
   for about $200 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   That same year UMG clued in to the burgeoning online market and formed
   <company id="61154">
    GetMusic
   </company>
   with rival
   <company id="58218">
    BMG Entertainment
   </company>
   . (BMG later sold its 50% stake to UMG in 2001). The company made a further investment in online music in 2000 when it agreed to join with
   <company id="56304">
    Sony Music Entertainment
   </company>
   to develop a subscription-based service called
   <company id="104393">
    pressplay
   </company>
   (originally Duet; launched in 2001). Later that year French telecommunications giant Vivendi bought Seagram for about $34 billion, creating
   <company id="92356">
    Vivendi Universal
   </company>
   . (The conglomerate eventually dropped the "Universal" from its name to become Vivendi.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 UMG acquired another online subscription music service, EMusic.com, and later that year Vivendi Universal formed
   <company id="106353">
    Vivendi Universal Net USA
   </company>
   to operate its new Internet business units. UMG inked a $20 million three-record deal with superstar Mariah Carey in 2002 following her abrupt departure from Virgin Records. Also that year UMG launched a new label, Universal South, dedicated to country music.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the record business riding a prolonged slump, UMG sold its stake in pressplay (along with Sony) to Roxio (now
   <company id="102418">
    Napster
   </company>
   ) in 2003. Vivendi was meanwhile suffering under the crushing weight of losses brought on by the acquisition of Seagram. It sold
   <company id="105967">
    Vivendi UNIVERSAL Entertainment
   </company>
   to
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   (GE) in 2004 to form
   <company id="128633">
    NBCUniversal
   </company>
   (NBCU), but it chose to retain ownership of UMG. (GE later sold 51% of NBCU to cable giant
   <company id="13034">
    Comcast
   </company>
   .)
  </p>
  <p>
   In a move to shed some of its noncore operations, in 2005 the company sold its CD and DVD manufacturing operations to Glenayre Technologies, later renamed
   <company id="14179">
    Entertainment Distribution Company
   </company>
   , which is a primary manufacturer for UMG.
  </p>
  <p>
   UMG became the world's largest music publisher when it acquired
   <company id="104628">
    BMG Music Publishing
   </company>
   for $2.2 billion in 2006. The deal created Universal Music Publishing Group, the world's #1 music publishing company. In order to clear the sale with the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, Universal agreed to sell copyrights to several of its song catalogs, including songs by artists such as the Kaiser Chiefs, Justin Timberlake, and R. Kelly.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 UMG expanded in Europe with the acquisition of British label
   <company id="104396">
    V2 Music Group
   </company>
   (which was founded by
   <company id="41676">
    Virgin Group
   </company>
   head Sir Richard Branson). The company in 2008 became the largest Latin music company in North America after purchasing Univision's music assets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded its reach to a nearly 50% share of the US Latin music market with the 2008 acquisition of
   <company id="51512">
    Univision's
   </company>
   music assets. The purchase of Univision Music Group included the Fonovisa, Disa, and Univision labels, home to artists such as Marco Antonio Solis and Los Tigres del Norte. The deal formed the Universal Music Latin Entertainment division and specifically expanded its holdings in the regional Mexican music genre.
  </p>
  <p>
   Music industry veterans Lucian Grainge and Douglas Morris were appointed co-CEOs of UMG in 2010, before Grainge became sole CEO in early 2011 and Morris left to become CEO of
   <company id="135429">
    Sony Music
