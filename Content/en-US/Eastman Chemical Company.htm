   Eastman Chemical can recall its past through photos -- it was once part of film giant
   <company id="10500">
    Eastman Kodak
   </company>
   . The company is now a major producer of chemicals, fibers, plastics, rubber materials, polymers, and solvents. The chemicals and materials manufacturer is one of the world's largest suppliers of acetate tow for cigarette filters. Eastman's products include such items as food and medical packaging, films, and toothbrushes. In 2015 the US accounted for 45% of company's revenues; Asia Pacific, 24%; Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 25%; and Latin America, 6%.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Eastman has operations in Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Netherlands, the UK, and the US. Eastman has 49 manufacturing sites and equity interests in 4 manufacturing joint ventures in 15 countries that supply chemicals, plastics, and fibers products to customers throughout the world.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Beginning first quarter 2016, the company's products and operations report in four operating segments: Additives and Functional Products (AFP), Advanced Materials (AM), Fibers, and Chemical Intermediates (CI). The new structure supports Eastman Chemical's strategy to become a specialty portfolio business by better aligning similar businesses in a more streamlined structure.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a result of the re-segmentation, the adhesives resins product lines of the Adhesives and Plasticizers (A&amp;P) segment will be part of the AFP segment, the plasticizers product lines of the A&amp;P segment will be part of the CI segment. Further, specialty fluids, animal nutrition, and food ingredients products are moved from the Specialty Fluids and Intermediates (SFI) segment to the AFP segment, and distribution solvents and ethyl acetate products are moved from the AFP segment to the CI segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prior to 2016 the company reported in five segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Additives and Functional Products segment (24% of sales) consists of rubber materials, specialty polymers, and solvents. The Adhesives and Plasticizers segment (13%) contains adhesives, intermediates, and plasticizer product lines. Its Advanced Materials segment (25%) includes specialty plastics, performance films, and advanced interlayers (polyvinyl butyral, or PVB, sheet used in glass manufacturing). The company's Fibers segment (13%) consists of the acetate tow and textile fibers units. Eastman's oxo and acetyl intermediates products and Solutia's specialty fluids products combined to make the Specialty Fluids and Intermediates segment (25%).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company markets and sells products in 135 countries through a global marketing and sales organization which has a presence in the US and 39 other countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eastman's highly skilled and specialized sales force is capable of providing differentiated product solutions in each of the company's targeted markets
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's products are also marketed through indirect channels, which include distributors and contract representatives, primarily outside of the US. Products are shipped to customers directly from Eastman's manufacturing plants and from distribution centers worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some of the markets the company serves are 3D Printing, Adhesives &amp; Sealants, Appliances, Biodiesel &amp; Agriculture, Building &amp; Construction, Cleaners, Coatings, Consumer Durable Goods, Personal Care &amp; Cosmetics, and Electronics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its top 100 customers accounted for 55% of Eastman's 2015 sales revenues.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Eastman has reported an increasing trend in net revenues over the last five years. In 2015 the company's revenues increased by 1% due to a 30% growth in Additives &amp; Functional Products and a 2% growth in Advanced Materials, partially offset by a 16% decline in Fibers, an 11% decline in Adhesives &amp; Plasticizers, and a 4% decline in Specialty Fluids &amp; Intermediates.
  </p>
  <p>
   The growth in growth in Additives &amp; Functional Products was due to higher sales of products of the acquired Taminco specialty amines and crop protection businesses. Advanced Materials sales increased due to higher sales volume and the acquired Commonwealth Laminating &amp; Coating, Inc. (Commonwealth) performance films business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eastman's growth was partially offset by decline in sales volume from other segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, net income increased by 13% due to higher sales, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses which included selling, general, and administrative expenses and asset impairments and restructuring charges.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eastman reported cash flow of $1.6 billion in 2015 compared to $1.4 billion in 2014.
  </p>

  <p>
   Eastman expands via internal growth and mergers. It focuses on building up a diverse array of products in a wide range of geographic markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   To cut costs, in 2015 Eastman decided to close its Workington, UK, acetate tow manufacturing site. As a part of strategy, it is also pursuing strategic options to divest or otherwise monetize its excess ethylene capacity position and certain commodity olefin intermediates product lines, while retaining its cost-advantaged integrated position to propylene which supports specialty derivatives throughout the Company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company began construction of a 40,000 metric ton expansion of the Crystex insoluble sulfur rubber additives manufacturing facility in Kuantan, Malaysia, expected to be operational in 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company completed a 15% capacity expansion of its Eastman 168 non-phthalate plasticizers at its manufacturing facility in Texas City, Texas. The combination of its Kingsport and Texas City manufacturing allowed Eastman to sustain its leadership position to serve both the North American and export markets, with Europe being a particular area of focus.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Eastman teamed up with Helian Polymers, a leader in the masterbatch and biopolymer industry, to introduce a new low-odor, styrene-free 3D printing solution at the 3D Printshow in London. The new offering will provide makers of 3D filaments with a consistent, high-quality product to ensure the efficacy of 3D printers, empowering consumers to create strong, functional 3D products through desktop printing.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In a major move to boost its specialty chemical portfolio, that year Eastman bought
   <company id="162899">
    Taminco
   </company>
   in a $2.8 billion deal. Taminco's former specialty amines and crop protection businesses are managed and reported as part of the Additives &amp; Functional Products segment and its former functional amines business are managed and reported as part of the Specialty Fluids &amp; Intermediates segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company acquired Commonwealth Laminating &amp; Coating for $438 million including the repayment of debt. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the acquired Commonwealth business is managed and reported in the Advanced Materials segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company bought Knowlton Technologies, a leader in the design, accelerated prototyping and manufacture of wet-laid nonwovens in filtration, friction and custom designed composite webs, for $42 million. That year, to gain a growing and profitable specialty chemical business, it also acquired
   <company id="58872">
    BP
   </company>
   's global aviation turbine engine oil business, (which has annual revenues of $100 million), for $283 million.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Eastman Chemical went public in 1994, but the company traces its roots to the 19th century. George Eastman, after developing a method for dry-plate photography, established the Eastman Dry Plate and Film Company in 1884 in Rochester, New York (the name was changed to
   <company id="10500">
    Eastman Kodak
   </company>
   in 1892).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1886 Eastman hired scientist Henry Reichenbach to help create and manufacture new photographic chemicals. As time passed, Reichenbach and the company's other scientists came up with chemicals that were either not directly related to photography or had uses in addition to photography.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eastman bought a wood-distillation plant in Kingsport, Tennessee, in 1920 and formed the Tennessee Eastman Corporation to make methanol and acetone for the manufacture of photographic chemicals. The company, by this time called Kodak, introduced acetate yarn and Tenite, a cellulose ester plastic, in the early 1930s. During WWII the company formed Holston Defense to make explosives for the US armed forces.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kodak began to vertically integrate Tennessee Eastman's operations during the 1950s, acquiring A. M. Tenney Associates, Tennessee Eastman's selling agent for its acetate yarn products, in 1950. It also established Texas Eastman, opening a plant in Longview to produce ethyl alcohol and aldehydes, raw materials used in fiber and film production. At the end of 1952, Kodak created Eastman Chemical Products to sell alcohols, plastics, and fibers made by Tennessee Eastman and Texas Eastman. Also that year Tennessee Eastman developed cellulose acetate filter tow for use in cigarette filters. In the late 1950s the company introduced Kodel polyester fiber.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kodak created Carolina Eastman Company in 1968, opening a plant in Columbia, South Carolina, to produce Kodel and other polyester products. It also created Eastman Chemicals Division to handle its chemical operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the late 1970s Eastman Chemicals Division introduced polyethylene terephthalate (PET) resin used to make containers. It acquired biological and molecular instrumentation manufacturer International Biotechnologies in 1987.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eastman Chemicals Division became Eastman Chemical Company in 1990. In 1993 it exited the polyester fiber business. When Kodak spun off Eastman Chemical in early 1994, the new company was saddled with $1.8 billion in debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eastman's 1996 earnings were reduced when oversupply lowered prices for PET. Eastman opened plants in Argentina, Malaysia, and the Netherlands in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eastman added to its international locations in 1999 by opening a plant in Singapore and an office in Bangkok. It also bought Lawter International (specialty chemicals for ink and coatings) with locations in Belgium, China, and Ireland. In 2000 the company began restructuring into two business segments (chemicals and polymers) and acquired resin and colorant maker McWhorter Technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Eastman acquired most of
   <company id="10721">
    Hercules
   </company>
   ' resins business. In November the company announced that it had postponed plans to split into two companies (one focusing on specialty chemicals and plastics, the other concentrating on polyethylene, plastics, and acetate fibers) until mid-2002 due to the weak economy. In early 2002 the company announced that it had cancelled those plans altogether and would operate the two as separate divisions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year Eastman announced it would split off part of its coatings, adhesives, specialty polymers, and inks (CASPI) segment. The division had been underperforming and had been hit particularly hard by the high costs of raw materials and a general overcapacity in the marketplace. Eastman sold a portion of CASPI to investment firm
   <company id="40036">
    Apollo Management
   </company>
   for $215 million. Businesses included in the sale were composites, inks and graphic arts raw materials, liquid and powder resins, and textile chemicals. (Apollo called the acquired businesses Resolution Specialty Materials, and then joined RSM with
   <company id="106223">
    Resolution Performance Products
   </company>
   and another of its chemical companies,
   <company id="10226">
    Borden Chemical
   </company>
   , to form the new
   <company id="138217">
    Hexion Specialty Chemicals
   </company>
   in 2005.)
  </p>
  <p>
   It restructured its divisional alignment in 2006 in an attempt to group together related product groups and technologies. In the process, Eastman disbanded its former
   <company id="103838">
    Voridian
   </company>
   Division.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the end of 2007, the company decided to divest its PET facilities in the UK and the Netherlands as well as its Dutch PTA plants. Eastman sold the facilities to Indorama for about $330 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chairman and CEO Brian Ferguson retired in 2009 after nearly seven years as CEO. James Rogers, who had been president of the company and head of the chemicals and fibers group, became his successor, and Ferguson became executive chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the company joined with SK Chemicals in a joint venture to construct a cellulose acetate tow facility in Ulsan, South Korea. Eastman owns 80% of the JV and operates the plant. It also bought a facility in China in 2010 in a joint venture with Mazzucchelli 1849 SPA. The previous year, Eastman had expanded an acetate tow facility it owns in the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eastman Chemical acquired Genovique Specialties Corporation, a global provider of benzoate plasticizers, from Arsenal Capital Partners in 2010. Genovique produces benzoic acid, sodium benzoate, and specialty plasticizers with operations in North America, Europe, and Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eastman bought Houston-based  Sterling Chemicals for $100 million in 2011. The company plans to use Sterling's plasticizers manufacturing plant to produce its own line of non-phthalate plasticizers, Eastman 168, for its PCI segment. The non-phthalate plasticizers, used to soften vinyl, are an alternative to phthalates, which have seen restrictions because of safety concerns.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash for core businesses, in 2011 Eastman sold its Texas-based TX Energy unit to Zero Emission Energy Plants. The TX Energy facility will convert petroleum coke, an oil refining waste product, into hydrogen and pipeline-quality carbon dioxide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eastman Chemicals completed its exit of its Performance Polymers segment in 2011 by selling its polyethylene terephthalate (PET) business to DAK Americas, LLC for about $600 million. Eastman Chemicals had been a top producer of PET, a plastic used to make packaging for soft drinks, food, and water.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a major move, in 2012 Eastman acquired US-based chemicals firm
   <company id="54430">
    Solutia
   </company>
   in a $4.7 billion cash-and stock deal. With the addition of Solutia, Eastman became a top-tier specialty chemicals company. Its products include rubber materials, specialty polymers (synthetic plastics), solvents, adhesives, plasticizers (additives to soften plastics such as PVC), and specialty fluids.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Solutia purchase not only broadened Eastman Chemicals' portfolio but also its geographic reach. The addition was a significant step in the company's growth strategy, particularly in the Asia/Pacific region and other emerging markets, and the company expected the transaction to accelerate the expansion of its businesses worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Eastman also bought Dynaloy, a specialty chemical company in Indianapolis. Dynaloy sells cleaning products used in the manufacture of semiconductors, and the acquisition supports Eastman's efforts to expand its CASPI segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Eastman's joint venture with Sinopec Yangzi Petrochemical announced plans to build a major hydrogenated hydrocarbon resin plant in Nanjing, China, capable of producing 50,000 metric tons of Eastman's Adhesives and Plasticizers segment's Regalite hydrocarbon resins.
  </p>
  <p>
   To meet customer growth, in 2013 the company's Fibers segment joint venture with China National Tobacco completed a new 30,000 metric ton acetate tow manufacturing facility in Hefei, China.
