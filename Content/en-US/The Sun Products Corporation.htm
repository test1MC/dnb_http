   Sun Products believes that its own Sunlight is what everyone needs. The firm makes laundry detergents, softeners, and other fabric care products under the Sunlight, all, Cuddlesoft, Snuggle, Surf, and Wisk brands. Sun Products also makes household cleaning products under the Sun label. Additionally, the company provides contract manufacturing services for major retailers. Sun Products was formed when then-owner
   <company id="56734">
    Vestar Capital
   </company>
   merged its Huish Detergents business with
   <company id="41850">
    Unilever
   </company>
   's North American laundry products lineup. The deal made Sun the second-largest producer of fabric care products in North America, behind
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   (P&amp;G). In 2016 Vestar sold Sun Products to

   for $3.6 billion.

   Connecticut-based Sun Products has US offices in Connecticut, Utah, Arkansas, Minnesota, Maryland, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Texas. It also maintains an office in Toronto.

  <p>
   Sun Products works to nip at #1 P&amp;G's heels by catering to the higher end of the laundry market. Specifically for popular (and pricey) high-efficiency washing machines, which reduce water and energy use, Sun Products manufactures concentrated liquid softeners and cleansers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also focuses on making environmentally-friendly laundry products, such as its All Oxi-Active concentrated laundry detergent, All's Free Clear laundry detergent (which does not contain dyes and perfumes), Snuggle Ultra concentrated fabric softener, and Wisk High Efficiency laundry detergents.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sun Products regularly reviews its business to shutter underperforming facilities and streamline its operations. To this end, the company in mid-2014 is shuttering its Baltimore area plant on Holabird Avenue that manufactures laundry and household care products.

  <p>
   The company is one of North America's top providers of laundry detergent, fabric softeners, dish care, and other household products. Sun Products maintains manufacturing centers in Salt Lake City, Houston, Baltimore, and in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and Dyersburg, Tennessee.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its research and development operations in Trumbull, Connecticut, include the company's 46,000-sq.-ft. North American Technology Center. The center complements its existing facilities and boosts its product development capabilities. Sun Products completed construction in 2012 on a 1 million-sq.-ft. distribution center in Bowling Green that combines the operations of nine separate facilities there.

   To give traction to its brands, Sun Products in late 2012 signed an exclusive multiyear partnership with the
   <company id="116009">
    Little League Baseball
   </company>
   and Softball organization. As part of the move, the company's Snuggle and all brands are the official laundry products of the organizations beginning in 2013. It also keeps its manufacturing facilities busy by serving as a manufacturer and marketing partner to many North American mass merchants, warehouse clubs, dollar stores, and drug stores. It offers liquid and powder laundry detergent, liquid fabric softener, dryer sheets, and dish washing products that can be marketed under private labels.
