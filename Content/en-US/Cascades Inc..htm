   Cascading from Cascades' production lines are packaging and tissue products made mainly of recycled fibers. With integrated operations, the company is the largest collector of recycled papers in Canada, from which it converts, manufactures, and markets products through its Packaging and Tissue Paper groups. The Packaging group generates the majority of Cascades' sales, and business is divided fairly evenly among

    boxboard
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="114603">
    containerboard
   </company>
   , and specialty products (including fine papers and food and beverage packaging).
   <company id="115010">
    Cascades Tissue
   </company>
   produces facial and bathroom tissue, as well as paper towels and napkins. The company's primary markets are North America and Europe, where it has more than 100 facilities.

  <p>
   Cascades has operations in the US, Europe, and Canada and more than 100 production units located in North America and Europe. Its tissue operations have 18 manufacturing and conversion plants in Canada and the US. Canada generates 56% of the company's revenue, while the US contributes 21%. Europe and other countries account for the remainder of revenue.

  <p>
   In the folding carton (boxboard) and corrugated box (containerboard) sectors, most of the North American demand comes from industries operating in the packaging of non-durable goods, particularly food and agricultural. Cascades' tissue papers are primarily sold to the North American retail market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cascades also owns about one-third of
   <company id="118534">
    Boralex
   </company>
   , a public Canadian corporation and a major electricity producer whose core business is the development and operation of power stations that generate renewable energy in Canada, the US, and France.

  <p>
   Cascades has seen its balance sheet fluctuate over the years. After experiencing a rise in revenue during 2012, it saw its revenues decrease by 2% to $3.6 billion in 2013. (Note: the company's 2012 annual financials were restated.) The growth for 2013 was driven by increased sales from its boxboard Europe and containerboard operations. Cascades in 2013 was also helped by higher sales within Italy.
  </p>
  <p>
   After experiencing a net loss of $11 million in 2012, Cascades posted $10 million in positive net income during 2013 primarily due to the higher revenue levels. Cascades sustained a steep decline in operating cash flow during 2012, but cash flow increased by $26 million in 2013 due to cash generated from provision for income taxes, share of results of associates, and joint ventures and net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest.

  <p>
   Due to the capital-intensive nature of its paper business, Cascades keeps a tight lid on costs. In 2014 the company reached an agreement with Rolland Enterprises, a subsidiary of
   <company id="120217">
    H.I.G. Capital
   </company>
   , for the sale of its fine papers activities for roughly $40 million.

  <p>
   The history of Cascades begins with the Lemaire brothers. In 1963 Bernard and Laurent Lemaire offered to rent the Kingsey Falls mill, with an option to buy in the future. Kingsey Falls accepted, and in 1967 the two brothers exercised their option to purchase the facility, forming Cascades Paper Inc. Brother Alain joined the team later that year, and to this day the company still operates its main headquarters in Kingsey Falls.
  </p>
  <p>
   The early 1970s saw the founding of Cascades Forma-Pak, a molded pulp plant. Cascades Forma-Pak eventually became Cascades Paper Inc. (Cabano) in 1976 -- initially owned by Cascades Paper (30%), Rexfor (30%), SDI (20%), and the citizens of Cabano, Quebec (20%). This plant would eventually become a part of modern-day Cascade subsidiary
   <company id="114603">
    Norampac
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The official transition from Cascades Paper Inc. to Cascades Inc. took place in 1982, with the first public offering and listing on the Montreal Stock Exchange. Shortly afterwards, Cascades' first US investment occurred with the founding of Cascades Industries in North Carolina, targeting the tissue-paper market. In the late 1980s, the company spread its wings in Europe. The company acquired a French boxboard plant, and
   <company id="92047">
    Cascades S.A.
   </company>
   assumed the mantle as the European holding company for Cascades Inc. From 1987 to 1989, Cascades continued to acquire companies, adding affiliates in France, Belgium, and New York.
  </p>
  <p>
   After years of running Cascades as president, Bernard stepped down in 1992, and brother Laurent succeeded him. That same year saw Cascades acquire Rolland Inc. and Paperboard Industries Corporation (eventually named
   <company id="105604">
    Cascades Boxboard Group
   </company>
   ). Perkins Papers and
   <company id="118534">
    Boralex
   </company>
   were acquired in 1995. During that same year, Cascades was restructured into five specific business segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="51105">
    Domtar
   </company>
   and Cascades combined their efforts in 1997 to form containerboard and corrugated products manufacturer
   <company id="114603">
    Norampac
   </company>
   in a joint venture.
  </p>
  <p>
   The year 2000 was a banner one for Cascades as the company privatized its three public subsidiaries (Paperboard Industries International, Perkins Paper Ltd., and Rolland Inc) and formed the single entity Cascades Inc. Subsequently, Cascades Inc. completed privatization of
   <company id="92047">
    Cascades S.A
   </company>
   . in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the
   <company id="115010">
    Cascades Tissue Group
   </company>
   continued to expand its US list of affiliated companies through acquisitions, Alain Lemaire took over president and CEO duties from his brother Laurent in 2003. Laurent moved to executive vice chairman and brother Bernard remained chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company began an effort to fine-tune its operations. That year it acquired Dover Packaging, Fraser Papers, and restaurant industry packaging products manufacturer
   <company id="58602">
    Dopaco
   </company>
   , and it got rid of its tissue distribution operations and sold the sanitation products distribution and chemical products manufacturing assets of its Wood Wyant subsidiary to Groupe Sani-Marc.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year it closed down its Fjordcell and Scierie Lemay mills and its Montreal box plant within its boxboard division, and sold its fine papers distribution operations. It also bought several paperboard and cardboard mills in the US, paid nearly $500 million to buy out Domtar's 50% stake in their Norampac joint venture, and acquired the boxboard operations of Rittman and de-inked pulp provider Newstech.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although Cascades realized a modest rise in cumulative 2008 sales over 2007, net income plunged to a C$54 million ($52.8 million) loss.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the boxboard business, which buckled under a C$75 million ($73.4 million) loss in 2008, Cascades combined its North American operations. The move integrated four mills and 12 converting plants with the operations of Norampac (containerboard). In addition a
   <company id="58602">
    Dopaco
   </company>
   converting plant was shuttered and work transferred to a sister plant, as well as an Ontario recycled boxboard mill closed indefinitely, its Scierie Lemay sawmill sold to
   <company id="110788">
    Arbec Forest Products
   </company>
   , and a paper machine in France was permanently unplugged.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cascades' containerboard business also received a difficult makeover. In 2008 and 2009 approximately 600 employees were laid off at the company's US and Canadian converting facilities. In the meantime, a Québec City corrugated plant closed. European operations were impacted, as well. In 2008 the company combined its Cascades S.A. recycled cartonboard business with Italian firm
   <company id="99591">
    Reno de Medici
   </company>
   (RDM). The deal gave Cascades a 36% stake in RDM (the second largest producer of coated recycled boxboard in Europe), for which Cascades contributed its recycled boxboard manufacturing assets in France, Germany, and the UK. Early in 2008, Cascades sold its French pulp mill, Greenfield S.A.S., to
   <company id="93484">
    ArjoWiggins
   </company>
   for $41 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2009 Cascades purchased the tissue operations of Ontario-based Atlantic Packaging Products. The deal increases the tissue group's annual capacity of recycled tissue by 55,000 short tons, and its converting capacity by almost 70,000 short tons. In addition, it moves the Cascades' recycled brand closer to customers west of Québec.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through its Metro Waste Recovery subsidiary, the company expanded its portfolio of on-site collection services of recyclable materials. The subsidiary acquired three companies in 2009: the Canadian assets of
   <company id="14746">
    Sonoco
   </company>
   Recycling, the assets of US-based Yorkshire Paper, and the uncoated partition board manufacturing business of Les Emballages GAB Ltée in Québec. The recovered materials will be utilized by Cascades' mills, enabling it to offer a comprehensive portfolio of converted and printed paper options, as well as an on-site recycled material collection.
  </p>
  <p>
   After a year punctuated by financial difficulties and weakness in the production of non-durable goods, Cascades made a number of cost-cutting moves to drive leaner operations. In 2011 it sold off two US-based boxboard subsidiaries to private equity firm OpenGate Capital. It also sold Dopaco, its converting business for the quick-service restaurant industry, to Reynolds for about $400 million. Prior to that, it divested its only European containerboard mill in France when it sold Norampac Avot-Vallée for $15 million again to OpenGate Capital. Cascades intends to use the proceeds to improve operations at other boxboard facilities and to pay down debt.
