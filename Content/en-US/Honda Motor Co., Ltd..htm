   . Honda Motor is Japan's #2 automaker (after
   <company id="41889">
    Toyota
   </company>
   ) and the world's largest motorcycle producer. The company's car models include the Accord, CR-V, Civic, Element, and Fit; gasoline-electric hybrid versions of the Civic and Accord; and seven models of the luxury Acura line. Honda's line of motorcycles includes everything from scooters to superbikes. The company also makes a line of ATVs and personal watercraft. Honda's power products division makes commercial and residential machinery (lawn mowers, snow blowers, and tillers); portable generators; and outboard motors. Almost 75% of Honda Motor sales come from outside Japan.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's major geographic areas are concentrated in North America (the US, Canada, and Mexico); Europe (the UK, Germany, France, Belgium, and Russia); and Asia (Thailand, Indonesia, China, India and Vietnam). It also has a major presence in Brazil and Australia. Japan accounts for 24% of net sales, while North America generates 45%. Asia brings in 21%, and Europe, 4%.

  <p>
   Honda's operations are divided across the segments of automobile (73% of net sales), motorcycle (14%), financial services (12%), and power product and other (2%).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Honda's revenue increased 7% from 2014 to 2015 due to increased sales across all its segments. Its net income, however, decreased 16% in 2015 due to additional selling, general and administrative expenses resulting from increased product warranty expenses related to airbag inflators. (Note: growth rates may differ after conversion to the US dollar.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Motorcycle segment sales grew 9% in 2015 largely due to a spike in sales in India and Vietnam. Financial services revenue grew 17%, as a result of a rise in operating lease revenues and the positive effects of foreign currency translations. Automobile sales surged by 5%, primarily due to the launch of new automobile models in Indonesia and India. In addition, power product and other segment sales increased by 3% in 2015, resulting from positive foreign currency translation effects.

  <p>
   Honda is enjoying brisk motorcycle sales, particularly in Asia where motorcycles are a popular mode of transportation. Motorcycle sales account for almost 15% of revenues. The company is beefing up production capacity in India to keep up with demand. Indonesia is the world's third-largest market for motorcycles (after China and India). To meet demand, in 2014 Honda opened a second factory in Indonesia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout 2015, the company expanded its sales of the HondaJet for the first time to South America. With the expansion into Brazil, the HondaJet dealer network spans three continents and includes 11 territories spanning North America, Europe, and South America.

  <p>
   Soichiro Honda spent six years as an apprentice at Tokyo service station Art Shokai before opening his own branch of the repair shop in Hamamatsu in 1928. He also raced cars and in 1931 received a patent for metal spokes that replaced wood in wheels.
  </p>
  <p>
   Honda started a piston ring company in 1937. During WWII the company produced metal propellers for Japanese bombers. When bombs and an earthquake destroyed most of his factory, Honda sold it to

    Toyota
   </company>
   in 1945.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1946 Honda began motorizing bicycles with war-surplus engines. When this proved popular, Honda began making engines. The company was renamed Honda Motor Co. in 1948 and began producing motorcycles. Soichiro Honda hired Takeo Fujisawa in 1949 to manage the company so Honda could focus on engineering. Honda's innovative overhead valve design made its early 1950s Dream model a runaway success. In 1952 the smaller Cub, sold through bicycle dealers, accounted for 70% of Japan's motorcycle production.

   Funded by a 1954 public offering and Mitsubishi Bank, Honda expanded capacity and began exporting.

   was formed in Los Angeles in 1959, accompanied by the slogan "You meet the nicest people on a Honda" in a campaign crafted to counter the stereotypical biker image. Honda added overseas factories in the 1960s and began producing lightweight trucks, sports cars, and minicars.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company began selling its tiny 600 model in the US in 1970, but it was the Civic, introduced in 1973, that first scored with the US car market. Three years later Honda introduced the Accord, which featured an innovative frame adaptable for many models. In 1982 Accord production started at the company's Ohio plant.
