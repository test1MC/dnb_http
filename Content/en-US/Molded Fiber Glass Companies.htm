   Molded Fiber Glass Companies (MFG) has shaped its own destiny as a niche manufacturer of fiber glass reinforced plastic products for a variety of applications and industries. The company has about fifteen facilities throughout the US, including plants that specialize in water treatment products, construction products, composite systems, and wind energy systems. The enterprise also has manufacturing operations in Mexico. The manufacturing company's network of 12 operating companies is supported by integrated management, finance, marketing, research, and design resources.

        <p>
   MFG grows by organizing its various units around one of two business models: a) as dedicated manufacturing partners of industrial makers of specific products, such as heavy trucks, automobiles, safety helmets, residential bathroom stalls, mass transit bus and train components, and wind turbine blades, or b) as proprietary product businesses that produce and sell finished products directly to the open market. Products include material handling trays, water and wastewater treatment equipment, reflectors for defense, and beams for building construction.

        <p>
   In 2013 the company renamed composite repair and maintenance services (for wind farm products) unit Wind Energy Services as MFG Energy Services. The change helps MFG define the mobile, on-site nature of its service offering and reflects its plans for expansion into new service areas.
  </p>
        <p>
   To enhance its output in 2011 Wind Energy Services formed a partnership with three MFG turbine component manufacturing facilities (California, South Dakota, and Texas).
