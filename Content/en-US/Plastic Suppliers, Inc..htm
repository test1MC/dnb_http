   Plastic Suppliers is in the film industry, but you probably won't find a wanna-be Cecil B. DeMille or Robert Rodriguez there. The company manufactures and distributes plastic (polystyrene, biopolymer, and other poly substrate-based) films, for such applications as flexible packaging, floral sleeves, labels, lamination, shrink films, and tamper evident seals. Plastic Suppliers capabilities include standard master rolls, as well as custom-width roll manufacture, and slitting and sheeting. The company has its manufacturing operations in Ohio; it also owns regional distribution facilities throughout the US, and in Europe. Its specialty films subsidiary, Sidaplax, is established in Belgium.
