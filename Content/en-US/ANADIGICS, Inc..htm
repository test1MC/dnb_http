   ANADIGICS makes chips that cook with GaAs. The company makes gallium arsenide (GaAs) radio-frequency integrated circuits for cellular wireless, WiFi, and infrastructure applications. GaAs ICs may be costlier than silicon, but their physical properties allow the compound materials to be used for chips that are smaller and faster or more energy-efficient than silicon chips. ANADIGICS' power amplifiers, switches, and other chips can be found in the cable modems, set-top boxes, wireless devices, and other gear of companies including

    Samsung

   ,
   <company id="185340">
    Huawei
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="140691">
    ZTE
   </company>
   . The majority of customers come from Asia. In late 2015, ANADIGICS agreed to be acquired by GaAs Labs, a venture capital firm.

   The $32 million acquisition of ANADIGICS by GaAs Labs will take ANADIGICS private and end its 30 years as an independent company. The deal is expected to close in early 2016. GaAs Labs owns Macom and
   <company id="105309">

   , firms that develops and make communications semiconductors. Nitronex makes gallium nitride chips.

  <p>
   ANADIGICS manufactures its chips at its own plant in New Jersey, and it contracts with WIN Semiconductors in Taiwan for any additional manufacturing needs. The chips are then sent to other contractors in Asia for testing and packaging. The company's chips for communications accounted for 55% of revenue with infrastructure chips bringing in the rest.

  <p>
   The company's US manufacturing plant is located in New Jersey. It also has offices in California, Georgia, and Massachusetts. International customers are served from sales offices in China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. About 90% of ANADIGICS sales are to customers in Asia.

   ANADIGICS uses a direct sales force as well as distributors such as Hong Kong Techtronics and US-based

   The company's revenue plummeted in 2014, falling to $86 million from $134 million in 2013. The bottom fell out of demand for its chips for mobile Wi-Fi applications. Reducing operating costs helped ANADICS improve its net loss from some $54 million in 2013 to $38.9 million in 2014. Negative cash flow was $12.5 million in 2014 compared to a negative $42 million in 2013.,

  <p>
   In a restructuring in 2014, ANADIGICS shifted to markets served by its infrastructure products and away from high-volume, low-margin applications in the cellular market. It released several products for CATV, wireless and Wi-Fi infrastructure uses in 2015. However, as revenue kept falling through 2015, ANADIGICS sought a buyer. It found one in GaAs Labs.

  <p>
   Former RCA engineers Ronald Rosenzweig and George Gilbert started microwave silicon specialist Microwave Semiconductor, which they sold to
   <company id="41843">
    Siemens
   </company>
   in 1983. They founded ANADIGICS the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company initially made its chips in low volumes for radar and other military and aerospace applications. When defense industry spending dried up in the late 1980s, CEO Rosenzweig asked employees to take a 10% pay cut; he refocused the company on mass-market integrated circuits (ICs) for the telecommunications market. In 1989 ANADIGICS won a contract from British Satellite Broadcasting (now
   <company id="42747">
    Sky plc
   </company>
   ) to make a satellite dish system chip. The company introduced ICs for cable television in 1991 and moved into the wireless communications market in 1993. ANADIGICS went public in 1995.
