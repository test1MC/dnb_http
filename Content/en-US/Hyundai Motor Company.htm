   Hyundai vehicles run the gamut from budget cars to luxury sedans to commercial trucks. South Korea's leading carmaker, Hyundai Motor produces compact and luxury cars, SUVs, minivans, trucks, buses, and other commercial vehicles. Its cars are sold in 180 countries through some 6,000 dealerships. Hyundai generates about half of its sales in South Korea, but its vehicles are also popular in emerging markets such as China and India. The company operates a dozen manufacturing plants in China, the Czech Republic, India, Russia, South Korea, Turkey and the

   Hyundai Motor Company was established in 1967, and it initially began manufacturing cars and light trucks through a technology collaboration with
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   's UK operations. By the early 1970s Hyundai was ready to build cars under its own nameplate. The company debuted the subcompact Hyundai Pony in 1974 at Italy's annual Turin Motor Show.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Pony was an instant domestic success and soon propelled Hyundai to the top spot among South Korea's carmakers. During the mid-1970s the company began exporting the Pony to El Salvador and Guatemala.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the 1980s Hyundai was ready to shift into high gear and begin high-volume production in anticipation of penetrating more overseas markets. The company began exporting to Canada in 1983.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hyundai introduced the Hyundai Excel in 1985. That year the company established its US subsidiary,
   <company id="43617">
    Hyundai Motor America
   </company>
   . By 1986 Hyundai was exporting Excels for sale in the US. Sales of the Excel soared the next year, so Hyundai decided to build a factory in Bromont, Quebec.
  </p>
  <p>
   But by the time the factory was finished in 1989, consumers were tiring of the aging compact car and the quality problems that came with it. Hyundai closed the plant after just four years of operation.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company introduced its first sports car, the Scoupe, in 1990. The following year it developed the first Hyundai-designed engine, called the Alpha. Two years later the carmaker unveiled its second-generation proprietary engine, the Beta.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1998 Hyundai was beginning to feel the pinch of the Asian economic crisis as domestic demand dropped drastically. However, the decrease in Korean demand was largely offset by exports. That year Hyundai took a controlling stake in Korean competitor

   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In hopes of increasing its share of the Asian automotive market,
   <company id="58357">
    Daimler AG
   </company>
   took a 10% stake in Hyundai in 2000 (sold 2004). The deal included the establishment of a joint venture to manufacture commercial vehicles, as well as an agreement among Hyundai, Daimler, and
   <company id="52288">
    Mitsubishi Motors
   </company>
   to develop small cars for the global market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Hyundai decreased its stake in Kia Motors to about 46%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year Daimler announced it would exercise its option to take a 50% stake in Hyundai's heavy truck business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Hyundai CEO Kim Dong-Jin was indicted in South Korea on charges that he violated campaign finance laws and engaged in managerial negligence. The charges stemmed from a general crackdown on campaign finance violations, during which more than a dozen members of South Korea's parliament were either indicted or detained. Later in 2004 Kim was convicted of the charges against him and sentenced to a suspended two-year prison term.
  </p>
  <p>
   To increase its presence in the US, Hyundai completed construction of a new manufacturing plant,
   <company id="139970">
    Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama
   </company>
   , in 2005. The plant's annual production was about 300,000 cars.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Hyundai's legal woes persisted when two executives were arrested as part of a Korean bribery investigation. The pair were accused of creating a slush fund that was allegedly used to fund a lobbyist who sought favors for Hyundai from the South Korean government. Officials were also investigating whether the slush fund was created at the behest of Hyundai chairman Chung Mong-Koo.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chung then was indicted and arrested on charges that he embezzled Hyundai company cash to finance bribes for Korean government officials in exchange for corporate favors. After two months of incarceration, Chung was released from jail on $1 million bail.
  </p>
  <p>
   He was convicted early in 2007. Under Korean law, Chung faced a potential life sentence, but received only a three-year prison term as the judge in the case said Chung contributed hugely to the development of the Korean economy. During his trial Chung admitted some wrongdoing when he said "I admit to my guilt, to some extent." However, Chung appealed the conviction. Three other Hyundai officials were also convicted, but they received suspended sentences. Chung's son, Kia Motors boss Chung Eui-Sun, also was under investigation, but prosecutors did not indict him.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2007 Chung's three-year prison sentence was suspended by an appeals court, with a three-judge panel citing his importance to Korea's economy. The appellate judges, however, required the Hyundai executive to maintain a clean record for five years to avoid prison and to fulfill a promise he made to donate $1.1 billion of his personal assets to society.
