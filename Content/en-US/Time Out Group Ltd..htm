   Time Out has been focusing its efforts on digital publishing as of late. In 2012 its
   <em>
    Time Out New York
   </em>
   launched a new e-commerce website, and iPad and iPhone apps. The website allows users to purchase tickets to shows and to book tables at restaurants, while the mobile apps provide information and recommendations about arts and entertainment to users on the go. The apps feature personalization technology that Time Out gained through its 2011 acquisition of LikeCube.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company plans to grow its portfolio of traditional print magazines as well.

   In 2014 the company acquired crowd-sourced event guide Hugecity. The acquisition expanded Time Out's digital offering to a much wider global audience.
