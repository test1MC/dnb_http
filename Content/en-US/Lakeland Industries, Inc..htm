   The wrong clothing can be hazardous to your health -- not based on style, but by

    OSHA
   </company>
   and
   <company id="130205">

   standards. Lakeland makes protective clothing for on-the-job hazards. It uses
   <company id="10487">
    DuPont
   </company>
   specialty fabrics, such as Kevlar, TyChem, and Tyvek, as well as its own fabrics, to make industrial disposable garments, toxic-waste cleanup suits, fire- and heat-resistant apparel (including Fyrepel gear for firefighters), industrial work gloves, high-visibility garments, and industrial/medical garments. Lakeland manufactures its products in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and the US. Customers -- nearly 65% are outside of the US -- include high tech electronics manufacturers, construction companies, hospitals, and laboratories.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Lakeland sells its products to more than 40 countries, primarily in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Europe, and Southeast Asia. The US accounts for roughly 35% of total sales; China, 30%.

   The company also supplies federal, state, and local government agencies such as the

   , the
   <company id="131218">
    Department of Homeland Security
   </company>
   , and the
   <company id="104757">
    Centers for Disease Control
   </company>
   . All total, Lakeland distributes to a network of more than 1,200 North American safety and mill supply distributors and end users, as well as to international clients. It has also developed a number of patented production machinery and fabrics, including Micromax, ChemMax, Despro, and Thermbar.

        <p>
   The company's business is fueled by crises. Its products are useful in situations involving fire and chemical/biological threats, such as the anthrax scare, SARs epidemic, ricin letters, and Avian flu -- all of which have occurred in the last decade. Many Asian and South American countries have since adopted legislation akin to the US Occupational Safety and Health Act, in order to be a part of the
   <company id="100143">
    World Trade Organization
   </company>
   . To meet the stricter WTO standards, these countries need to use appropriate gear, causing orders for protective clothing and equipment to increase.

   Lakeland products are sold by an in-house customer service group, regional sales managers, and independent sales representatives selling to a network of over 1,200 North American safety and mill supply distributors.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company spent $263 million on advertising in 2013 and $310 million in 2012. The
   <company id="131218">
    Department for Homeland Security
   </company>
   is one of its biggest clients.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Lakeland's balance sheet is heading in the wrong direction; it has suffered revenue declines and net losses over the last two years. Revenues fell 2% from $96.3 million in 2012 to $95.1 million in 2013 as it posted a net loss of $26 million for 2013.
  </p>
        <p>
   The decrease was driven by a 19% drop in US disposables sales resulting from the loss of its Tyvek license from DuPont. This offset international gains in Brazil, Chile, and Argentina. China sales also jumped 26% from 2012 to 2013.
  </p>
        <p>
   Its net loss for 2013 increased primarily due to an arbitration settlement and goodwill impairment charge from its operations in Brazil.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   To be closer to customers and to take advantage of the lower production and workforce costs, the company has moved some of its manufacturing to international facilities in Brazil, China, India, and Mexico. It is also sourcing more raw materials from China than from the US or Europe. In 2011 it opened new sales offices in India, Kazakhstan, and Russia.
  </p>
        <p>
   Lakeland has altered its product mix in an attempt to combat competition. Domestic sales of Tyvek, once a major staple in the company's line of products, have fallen off in recent years. Increased sales in the company's line of Hi-Visibility products have partially offset the decline in Tyvek's sales.
  </p>
        <p>
   Lakeland's expansion strategy takes advantage of smaller companies that are experiencing their own crises -- economically. The protective gear industry is fragmented and made up of many smaller companies, unlike mega-competitors
   <company id="10856">
    Kimberly Clark
   </company>
   and DuPont, which, along with Lakeland, have jumped at the chance to pick up smaller companies that have hit on hard times. Lakeland has made acquisitions to build on its product portfolio, increase its ability to cross-sell, and give it a geographic foothold in emerging markets.
