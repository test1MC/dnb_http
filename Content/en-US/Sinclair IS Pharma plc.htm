   Specialty pharmaceutical company Sinclair IS Pharma can help those with itchy skin, bleeding gums, and other ailments. Its portfolio of dermatology products cover three primary areas -- aesthetic, wound care, and skin care. Sinclair IS Pharma develops, acquires, and markets dermatology, wound care, oncology support, and critical care products, including top sellers Atopiclair (eczema), Kelo-cote (scarring), Sculptra (deep tissue regeneration), Bio-Taches (pigmentation disorders), and Flammazine (burns and wounds). Pipeline products include Aloclair and Atlean. The company has a growing sales presence in Europe and works with marketing partners worldwide.

  <p>
   Sinclair IS Pharma has its corporate headquarters in London and its operating headquarters in Paris. The company operates across North America and Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia/Pacific region.
  </p>
  <p>
   European operations account for more than half of revenue -- France alone accounts for some 20% -- while international business accounts for about 40%.

  <p>
   The company sells its products to hospitals, plastic surgeons, dermatologists, and pharmacists. It has its own sales forces in the top five European markets and works with marketing partners elsewhere.

  <p>
   In 2014, revenue increased 15% to £63 million, largely due to strong sales of Sculptra and the acquisitions of new brands Ellansé AQTIS and Silhouette. With the higher revenue, Sinclair reduced its net loss by 69% to £5 million. A decline in administrative expenses also contributed to the improved bottom line.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the company reported a £7 million cash outflow in 2014 (versus an inflow in 2013) on higher interest payments and other payables.

  <p>
   Sinclair IS Pharma is increasingly focused on facial rejuvenation through collagen stimulation products, which show promise in the company's key markets. The firm is also pushing heavily for international growth by establishing long-term sales, marketing, and distribution partnerships. Other initiatives include expanding its product lines and introducing existing products into new markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2015, the company agreed to sell certain dermatology products (including nearly 30 products under the Kelo-Cote, Kelo-stretch, Flammacerium, Aloclair, and Atopiclair brands) to Alliance Pharma for some £127.5 million. Other divestitures, which help the firm to more keenly focus its portfolio, have included Effederm, Xclair, Salinum, and SST.

  <p>
   The company often adds to its product portfolio through acquisitions. In 2014 it purchased Obvieline SAS, which owns the worldwide rights for hyaluronic acid-based dermal filler line Perfectha. It also bought AQTIS Medical, which owns the global rights to collagen stimulating filler line Ellansé. Other deals that year included the purchase of a controlling stake in Silhouette Life (which owns the rights to collagen stimulating cones Silhouette Life and Silhouette Soft) and the acquisition of dermal filler Atlean.
