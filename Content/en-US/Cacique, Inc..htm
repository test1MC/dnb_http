   If you thought the Spanish word for cheese was "queso," you haven't heard of Cacique. The company is one of the largest Hispanic-style dairy product manufacturers in the US. Cacique primarily makes and sells Mexican-style specialty cheeses and creams. Along with such traditional cheeses as queso fresco, manchego, and oaxaca, Cacique produces Mexican-style sausages (beef and pork chorizos, longanizas, and bolitas), the traditional Hispanic rice-based drink called horchata, and Yonique brand banana- and yogurt-based beverages. Its products are sold at food retailers such as

    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   , and

   nationwide. Founded in 1973 by the de Cardenas family, Cacique is still owned and operated by family.

   The company is the largest fresh cheese maker in America and boasts the best-selling chorizos in its market. The company's name -- Cacique -- in Latin America signifies the chief of a tribe, or the ultimate authority.

   While selling cheese is a bread-and-butter business for Cacique, the company has expanded its products portfolio in recent years to diversify. Chasing after the popular yogurt niche of the dairy market and the probiotics craze that supports digestive health, Cacique makes and sells the drinkable Yonique-brand yogurt. The beverage is a low-fat yogurt that comes in several flavors, including mango, strawberry, guava, strawberry banana, and pina colada.
