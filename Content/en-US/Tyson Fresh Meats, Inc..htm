   No matter how you slice it, steak is the main attraction at Tyson Fresh Meats. A processor of beef and pork, Tyson slaughters and sells fresh beef and pork and case-ready ground beef and pork products. Its offerings are sold under brand names, including Chairman's Reserve Beef and Supreme Tender Pork, to mostly US food retailers, food service operators, and meat processors. Tyson does not raise cattle, but has buyers who purchase livestock on the open market. It has swine buyers, as well; however, it does raise some pigs. Non-edible animal remains are processed and sold to manufacturers of animal feed, leather, and pharmaceuticals. Tyson Fresh Meats is a subsidiary of chicken and meat producer

   South Dakota-based Tyson Fresh Meats' operations consist of 17 production sites located in North America. More than half of the production facilities are used in processing cattle, with remaining sites used to process hogs.

   Tyson Fresh Meats (TFM) delivers more than five billion pounds of boxed beef and three billion pounds of pork products to retail and food service customers annually. Beef accounts for nearly three quarters of TFM's $19.8 billion in annual sales, with pork representing the rest.

   Tyson Fresh Meats rang up $19.8 billion in sales in fiscal 2013 (ended September), more than half of parent company Tyson Foods' $34.4 billion in total sales. Tyson Foods has posted four consecutive years of growing sales. Revenue from beef increased 5%, while pork sales declined 2%, versus the prior year. Less volatile cattle markets, strong export sales, and higher prices bolstered beef revenue.

  <p>
   Tyson Fresh Meats' strategy for gaining the top shelf for its products focuses on differentiating itself from major competitors, such as JBS Swift (part of
   <company id="161329">
    JBS USA
   </company>
   ) and
   <company id="14734">
    Smithfield
   </company>
   , as it gooses demand from markets for value-add, higher profit products. To that end, Tyson Fresh Meats promotes a branded program that moves beyond selling beef and pork "in a box" to building consumer loyalty to the Tyson label. In addition to raising brand awareness and trust in its product safety and quality, the company competes on price, as well as breadth and availability of offerings, and customer service.

  <p>
   A. D. Anderson and Currier Holman's experiences in the meatpacking business convinced them that the industry needed modernization. In 1960 they formed Iowa Beef Packers (IBP) and, with their first plant in Denison, Iowa, broke with tradition. To cut costs and save time, the company built facilities in rural areas where cattle were raised and workers were less likely to unionize. Carefully monitored demand and more efficient slaughtering kept inventory from building up.
  </p>
  <p>
   Iowa Beef Packers' highly automated plants were manned by local, unskilled workers with few benefits. Employees organized and in 1965 walked out over the right to strike. Two years later union relations were spoiled further when Iowa Beef Packers began cutting meat into smaller portions, thus reducing supermarkets' need for butchers. "Boxed beef," as it is called, soon became the standard among meat companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1969, when Iowa Beef Packers had eight plants, workers in Nebraska struck over pay. When three Iowa plants shut down, the company sued the United Food and Commercial Workers for sabotage and other interference. Vandalism, shootings, and bombings (one at a VP's home) ensued over several months in a struggle, sparked in part by demands for a raise of 20 cents an hour. Iowa Beef Packers eventually won $2.6 million in damages. In 1970 it changed its name to Iowa Beef Processors.
  </p>
  <p>
   As Iowa Beef Processors expanded, it ran into more trouble. In the 1970s it was investigated for anticompetitive practices, but the inquiry eventually was dropped. During the 1980s Iowa Beef Processors was fined $2.6 million and penalized by
   <company id="150307">
    OSHA
   </company>
   for not reporting workers' hand injuries caused by meat-cutting techniques.
  </p>
  <p>
   Armand Hammer's
   <company id="11110">
    Occidental Petroleum
   </company>
   bought Iowa Beef Processors in 1981. The following year it changed its name to IBP and entered the pork business. In 1987, 49% of IBP was sold to the public. Hammer died in 1990, and the meat business was spun off to shareholders the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding at home and abroad, in 1997 IBP opened a pork processing plant in China and acquired Foodbrands America, Bruss Company, and Hudson Foods' hamburger plant. An
   <i>
    E. coli
   </i>
   scare in 1998 forced IBP to recall 140 tons of ground beef.
  </p>
  <p>
   IBP beefed up its menu of value-added meat products during 1999 when it bought Russer Foods, H&amp;M Food Systems and the assets of Thorn Apple Valley. In 2000 the company paid $550 million for Houston-based Corporate Brand Foods America (processed meats).
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2000, to ward off shareholder and rival
   <company id="14734">
    Smithfield Foods
   </company>
   (then with 6.6% of shares), senior management,
   <company id="10124">
    Archer Daniels Midland
   </company>
   , and other investors proposed an LBO of the company. Smithfield made a counteroffer, which was followed by two other offers ($2.8 billion, then $2.9 billion) from Tyson Foods. As 2001 began, IBP's board declared Tyson the winner with its third offer of close to $3.2 billion. The deal was delayed, however, when the
   <company id="56705">
    SEC
   </company>
   began questioning some of IBP's accounting practices. Although IBP restated its earnings, Tyson attempted to rescind its offer to buy IBP when the investigation revealed other problems within one of IBP's appetizer units (which accounts for less than 1% of sales). IBP sued, demanding Tyson honor its agreement; a judge sided with IBP and the acquisition was completed in September 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the acquisition, Tyson reshaped IBP to only include fresh meats; its processed and frozen foods operations were moved to other units. Initially the group was called IBP Fresh Meats, but in 2003 it was renamed Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc.
  </p>
  <p>
   When a single case of BSE (mad cow disease) was discovered in the US in 2003, Tyson Fresh Meats scaled back some of its production in response to import bans. While US consumers didn't react sharply to the discovery, the company did have to take a $16 million charge in 2004 for losses to its import business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company announced a consolidation of its beef plants in the northwestern US. It closed a plant in Idaho and scaled back operations at a plant in Washington, resulting in nearly 800 lost jobs.
