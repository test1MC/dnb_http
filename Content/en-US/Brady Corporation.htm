   Brady operates in two segments: Identification Solutions (IDS; 70% of sales) and Workplace Safety (WS; 30%). The IDS segment includes high-performance and innovative identification and healthcare products that are manufactured internally under the Brady brand, and are primarily sold through distribution to a broad range of MRO and OEM customers and through other channels, including direct sales, catalog marketing, and the Internet.

  <p>
   Brady operates in 90 locations in nearly 30 countries and has 40 manufacturing or distribution facilities globally. The US accounted for almost 55% of its revenue in 2016.

  <p>
   Brady serves an array of niche markets, where it applies its entire package of expertise in manufacturing, infrastructure, distribution, and sales resources. In addition, the company selects faster growing markets for its ID products, such as laboratory identification, aerospace, defense, and mass transit.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sells its products through distribution to a broad range of maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO), and original equipment manufacturing (OEM) customers, and through other channels, including direct sales, catalog marketing, and digital.

  <p>
   Brady has seen its revenues decline the last two years, with revenues dipping 4% from $1.17 billion in 2015 to $1.12 billion in 2016. The revenue drop was driven by an organic sales decline of 0.7% and a negative currency impact of 4% due to the strengthening of the US dollar against other major currencies. The decline in organic sales was attributed to reduced demand in the Americas and APAC regions. Organic sales in 2016 also declined in both the IDS and WPS segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's profits, however, absolutely skyrocketed from $3 million in 2015 to $80 million in 2016. In addition, Brady's cash flow from operations surged from $93 million to $139 million during that same time period. Both these increases were attributed to a lack of restructuring and impairment charges that it incurred in 2015.

  <p>
   Along with many of its peers, Brady has followed the electronics manufacturing industry overseas to take advantage of lower-cost production. International sales have grown as the firm continues to acquire non-US companies. International expansion remains a key strategic goal for Brady, which has facilities in about 30 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   One of the ways Brady wishes to grow its IDS segment is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its research and development (R&amp;D) capabilities. For its WPS segment, Brady is focused on workplace safety critical industries, new product offerings, and increased investment in its digital capabilities.

  <p>
   William H. Brady launched the W.H. Brady Co. in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, in 1914 as a maker of promotional materials for banks and other local businesses. Brady expanded into a wide range of advertising specialties, such as personalized calendars, punch cards, and signs. When Brady's son Bill took over the company in the 1940s, he began making wire markers from pressure-sensitive tape to provide a way to permanently identify wires in the electrical control systems of military planes and ships. The company subsequently expanded into safety signs and a variety of specialty products. The company moved to Milwaukee in 1953.
