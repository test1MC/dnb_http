  <p>
   Ethicon has been a strong growth segment for its parent, with rising sales in its biosurgical, suture, surgical mesh, and women's health and urology product lines. As a result, J&amp;J has been investing in the expansion of Ethicon's product offerings through a number of acquisitions, which in turn have further contributed to rising revenues for the unit. It expanded in the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) market by purchasing

   in 2010 for some $785 million. Acclarent, which makes minimally invasive devices for balloon sinuplasty (sinus surgery) procedures, operates as an autonomous division of Ethicon. The deal followed previous purchases of medical supplies maker Mentor Corporation (renamed
