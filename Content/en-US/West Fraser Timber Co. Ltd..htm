   West Fraser Timber Co. is a North American manufacturer of wood products that are marketed and sold worldwide. Its operations in Canada produce SPF (spruce-pine-fir) lumber; plywood, fibreboard, and veneer panels; and pulp and newsprint paper. Its sawmills in the southern US manufacture SYP (southern yellow pine) lumber and wood chips. In Alberta and British Columbia, the company holds licenses to harvest from timberlands controlled by Canadian provincial governments. In the US, Arkansas and Louisiana are key logging markets. The company traces its historical roots back to 1955.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates through three segments: lumber; panels; and pulp and paper. Lumber contributes about 65% of total sales, while pulp and paper generates around 25%. The remaining revenue stems from panels.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its operating subsidiaries include West Fraser Mills Ltd., West Fraser, Inc., Blue Ridge Lumber Inc., Sundre Forest Products Inc., and West Fraser Newsprint Ltd. Joint ventures include Alberta Newsprint Company and Cariboo Pulp &amp; Paper Company.

  <p>
   About half of the company's sales come from the US, followed by Canada, Asia, and Europe. It has 35 mills in Western Canada and the US.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   West Fraser serves retail outlets, wholesale distributors, remanufacturers, and treating businesses. The company sells its products through its sales locations and through its affiliates located across North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales to international markets are made from its export sales office in Vancouver, British Columbia. These sales efforts are complemented by customer service offices in China and Japan. Lumber produced at its US sawmills is marketed by its sales group in Memphis.
  </p>

  <p>
   West Fraser's revenues jumped 6% from 2014 to 2015. The growth was fueled by increased sales from its lumber and panels segments, as a result of a strong rebound in price. The upswing in the housing market, combined with continuing strong demand from Japan and China, also contributed to its growth. (Note: growth rates may differ after conversion to the US dollar.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits, however, plummeted 60% from 2014 to 2015 mainly due to higher operating expenses as a result of a spike in freight and other distribution costs and the presence of export taxes. Cash flow from operations also dipped by 37% due to changes in working capital driven by higher payables and accrued liabilities.
  </p>

  <p>
   Given the slower demand for lumber and other building products in the US, West Fraser is hoping Canada and Asia will provide relief. Lumber and pulp shipments to China are increasing because of urbanization and that country's growing economy. Meanwhile, the majority of its plywood panels are being purchased by customers in Canada, where homebuilding did not experience the same prolonged slowdown as the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   West Fraser is also exploring and developing new opportunities in bioenergy, biochemicals, and bioproducts. It also focuses on acquisitions and expansions, with a strategy to extend its existing business lines, particularly in lumber operations, and to product and geographic diversification.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2015, it obtained Manning Diversified Forest Products, which has sawmill operations located in Manning, Alberta, and related timber harvesting rights. The deal gave West Fraser access to an additional sawmill producing approximately 100 million board feet of lumber annually.

  <p>
   West Fraser was established when brothers Pete, Bill, and Sam Ketcham acquired a British Columbia lumber planing mill in 1955.
