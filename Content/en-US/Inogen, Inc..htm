   Combine innovation with oxygen and you've got Inogen. The company makes portable oxygen-concentrators that provide supplemental oxygen by people with chronic respiratory conditions. Oxygen concentrators pull nitrogen from ambient air to supply an oxygen-rich mix through a breathing tube. Its 4.8- and 7-pound models are meant to replace both large in-home concentrators as well as portable tank systems, which also eliminates the need for home delivery of oxygen tanks. Unlike most suppliers in the market, Inogen sells and rents directly to patients. International customers account for about a third of revenue. Inogen was formed in 2001 and went public in early 2014.

  <p>
   The company plans to use its $70.6 million in IPO proceeds to increase its rental-unit capacity, to improve and expand its manufacturing facilities, to expand its sales and marketing force, and for R&amp;D.

  <p>
   The majority of Inogen's revenue comes from consumer-direct supplies but it does operate though oxygen supply companies as well, mostly in international markets. A growing portion of its revenues come from equipment rental, which it prefers doing to the predictable and recurring nature of rental income. The company develops and manufacturers its products.

  <p>
   Inogen sells to more than 40 countries, mostly in Europe, and believes its product is poised to do well internationally for several reasons. Some countries, including the UK and France, have insurance or other payors that reimburse better for portable oxygen concentrators than the US while other countries have infrastructure (or a lack thereof) that makes a self-sustaining portable option best. And in some countries, including Australia, insurance doesn't pay for portable oxygen at all making light-weight mobility and low-cost key factors for customers who have to foot the bill themselves.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In the US, about 70% of sales, Inogen primarily markets directly to consumers while it uses mostly large oxygen supply distributors and gas companies overseas.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company believes its system gives it an advantage in the marketplace since traditional systems require a delivery network for regular replacement of oxygen tanks, making supply in rural areas difficult and costly. It markets directly to consumers to avoid the traditional model, which is geared toward delivering oxygen tanks or supplying large home concentrators.

  <p>
   Inogen recognizes revenue from sales, rentals, Medicare reimbursements, sales of used equipment, and from warranties, service contracts, and shipping markups (categorized as 'other'). In 2012 the company reported a 59% increase in total revenue as it sold and rented more units for higher prices. Accordingly, it went from a net loss of about 2 million to a modest gain of .6 million and cash flow improved about 5% as operating and financing activities both improved.

  <p>
   Going forward Inogen plans to leverage its direct relationship with costumers to improve existing products and develop new ones. It also intends to expand its sales and marketing efforts and sign contracts with private insurance and Medicaid.
