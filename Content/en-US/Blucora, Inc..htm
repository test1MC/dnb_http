   Why crawl the Web when others can do it for you? Blucora (formerly InfoSpace) operates through two businesses. Its InfoSpace unit consists of online search services that rely on its metasearch search technology. Owned and operated consumer websites include Dogpile.com, WebFetch.com, and MetaCrawler.com, which query such leading search providers as
   <company id="59101">
    Google
   </company>
   and
   <company id="48043">
    Yahoo!
   </company>
   , and then collate and rank those search results. InfoSpace also offers a private-label search product for businesses (which it calls distribution partners); it develops, hosts, and delivers search results for more than 100 distribution partners. Blucora acquired its other primary business, online tax solutions provider TaxACT, in 2012.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   About 80% of the company's search services revenue is generated through its distribution partners, many of which are mobile app developers. It has distribution and partnership agreements with search giants Google and Yahoo!, ensuring access to search results.

  <p>
   The company has enjoyed stable growth in its revenue since fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2014 its revenue increased by 1% to $580.72 million compared to $573.98 million in fiscal 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   The slight increase was primarily due to higher revenue from the company's E-Commerce and Tax preparation segments. Its Ecommerce segment revenue increased by 178% as a result of the acquisition of Monoprice in fiscal 2013. Tax preparation segment revenue increased by 14% due to an increase in consumer e-files, growth in average revenue per user, increased sales of bank services in the current year, and increasing payments over the past couple years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2014 Blucora posted a net loss of $35.55 million. It had net income of $24.40 million in fiscal 2013. The drop from a profit to a net loss was due to higher operating cost.
  </p>
  <p>
   Blucora's operating cash inflow decreased to $55.73 million in fiscal 2014 compared to $95.06 million in fiscal 2013. The decrease was primarily due to the net loss the company suffered in 2014.

   Blucora completed its acquisition of the assets and operations of HowStuffWorks during fiscal 2014. HowStuffWorks is a trusted digital information resource offering explanations for how the world actually works in thousands of topic areas.

  <p>
   Indian immigrant Naveen Jain, a veteran of Microsoft's online services unit, set out to create an interactive "people and business finder" in 1996. Eschewing funding from venture capitalists (disdainfully calling them "vulture capitalists"), the outspoken Jain launched his new enterprise, dubbed InfoSpace, with $250,000 of his own money. Its online phone directory service debuted in May, and a few months later it unveiled an online e-mail directory. Unlike most Internet players, InfoSpace wasn't looking to lure users to its own website (though it did have one). Instead, the company focused on supplying information to other sites.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the beginning of 1997 InfoSpace had added industry stalwarts Lycos (now owned by South Korea's
   <company id="135299">
    Daum Communications
   </company>
   ) and
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   to its customer list. That year it signed up @Home Network,
   <company id="11194">
    Playboy
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10472">
    Dow Jones
   </company>
   '
   <company id="103480">
    Wall Street Journal Online
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="52922">
    Go2Net
   </company>
   . The company's content also found its way to cable TV that year by way of InfoSpace's alliance with Source Media's Interactive Channel. InfoSpace continued expanding beyond traditional Internet customers, inking deals to feed its content to Motorola and SkyTel pagers, the
   <company id="12475">
    3Com
   </company>
   PalmPilot, and the AT&amp;T PocketNet service.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company secured two vital customers in 1998, signing
   <company id="15558">
    America Online
   </company>
   (AOL) and Netscape (later acquired by AOL) to content distribution deals. To get the agreements, however, InfoSpace had to pay AOL and Netscape to carry its content. Also in 1998 the company set up shop in the UK through a joint venture with
   <company id="134934">
    Thomson Directories
   </company>
   . It went public later that year as InfoSpace.com.
  </p>
  <p>
   After going public, the company entered into e-commerce agreements with
   <company id="57221">
    Cyberian Outpost
   </company>
   and Multiple Zones (now known as just
   <company id="51780">
    Zones
   </company>
   ). In 1999 it joined with Quote.com to create a financial content package. It later established a venture capital fund, launched its comparison shopping application ActiveShopper, and expanded into Canada and India. InfoSpace bolstered its wireless operations in 2000 through acquisitions of Saraide and Millet Software and signed agreements with GTE Wireless (now
   <company id="102492">
    Cingular
   </company>
   ) and
   <company id="55317">
    VeriSign
   </company>
   . The company later dropped the ".com" from its name and Jain handed the CEO title to Arun Sarin.
  </p>
  <p>
   In October InfoSpace expanded its infrastructure services and content offerings when it acquired online content company Go2Net for about $1.5 billion. The company's stock sank into the single digits, however, and a management shakeup led to the departures of its COO and CFO. Jain took back the CEO title from Sarin (who briefly served as vice chairman before resigning from the board) and realigned the company's focus on its core distribution products. The company later acquired Locus Dialogue, a developer of speech recognition technologies. In late 2002 one of the company's directors, Jim Voelker, replaced Jain as chairman and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   InfoSpace cut about 115 jobs and sold its Silicon Investor site in 2003. It also purchased mobile media company Moviso for some $25 million from the now defunct
   <company id="106353">
    Vivendi Universal Net USA Group
   </company>
   . The company formed a Media Studios business unit in order to house its Moviso acquisition.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later that year, Jain resigned from the board of directors after the company filed a lawsuit against him claiming his new company, Intelius, violated non-compete clauses. (The suit was dismissed the following year.) Also in 2003, in a separate case a US District Judge ruled that Jain violated federal law when he bought and sold millions of shares of InfoSpace stock within a six-month period. He was later ordered to pay a $247 million penalty. (Up until that point the largest award for that type of insider trading was $20 million.)
  </p>
  <p>
   InfoSpace sold its payment solutions business to Lightbridge (later renamed
   <company id="51554">
    Authorize.Net Holdings
   </company>
   ) in 2004 for $82 million and boosted its local directory offerings with the acquisition of
   <company id="99047">
    Switchboard
   </company>
   for $160 million. It also acquired mobile game creators Atlas Mobile and IOMO Limited.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 InfoSpace announced a restructuring plan as a response to revenue losses. The plan included 250 job cuts and the closing of its Hamburg, Germany, facility. Streamlining continued in 2007 with the company's sale of its online directory business, including Switchboard, to Idearc (now called
   <company id="112155">
    SuperMedia
   </company>
   ) for $225 million. Also in 2007 InfoSpace sold Media Studios (including Moviso) to FunMobility Inc. of Pleasanton, California, for an undisclosed price and its mobile services business for $135 million to
   <company id="112913">
    Motricity
   </company>
   , a provider of mobile content.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 it closed its European facilities. Jim Voelker retired as CEO early in 2009.  InfoSpace acquired Internet shopping service Mercantila in 2010, only to divest the business a year later. John Cunningham became chairman in early 2011, and Bill Ruckelshaus was named CEO later that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company changed its name from InfoSpace to Blucora in 2012, followng its acquisition of TaxACT for some $287.5 million.
