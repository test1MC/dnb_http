   Adam Opel is the heart of GM Europe. The company has been a subsidiary of
   <company id="10640">
    GM
   </company>
   for 90 years and is the core of GM's business in Europe. Opel's passenger cars (Astra, Zafira, Vectra, and electric Ampera), along with its light commercial vehicles (Combo and Movano) represent a vast majority of GM's total sales in Germany. Opel is the third most popular brand in Germany behind

   Opel is the first carmaker to introduce a carsharing concept for everyone. CarUnity allows for cars to be shared no matter whether they are made by Opel or another brand, enabling flexible, individual mobility throughout Germany. In 2015, Opel invested in the internet and app-based ridesharing platform flinc, extending Opel's mobility service offer throughout Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, in the company's largest model push in its history, Opel announced plans to introduce 27 new vehicles and 17 new engines by 2018. The brand entered new segments with vehicles such as the compact Mokka SUV, the small lifestyle ADAM and the elegant Cascada convertible. In September 2014 the new Opel KARL was officially announced, adding even more choice to a range of small cars that already included the ADAM and Corsa.

   The new Vivaro range was introduced at the Birmingham International Commercial Vehicle Show in April. Simultaneously the new Movano also made its debut. In September the versatile Opel Vivaro Combi was launched at a commercial vehicle show in Hanover.

   What happens to General Motors happens to Opel. GM's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009 left Opel's future hanging in the balance. China's Beijing Automotive Industry Holding (BAIC) announced intentions in mid-2011 to acquire Adam Opel. In the fall of 2009 GM announced that it would sell Adam Opel to
   <company id="47972">
    Magna International
   </company>
   , a Canadian-based auto parts supplier; however two months later the GM board decided not to sell the brand, opting to restructure its European operations instead. GM cited improving business conditions and the importance of the Opel and
   <company id="103617">
    Vauxhall
   </company>
   (Opel's UK-based brand) brands to its global strategy as reasons for scrapping the sale. Opel provides GM a small-car platform and engine technology that is more competitive in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   GM began restructuring activities for its Opel/Vauxhall operations in early 2010, which included idling Opel's Antwerp, Belgium, facility, cutting overall capacity by 20%, reducing headcount by 8,000 (about 17%), and slashing costs by as much as 30%. Opel is also changing its legal status to become a listed company named Adam Opel AG, which will give it more autonomy within GM. Opel workers have bought into the restructuring plan, but whether their contributions of more than €1 billion ($1.2 billion) are enough, remains to be seen.
  </p>
  <p>
   While GM hoped the German government would guarantee loans of about €3 billion (about $4.5 billion) to complete its restructuring of Opel, it experienced a backlash, resulting from its decision not to sell Opel to Magna -- the German government demanded its bridge loans to be returned. Later in the year when GM asked the German government for a €1 billion bailout, it was told that it would have to finance the ailing German unit itself. This raises questions about whether the company will be able to follow through on its plans. Still, Adam Opel insists that while restructuring costs will put a crimp in its bottom line over the next year, it does expect to see net profit by 2012.

   The company kept up with the Jonses and other automotive companies with electric vehicles. The Ampera, Opel's extended range electric car with GM Voltec technology, will be launched in 2011. Voltec electric propulsion technology allows the Ampera to run only on lithium-ion battery power for short trips up to 60 km and on electricity that is generated by a small internal combustion engine for longer distances.

   Opel was founded in 1862 by Adam Opel in Rüsselsheim, Germany.
