  <p>
   In fiscal 2014 Nagase's net revenues (in local currency) increased by 9%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales from Advanced Materials &amp; Processing increased mainly due to higher gross profit from revenue gains and better profitability among manufacturing subsidiaries that operate in the colors and imaging business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales from Functional Materials segment increased due to higher gross profit in Japan and Northeast Asia offset by decreased gross profit of manufacturing subsidiaries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales from electronic increased, but its operating profit decrease due to weak performance in thin-glass processing revenues in Northeast Asia that offset gross profit gains owing to higher touch panel materials sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Automotive &amp; Energy saw overall gains in net sales, with solid gains in automotive-related business revenues in Northeast Asia, the United States, Europe, and Japan, as well as growth in battery-related materials revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales from the Life &amp; Healthcare segment also grew.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2014, Nagase's net income declined by 18% due to an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses driven by higher  R&amp;D and manufacturing costs. In addition, a decrease in gain on sale of property, plant, and equipment also contributed to the drop in net income.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities decreased by 32% due to changes in notes and accounts receivable, inventories, exchange loss, and changes in gain on sales of property, plant and equipment plus increase in depreciation and amortization.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Facing rising oil and natural resources costs, Nagase is seeking to reduce its expenses and bring more efficiency to its operations in the mature market of Japan, while expanding in growth markets (including setting up new petrochemical plants in China, where it has 14 manufacturing companies) and in the Middle East.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is refocusing on quality and cost management in Advanced Materials &amp; Processing, and on new business products that make the most of the unique technological strengths of their customers. It is also focused on expanding and creating new plastics businesses, restructuring its overseas sales structure for trehalose (natural alpha-linked disaccharide) and building a more robust research and development function at the Nagase R&amp;D Center, specializing in biotechnology. It also plans to create a new parent division and support businesses for the company in specialty chemicals.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company will also continue to grow existing businesses through stronger relationships with their customers, select and focus development projects to bring current projects to the market faster and more clearly define their business portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nagase plans to work with major EMS manufacturers, focus on potential customers in leading Taiwanese, Chinese, and Korean companies, and leverage its close relationships with customers in Japan to develop more Japanese-affiliated customers and suppliers around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   Geographically, it plans to find new customers in the newly developing markets in China's interior, capture new demand in the emerging economics of  Southeast Asia, and work in cooperation with Nagase Plastics to grow business in Japan. It is also looking to continue to improve its global cooperative business structure and human resources training at local sales and manufacturing entities in Japan, Europe, the US, China and other Asian regions, South Korea, and ASEAN regions.
