   Nissan Motor, one of Japan's leading automakers, wants to get big by going small. Through its small-car initiative, the company primarily produces low-cost and fuel-efficient small cars with standard comfort, safety, style, and performance. Nissan's models include Maxima and Sentra cars, and Altima and Infiniti upscale sedans, as well as pickups, SUVs, and sports cars. It is also one of the world's largest manufacturers of forklifts.

   Nissan manufactures in about 20 countries and sells and services products in more than 160 countries. The company operates 14 production facilities in Japan, along with seven R&amp;D facilities. Its facilities are also spread across North America (five production facilities); Europe (four); Asia (13); Oceania (one); Mexico, Latin America, and Caribbean (five); and the Middle East, Gulf States, and Africa (two).

   Nissan's net sales increased 20% in 2014 compared to 2013, and its net income spiked by 14%. In Japan, total industry volumes rose by 9% to 5.7 million units as Nissan out-performed the market with unit sales up 11% to 719,000, representing a market share of 12%. This improvement was driven by strong sales of its DAYZ series, as well as strong demand for its first CMF model and the new X-Trail.
  </p>
  <p>
   In China, Nissan out-performed overall market growth. The total industry within China was up 14% to 20.75 million units, while Nissan sales increased 17% to 1.27 million units. Its Qashqai and the all-new Sylphy, along with new models from Venucia and Infiniti, contributed to the improvement. In North America, Nissan achieved significant sales growth. The total US industry was up 6% at 15.65 million units, while Nissan sales volume increased by 13% to 1.29 million units amid strong demand for the new Rogue and the Altima.

  <p>
   The Nissan Power 88 plan calls for attaining 8% global market share and an 8% operating profit margin by 2017. A major element of Power 88 is the development of about 90 new technologies, including a next-generation XTRONIC continuously variable transmission technology. The plan additionally includes investing 70% of research and development expenses into green technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nissan also has set a goal of increasing the percentage of fully built units that are locally made in the Americas to 85% by 2015. New plants in Brazil and Mexico are tasked with increasing production in the Americas from 1.2 million units a year in 2011 to 2 million units annually by 2014. The Great East Japan of Earthquake of 2011 and other contingencies also lead the company to create more efficient business continuity procedures for parts purchasing.

  <p>
   In 1911 US-trained Masujiro Hashimoto established Tokyo-based Kwaishinsha Motor Car Works to repair, import, and manufacture cars. Kwaishinsha made its first car, sporting its DAT ("fast rabbit" in Japanese) logo, in 1913. Renamed DAT Motors in 1925 and suffering from a strong domestic preference for American cars, the company consolidated with ailing Jitsuyo Motors in 1926. DAT introduced the son of DAT in 1931 -- the Datsun minicar ("son" means "damage or loss" in Japanese, hence the spelling change).
  </p>
  <p>
   Tobata Casting (cast iron and auto parts) bought Datsun's production facilities in 1933. Tobata's Yoshisuke Aikawa believed there was a niche for small cars, and the car operations were spun off as Nissan Motors that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWII the Japanese government limited Nissan's production to trucks and airplane engines; Nissan survived postwar occupation, in part, due to business with the
   <company id="150344">
    US Army
   </company>
   . The company went public in 1951 and signed a licensing agreement the next year with Austin Motor (UK), which put it back in the car business. A 40% import tax allowed Nissan to compete in Japan even though it had higher costs than those of foreign carmakers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nissan entered the US market in 1958 with the model 211, using the Datsun name; it established Nissan Motor Corporation in Los Angeles in 1960. Exports rose as factory automation led to higher quality and lower costs. In the 1970s Nissan expanded exports of fuel-efficient cars such as the Datsun B210. The company became the leading US car importer in 1975.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's name change in the US from Datsun to Nissan during the 1980s confused customers and took six years to complete. In 1986 Nissan became the first major Japanese carmaker to build its products in Europe. It launched its high-end Infiniti line in the US in 1989.
