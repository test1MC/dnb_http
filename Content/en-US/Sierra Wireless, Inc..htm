  <p>
   Sierra Wireless reported an 11% increase in revenue to $608 million in 2015 from $548 million in 2014. The increase came from OEM Solutions, which had better sales from automotive, energy, and enterprise networking customers as well as contributions from acquisitions Maingate, Accel, and MobiquiThings.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company cut its loss to $2.7 million on 2015 from $1.7 million in 2014. The higher sales, a lack of impairment charges, and a decrease in research and development costs helped reduce the loss.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations slowed to $14.5 million in 2015 from $48 million in 2014. The company has higher working capital requirements in 2015 because of purchases of an end of life component to be used in legacy OEM products and prepayment of an intellectual property license.
