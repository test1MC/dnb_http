   ZF Friedrichshafen (ZF) shifts easily from land to air to sea. The company makes automatic and manual transmissions for commercial vehicles, cars, aircraft, and marine vessels. ZF also makes rail transmissions and industrial drives such as servo gearboxes. Its off-road division makes transmissions for construction equipment and farm machinery. ZF's chassis unit makes automotive rear-axle systems and suspension modules. ZF was founded in 1915 by Ferdinand von Zeppelin (the Zeppelin inventor). The Zeppelin Stiftung Foundation, which is largely controlled by the town of Friedrichshafen, owns more than 90% of the company.

  <p>
   After the 1908 fiery demonstration of an early airship, Count Ferdinand Graf von Zeppelin thought he was ruined. However, despite its unfortunate fate, the airship's brief flight managed to captivate the interest of the citizens of Friedrichshafen, Germany. The townspeople donated funds to Count Zeppelin, raising more than 6 million German marks. He used the money to found Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH in 1908. The company was controlled by the Zeppelin Stiftung (founded by the count) for the town of Friedrichshafen.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1915 Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen GmbH (ZF) was created by Luftschiffbau Zeppelin for the development and manufacture of special gears for airships and other aircraft. Count Zeppelin died two years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   ZF was converted from a private firm to a stock corporation in 1921. To reflect the change, the company's name was changed to Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen AG. ZF AG developed the first helical-gear transmission in 1929. The company began producing automotive steering systems in 1932.
  </p>
  <p>
   Like much of Germany's industrial production capacity, Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen's operations were out of commission by the end of WWII. Reconstruction of the company's factories was completed in 1946, when production resumed with 1,000 workers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In accordance with the count's will, complete ownership of the Zeppelin Stiftung foundation was transferred to the city of Friedrichshafen in 1947. Three years later most of ZF's ownership (90%) was assigned to the Zeppelin Stiftung.
