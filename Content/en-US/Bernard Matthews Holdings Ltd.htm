   'Turkey is for life, not just for Christmas' could have been UK turkey king Bernard Matthews' mantra. The turkey producer, which made its name convincing UK shoppers to eat turkey year-round, sells fresh, chilled, and frozen turkey, as well as value-added turkey products. It makes and markets its products under the Bernard Matthews and Golden Norfolk brand names. The top processor and supplier in the UK, Bernard Matthews operates 56 turkey farms across Norfolk, Suffolk, and Lincolnshire. The company was founded by Bernard Matthews in 1950. Bernard Matthews ran into difficulties in 2013, going into administration, being acquired by Rutland Partners, before being bought by tycoon Ranjit Boparan in 2016.

   In fiscal 2015, ended June, Bernard Matthew's revenue fell 10% to £276.7 million. It narrowed the considerable loss incurred in fiscal 2014, from £13.7 million to £10.2 million, but the company's situation remains precarious.

   Bernard Matthews was acquired from Rutland by Ranjit Boparan, the man behind 2SistersFood group, in 2016 in a pre-pack deal worth £39 million.

   The company is trying to improve the image of turkey meat, which has gone out of fashion in the UK. The company's website features a "Why turkey meat?" section, pointing out its high protein/low fat nutrient composition.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company plans to cut 150 jobs at its Norfolk headquarters as a cost-cutting measure.
