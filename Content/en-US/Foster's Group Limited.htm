   A taste for Australian beer is quenched with Foster's, the suds of Foster's Group globally. Foster's operates through Carlton United Breweries, whose name-brand portfolio holds Foster's as well as Victoria Bitter, Carlton Draught, and Crown Lager. It has deals to sell rival brews
   <company id="46986">
    Asahi
   </company>
   and
   <company id="52130">
    Corona
   </company>
   in Australia. Foster's is also the country's #1 maker of cider. Offerings include spirits, Cascade soda, and Torquay bottled water. The lineup is sold in more than 45 countries. Foster's spun off its wine business,
   <company id="54453">
    Treasury Wine Estates
   </company>
   in 2011. The move made Foster's an acquisition target; following a hostile takeover battle, in 2011 the 150-year-old beer maker was bought by
   <company id="54451">
    SABMiller
   </company>
   in a roughly $12.3 billion bid.

  <p>
   Foster's grasp on Australia's beer market rests upon producing seven of the top 10 brands, including the country's #1 brew, Victoria Bitter. Beyond Australia, the group has licensed the Foster's brand to other brewers in many countries.

   SABMiller is working to run Foster's more cost-effectively.

   Upon finding that Australia's only beers were English-styled ales served at room temperature, American emigrants W. M. and R. R. Foster built a lager brewery near Melbourne in 1888 and gave customers ice to chill their Foster's Lager. The brothers began exporting in 1901 when Australians left to serve in the Boer War in South Africa. Carlton and United Breweries Proprietary (CUB) was formed in 1907 when the brothers merged their operations with five other breweries, including Victoria and Carlton.
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the years, CUB acquired stakes in trading company Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort and Henry Jones (IXL), a diversified food company owned by John Elliott. Faced with a takeover, in 1981 Elder Smith was merged into Henry Jones, forming Elders IXL. CUB became that firm's largest stockholder, with 49%, in 1983. Elders bought the rest of CUB in 1984.
  </p>
  <p>
   Elders expanded internationally with its purchases of UK's Courage Breweries (1986) and Canada's Carling O'Keefe Breweries (1987). In 1989 Carling O'Keefe and Molson formed a joint venture, Molson Breweries. To fight possible takeover attempts, that year Harlin Holdings (led by Elliott) offered to buy a 17% stake of Elders from two companies, but regulators forced the firm to extend its offer to all shareholders. As a result, Harlin ended up with more than 55% of Elders. The deal saddled Elders with debt, and in 1990 the company began selling its nonbrewing assets. Also that year Elliott resigned as chairman and CEO, and Elders changed its name to Foster's Brewing Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   Foster's purchased the brewing interests of Grand Metropolitan (now
   <company id="55181">
    Diageo
   </company>
   ) in 1991. Elliott's investment firm went bankrupt in 1992, and Australian conglomerate Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP), which also owned 19% of Elders, assumed control of its shares. (BHP sold its stake in 1997.) Also in 1992 Molson Breweries chief Ted Kunkel became CEO. He wrote off over $2 billion in nonbrewing assets that were still on the books and sold 10% of the brewer's interest in
   <company id="42382">
    Molson
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 Foster's sold its UK brewing operations to
   <company id="90370">
    Scottish &amp; Newcastle
   </company>
   . The next year it entered the wine business, buying Mildara Blass and Rothbury Wines, and in 1997 it entered the Australian wine-club business with the purchase of Cellarmaster Wines. The next year Foster's bought wine clubs Bourse du Vin International (the Netherlands) and 51% of Germany's Heinrich Maximilian Pallhuber (later acquiring the rest).
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 1998 Foster's sold its Canadian brewing interests -- 50% of Molson Breweries and 25% of Coors Canada -- to The Molson Companies (but retained a 25% interest in Molson USA). That year Foster's acquired the Austotel Trust hotel chain from Brierly Investments, making it the largest operator of hotels in Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Subsidiary Mildara Blass acquired the US direct wine marketer Windsor Vineyards in 2000; also, subsidiary Cellarmaster Wines bought a 25% interest in online wine retailer Wine Planet (increased in mid-2001 to about 90%). Foster's bought Beringer Wine Estates, a leading California winery, for about $1.2 billion. Wine profits for Foster's doubled in the year following the company's 2000 purchase of Beringer.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Foster's renamed its wine division Beringer Blass Wine Estates, merging the Beringer and Mildara Blass wine businesses. That year the company dropped "Brewing" from its official name, becoming Foster's Group Limited. In 2002
   <company id="54453">
    Beringer Blass Wine Estates
   </company>
   agreed to buy the Carmenet brand from Napa-based
   <company id="12943">
    Chalone Wine Group
   </company>
   (now part of Diageo Chateau &amp; Estate Wines Company). In 2002 sales of wine surpassed those of the company's beers for the first time.
  </p>
  <p>
   Foster's spun off its Australian Leisure and Hospitality group in November 2003, which included pubs, liquor shops, and interests in hotels and real estate development. That division became a separate company known as the
   <company id="128159">
    Australian Leisure &amp; Hospitality Group Ltd
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Foster's acquired a total of 91% of its rival, the premium winemaker
   <company id="103306">
    Southcorp
   </company>
   . It announced a bid to take over all of Southcorp, offering $4.14 per share. Foster's then upped its bid to $4.26 per share (or $2.48 billion) and, despite the objections of Southcorp's CEO (who later resigned), the winemaker's board accepted the offer. The acquisition, which added such brands as Lindemans, Penfolds, and Rosemount wines to Foster's portfolio, created one of the world's biggest global wine companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Foster's sold its namesake brand in Europe to
   <company id="90370">
    Scottish &amp; Newcastle
   </company>
   ; it also sold its loss-making Shanghai Brewery to
   <company id="52517">
    Suntory
   </company>
   that year. Reflecting its status as a global company, in 2007 Foster's restructured itself into three geographical divisions: Foster's Australia, Asia and Pacific; Foster's Americas; and Foster's Europe, Middle East, and Africa. That year it sold off most of its Wine Clubs and Services businesses, as well as its Kent Brewery.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company was fined A$1 million (about the same in US dollars) for failing to repair a machine that caused a worker's death. The accident happened at Foster's Abbotsford brewery in 2006 when, in a repeat of a similar incident several years earlier, a machine operator's head became jammed in a bottling machine. Foster's pleaded guilty to failing to maintain a safe workplace and to provide adequate worker training and supervision.
  </p>
  <p>
   Foster's Group rejected an offer in 2011 to purchase its wine business, despite the fact that sales had dropped as a result of the global financial malaise. (Several US private equity firms were believed to be among the suitors.) It is interested in divesting CUB, not wine, operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company spun off its Treasury Wine Estates business as a public company on the Australian Securities Exchange.
