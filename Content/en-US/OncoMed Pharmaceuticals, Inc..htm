   OncoMed Pharmaceuticals is a development-stage biotech company working to produce pharmaceuticals targeting cancer cells. Like a growing group of pharma firms, its work is focused on cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are believed to be the root cause of cancer tumors. Traditional chemotherapy may kill the tumors but leaves the CSCs to grow more tumors. OncoMed's antibody drugs target both CSCs and the tumors they produce. The company has seven candidates in development, including demcizumab, tarextumab, brontictuzumab, and vantictumab; it has strategic alliances with major pharma companies

   Demcizumab is a monoclonal antibody the company is developing in collaboration with Celgene. The partners are also working on two other treatments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tarextumab, another monoclonal antibody in clinical trials, is being developed with GSK. OncoMed is also working with GSK to develop Bronticuzumab, a novel anti-cancer stem cell antibody. Other candidates include Vantictumab and Ipafricept (both part of its collaboration with Bayer).
  </p>
  <p>
   OncoMed does not manufacture its candidates but rather has agreements with third-party contract manufacturing organizations for product supplies.

   The company has lost money every year since its inception as its research and development expenses as well as general and administrative expenses continue to rise. In 2015 its net loss increased 71% to $85 million. As of the end of 2015, OncoMed had an accumulated deficit of $309.8 million.
  </p>

   Cash outflow from operations declined 11% to $75 million that year, as cash was generated from deferred revenue as a result of the achievement of a $70 million safety milestone from Celgene.
