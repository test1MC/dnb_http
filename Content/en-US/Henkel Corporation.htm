   Henkel's operations consist of the North American market for laundry and home care (detergents and cleaning products), beauty care (products for the body, skin, and oral care, and hair salon business), and adhesive technologies (decoration and renovation products). The structure, which is supported by four US R&amp;D sites, is intended to flex for growth in a positive market yet provide stability in a downturn.

   Its primary direct customer group is the grocery retail trade with distribution channels in the form of supermarkets, large-scale mass merchandisers/hypermarkets, and discount stores. Adhesive technologies serves a wide range of customers with different uses for their products. Customers range from large international industrial clients to small and medium-sized industrial businesses, craftsmen, do-it-yourselfers, and private households.
