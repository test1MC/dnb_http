   The Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company chews up the competition as the world's #1 maker of chewing gum. The company's products include such popular chewing gums as Big Red, Doublemint, Spearmint, Eclipse, Extra, and Juicy Fruit, as well as novelty gums Hubba Bubba and other kid-friendly gums. Wrigley's non-gum items include breath mints Altoids and Velamints and candies Creme Savers and Life Savers. As part of its business, Wrigley also makes chewing-gum bases for other companies as a supplier to the ingredients sector. Owned by confectionery giant

   , Wrigley boasts operations in more than 50 countries and sells its products in about 180 countries worldwide.

  <p>
   The chewing gum maker is headquartered on Goose Island, located on the Chicago River, and is home to some 600 employees.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company in 2012 left its landmark headquarters building on Chicago's Michigan Avenue and relocated to Goose Island, where the gum maker operates its $57-million, Gold LEED-certified Global Innovation Center. Wrigley had operated out of the Wrigley Building since the 1920s. The newer Goose Island location gives Wrigley space and facilities that are more conducive to innovation, collaboration, and creativity. Nearby facilities give Wrigley more than 360,000 sq. ft. of office and lab space on Goose Island for its Engineering Technology and Information Technology Centers.

   Wrigley operates worldwide in 50-plus countries and sells products in 180 countries. It distributes its products to the Americas, Europe, Russia, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific Region.

   Wrigley conducts its marketing and distribution activities through Mars as a way to increase synergies and cost savings. After buying Wrigley, Mars gave Wrigley its non-chocolate candy brands, such as Starburst and Skittles. Its brands portfolio also consists of Extra, Orbit, Doublemint, and five chewing gums, as well as confectionery brands Altoids and Life Savers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has 17,000 associates globally.

  <p>
   Under parent Mars, the company has worked to produce add-on products to its existing brands by introducing new packaging and flavor enhancements. Wrigley has launched several new flavors for its Extra Dessert Delights gum, rolled out a Skittles Blenders chew candy in five new flavors, and developed Life Savers Mints Bottles. Similar to the custom M&amp;M's product offered by Mars, Wrigley has rolled out a MyExtra gum, an Extra-branded sugar-free gum that can be personalized with photos or designs for weddings, baby showers, birthdays, and other events.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's also strategically restructuring its operations. In early 2015, for example, parent-company Mars announced that it would shut down its Wrigley gum factory in Toronto as part of its supply-chain reorganization plans in North America. However, Wrigley also recently announced that it is investing some $50 million to expand its Yorkville plant in Illinois by 145,000 sq. ft., to begin production by the end of 2015. In mid-2014, Wrigley announced that it would add the production of popular candy brand Skittles to its Yorkville facility.

   The founding Wrigley family sold the company to
   <company id="40297">
    Mars
   </company>
   in 2008. The takeover, valued at some $23 billion, united two iconic US companies, each of which already had a substantial global presence. Wrigley became a private, stand-alone subsidiary of Mars, relieving it of the costs and constraints of being a public company. Warren Buffett's
   <company id="10206">
    Berkshire Hathaway
   </company>
   helped finance the takeover by Mars and owned a more than 10% interest in Wrigley.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   William Wrigley Jr. started his career in 1889 at age 13, when his father put him to work at the family's soap factory in Philadelphia following the boy's expulsion from school. After a year Wrigley was promoted to the sales staff, and in 1891 he went to Chicago to establish himself as a salesman of his father's soap and other products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wrigley promoted products with free premiums. When he began offering customers chewing gum (made of spruce gum and paraffin by Zeno Manufacturing) in 1892, he received numerous requests to sell the gum. At the time chicle (a naturally sweet gum base from Central America) was being imported for the rubber industry. Wrigley gambled on the idea that chicle would work as a main ingredient in chewing gum.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1898 he merged with Zeno to form Wm. Wrigley, Jr. &amp; Co. By 1910 Spearmint gum was the leading US brand; Wrigley introduced Doublemint gum four years later. The company expanded into Canada in 1910, Australia in 1915, and the UK in 1927.
  </p>
  <p>
   Keen on advertising, Wrigley plastered simple messages on huge billboards and used twins to promote Doublemint gum. The Wrigley family bought Santa Catalina Island (1919), built the Wrigley Building (1924), and purchased the
   <company id="46719">
    Chicago Cubs
   </company>
   (1924). By 1932, when William died and his son Philip ("P. K.") took over, the company was the largest single-product advertiser.
  </p>
  <p>
   For over 75 years Wrigley made only Spearmint, Juicy Fruit, and Doublemint. Unable to obtain the proper ingredients during WWII, Wrigley produced inferior gum under a different label, but he kept the Wrigley brand alive with a picture of his former gum and the ad slogan "Remember This Wrapper." It worked. After the war Wrigley's popularity increased. It bought
   <company id="122290">
    Amurol Confections
   </company>
   in 1958. P. K.'s son William joined the company at age 23 and became CEO in 1961 (P. K. remained as chairman). The company did not raise its original five-cent price until 1971, when management grudgingly went to seven cents.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1974 Wrigley faced competition from sugar-free gums. At first management refused to bring out a sugar-free gum, instead introducing Freedent for denture wearers. Later the company introduced Big Red (1975); Orbit, a sugar-free gum (1977); and Hubba Bubba (1978). P. K. died in 1977 (as did his wife); his son sold the family's majority stake in the Cubs in 1981 to meet the resulting estate-tax burden.
  </p>
  <p>
   Three years later Wrigley introduced a new sugar-free gum, Extra. Wrigley established operations in Eastern Europe and opened a new factory in China in 1993. The next year it launched Winterfresh, its first new sugar-based gum in nearly 20 years. By 1996 the new gum was second only to Doublemint in popularity in the US. The company in 1997 returned to the "double your pleasure, double your fun" advertising for its Doublemint brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wrigley introduced its Eclipse pellet gum in 1999 to counter the growing popularity of breath mints. That March, William died; his son Bill was named president and CEO, the fourth generation at the helm. In 2000 the company began testing gums containing cough suppressants, decongestants, and teeth whiteners.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 it bought Velamints, a brand of breath mints, from Ragold. Wrigley also purchased selected assets, including the manufacturing operations, of Gum Tech International's gum and confectionery business for $25 million. In addition, the company launched an antacid gum, Surpass, the sales of which proved to be disappointing. (The company ceased manufacturing Surpass in 2003.) However, with the introduction that year of new products such as X-Cite, a cross between a mint and gum, and the teeth-whitening gum Orbit White, new products sales accounted for nearly 20% of Wrigley's 2001 total sales. In 2002 Wrigley's $12.5 billion bid for
   <company id="10722">
    The Hershey Company
   </company>
   was rejected when the controversial Hershey sale was called off.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company added to its non-gum mint offerings in 2003, introducing Extra sugar-free mints. That year Wrigley was granted a patent for a chewing gum that contains the active ingredient in Viagra. However, since Viagra's manufacturer,
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   , holds the drug's patent until the year 2011, Wrigley has no immediate plans to introduce the gum.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2003 the company announced a number of officer changes, the most significant being that Bill Wrigley became chairman (a post that had been vacant for more than 25 years) as well as CEO. In addition, CFO Ronald Waters took on the additional title and duties of COO. The management changes were part of a Wrigley restructuring that the company hoped would put it in a better position to effect mergers and acquisitions, as well as allow it to grow internally.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wrigley bought the Spanish food company Agrolimen's Joyco's confectionery business in 2004 for $260 million. Brands added to the Wrigley stable included Boomer bubble gum, Pim Pom lollipops, and Solano candies, along with Joyco's gum-base operations. Having lost some US market share to archrival Cadbury, Wrigley decided to emphasize new products, shooting the percentage they account for up to 20% from 5% in previous years. In 2005 the company opened a $45-million Global Innovation Center and introduced seven new products (the biggest product expansion in the company's 100-plus-year history).
  </p>
  <p>
   As rival
   <company id="103392">
    Kraft Foods
   </company>
   sought to lighten its company load, in 2005 Wrigley purchased Kraft's popular LifeSavers, Crème Savers, and Altoids confectionery brands. The $1.4 billion deal also included the candy stand.com website, some smaller regional brands, and production facilities in the US and Europe. Later that year the company sold Trolli gummy candy, which was part of the Kraft deal, to
   <company id="117773">
    Farley's &amp; Sathers
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 a former CEO of
   <company id="14254">
    NIKE
   </company>
   , William Perez, was named president, CEO, and board member of Wrigley, succeeding Bill Wrigley Jr. Perez, who had also been CEO of
   <company id="40403">
    S.C. Johnson
   </company>
   , was the first non-Wrigley-family-member to run the company. Fourth-generation Wrigley remained with the company as chairman. The company hired its first-ever chief marketing officer that year as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   The chewing gum company first took the plunge into the chocolate vat in 2007, when it acquired 80% of the Russian chocolate company A. Korkunov. The purchase price was $330 million. The company makes premium chocolates and its namesake brand, A. Korkunov, is the top-seller in the Russian premium-chocolate sector.
  </p>
  <p>
   The founding Wrigley family sold the company to confectionery leader Mars in 2008 in a deal valued at some $23 billion. As a result, Wrigley became a private, stand-alone subsidiary of Mars.
