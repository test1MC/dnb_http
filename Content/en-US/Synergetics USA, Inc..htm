   Synergetics USA is in sync with surgeons' needs. The firm makes microsurgical instruments and electrosurgery systems used in minimally invasive surgeries, primarily in the fields of ophthalmology and neurology. Among its products are forceps, retractors, scissors, and illuminators used in vitreoretinal surgeries, as well as precision neurosurgery instruments. It also makes bipolar electrosurgical generators, which use electrical currents to cut tissue and seal blood vessels. Synergetics USA sells to hospitals, physicians, and clinics directly and through distributors; it also sells certain items through partnerships with original equipment manufacturers.

  <p>
   While Synergetics USA sells its products in more than 60 countries, the domestic US market accounts for more than 70% of the company's annual revenues.

  <p>
   About 80% of Synergetics USA's revenues come from sales of disposable products, primarily in the ophthalmics segment, while the remaining earnings come from capital equipment sales.

  <p>
   Ophthalmic products are sold through direct sales forces and distribution partners, as well as select OEM partners. The firm distributes a majority of its neurosurgery instruments and electrosurgery generators through two OEM marketing partners,
   <company id="104021">
    Codman &amp; Shurtleff
   </company>
   and
   <company id="14815">
    Stryker
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   Synergetics USA reported revenues of some $60 million in 2012, a 7% increase over the previous year's results. Much of the increase was a result of new or expanded agreements with OEM distributors, as well as from increased sales of new disposable ophthalmic products. Net income declined slightly (less than 1%) to some $5.6 million due to increased sales, marketing, and administrative expenses, as well as a loss from discontinued operations.

  <p>
   Synergetics USA aims to grow through the development of new products and the expansion of its customer base. The company has about 25 projects in its R&amp;D pipeline, primarily for new ophthalmic products in the vitreoretinal device market. In addition, the firm works to find new OEM partners that integrate Synergetics USA products into their own products. It has expanded its relationship with Codman &amp; Shurtleff in recent years by granting the partner exclusive rights to sell certain forceps and generator products. Synergetics USA also formed a licensing agreement with eye care company Mobius in 2012 to manufacture the administration kits for its newly approved glaucoma treatment. However, the company's partnership with
   <company id="89515">
    Alcon
   </company>
   ended that same year.

  <p>
   At the same time, Synergetics USA has been working to streamline its manufacturing, supply chain, sales, and technology organizations. It exited its plastic injection molding operations in 2012. Synergetics USA also sold its line of Omni ultrasonic aspirators, which are used to remove tumors, to Stryker in 2010; through the deal, the firm continues to supply disposable aspirator tips and other consumables and will work with Stryker on new versions of the product line.

  <p>
   Synergetics USA was formed when Valley Forge Scientific (a maker of electrosurgical generators) and Synergetics (which made microsurgical instruments) merged in 2005.
