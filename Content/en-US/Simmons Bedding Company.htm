   Based in Atlanta, Simmons Bedding has grown to become one of the world's largest makers and marketers of mattresses. To support its business, it maintains about 20 conventional bedding manufacturing facilities throughout the US, Canada, and Puerto Rico.

   The company's products portfolio includes numerous brand names, such as Beautyrest, Beautyrest Black, Beautyrest NxG, ComforPedic by Simmons, ComforPedic Loft, Natural Care, and BeautySleep. Simmons peddles its mattresses and bedding items through furniture outlets, department stores, and specialty shops.

  <p>
   Innovation is key in the competitive mattress market, both as a way to convince consumers to replace their mattresses more frequently and for Simmons to differentiate itself from its rivals. To that end, new products launches are important. In 2014 Simmons introduced a new product line: the smart, self-adjusting ConforPedic iQ that features a patented, clinically tested Smart Response Technology, which responds and continually adjusts to the body. The firm over the years has also rolled out its Beautyrest and ComforPedic from Beautyrest collections.

   Simmons makes most of its revenue through wholesale sales of its innerspring mattresses. The manufacturer partners with other US and Canadian manufacturers by licensing its brand names for bedding accessories, furniture, and air beds. For items sold outside the region, Simmons enlists third-party manufacturers to produce its branded goods.

   In addition to its manufacturing and licensing operations, Simmons distributes mattresses and other bedding to the hospitality industry (
