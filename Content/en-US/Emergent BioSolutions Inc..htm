   Emergent BioSolutions is preparing for a bioterrorism or pandemic worst-case scenario. The company develops and produces vaccines that treat or protect against infectious diseases and bio-agents. The company supplies BioThrax (the US's only
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   -approved anthrax vaccine) primarily to the
   <company id="105717">
    US Department of Defense
   </company>
   (DOD),
   <company id="104757">
    Centers for Disease Control
   </company>
   (CDC), and the
   <company id="150448">
    US Department of Health and Human Services
   </company>
   (HHS). It is also developing a post-exposure treatment for anthrax. In 2016 the firm spun off its biosciences division, which works on therapies for leukemia and lymphona and vaccines for such infectious diseases as influenza, as the new public company Aptevo Therapeutics.

  <p>
   Prior to the split, Emergent BioSolutions operated in two segments: Biodefense (more than 80% of revenue) and Biosciences. The Biodefense segment focuses on chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives threats, while Biosciences focused on therapeutics and vaccines in hematology, cancer, transplantation, infectious disease, and autoimmunity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Products marketed by Biodefense include BioThrax, BAT (the only FDA-approved heptavalent for the treatment of botulinum disease), Anthrasil (pending approval for the treatment of anthrax), VIGIV (the only FDA-licensed therapeutic addressing adverse effects of smallpox vaccination), and Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion, or RSDL (for the removal or neutralization of chemical agents from the skin). Its investigational candidates are anthrax vaccines NuThrax and PreviThrax, and GC-072, the lead compound in the EV-035 series of broad spectrum antibiotics (acquired from
   <company id="183951">
    Evolva
   </company>
   in late 2014).
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanshile, the Biosciences' portfolio comprised four products acquired with
   <company id="103201">
    Cangene Corporation
   </company>
   in 2014 (WinRho SDF for the treatment of autoimmune platelet disorder, HepaGam for the treatment of hepatitis B, VARIZIG for the treatment of chicken pox and shingles, and episil for pain relief) as well as investigational state candidates (IXINITY for bleeding episodes in people with hemophilia B, ES414 for the treatment of prostate cancer, and otlertuzumab for chronic lymphocytic leukemia). Biosciences also provided contract manufacturing services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Emergent BioSolutions contracts with a third-party filling laboratory to measure BioThrax into dosage vials.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company manufactures BioThrax at its production facility in Lansing, Michigan. It also operates offices and laboratories in Maryland and Washington, as well as in Germany. With its acquisition of Cangene Corporation in 2014, the company gained facilities in Winnipeg, Manitoba in Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   International markets include Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia/Pacific region.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company markets its products primarily to US, state, and local governments and domestic non-governmental organizations. The US is the primary buyer of its Biodefense products, providing funding for the development of drug candidates.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its commercial operations team focuses on selling to hospitals, hematology clinics, medical oncology clinics, and transplant centers. Products are distributed in the US through wholesalers including
   <company id="12894">
    Cardinal Health

   ,
   <company id="10977">
    McKesson
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="40016">
    AmerisourceBergen
   </company>
   . In Canada, commercial products are distributed exclusively by Canadian Blood Services and Héma-Québec.

  <p>
   Revenues had been growing slowly until 2014, when they rose 44% to $450.1 million on higher product sales, contract manufacturing business, and contracts, grants, and collaborations. The firm's RSDL product had increased sales that year; additionally, products and contract manufacturing business gained from the Cangene acquisition provided new revenue sources. Finally, contracts, grants, and collaborations revenues increased due to funding for the development of Anthrasil and BAT, both acquired during 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has followed revenue trends. In 2014 it rose 18% to $37 million, driven by the higher revenue but partially offset by a decrease in other income. Cash flow from operations rose 16% to $112 million due to an increase in cash provided by inventories and other factors.

  <p>
   While Emergent BioSolutions dominates the anthrax vaccine niche, its focus on a single niche product can leave it vulnerable to fluctuations in demand from a relatively narrow customer base. To reduce its vulnerability, the company has broadened its customer base in recent years to include state and local governments (who might want their own stockpiles for first responders) as well as foreign governments. It has also built up its non-anthrax pipeline through acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's overall product development strategy includes acquiring new candidates through company acquisitions and in-licensing transactions. In 2013, it bought the Healthcare Protective Products Division of Bracco Diagnostics Inc. and added the division's RSDL to its product offerings. Two years later it acquired biopharmaceutical Cangene Corporation, adding BAT, Anthrasil, VIGIV, WinRho, Hepagam, VARIZIG to its portfolio. In addition to its acquisitions, the company has also divested its stake in a tuberculosis vaccine candidate and saw Pfizer terminate a collaboration agreement related to the development of a rheumatoid arthritis treatment and Abbott Laboratories terminate a collaboration for development of a leukemia treatment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the FDA approved IXINITY and AIGIV for the treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia B and inhalational anthrax, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   Emergent BioSolutions entered into an agreement with MorphSys in 2014; they will co-develop and commercialize the novel oncology immunotherapeutic MOR 209/ES414, which targets prostate cancer.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company spun off its Biosciences division into Aptevo Therapeutics, a separate, stand-alone public company. The move allows each division to operate as pure-play companies with separate areas of focus.

  <p>
   In early 2014, the company acquired biopharmaceutical company Cangene Corporation for $222 million. The move substantially expanded its product portfolio and contract manufacturing capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year, it acquired the EV-035 series of molecules from Evolva Holding; the novel small molecules target bacterial type IIa topoisomerase.
