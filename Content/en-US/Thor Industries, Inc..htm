   Thor Industries is a recreation vehicle builder that makes and sells a range of RVs, from motor homes to travel trailers, as well as related parts. Brands include Airstream and Dutchmen. RV manufacturing plants generally produce vehicles to dealer order; Thor's independent dealers dot the US and Canada catering to private purchasers and municipalities. The company has domestic facilities in Idaho, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Oregon. The US is its largest market, accounting for 90% of total sales. Thor rolled out in 1980 when Wade Thompson and Peter Orthwein purchased

  <p>
   Thor has two reportable segments: towable recreation vehicles (about three-quarters of revenue; travel trailers, fifth wheels, and motor homes) and motorized recreation vehicles (about 25%).

   Thor has facilities in the US (Idaho, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Oregon) and Canada; the US accounts for nearly 90% of sales.

  <p>
   Thor sells its products through a limited amount of consumer-oriented advertising for its recreation vehicles, primarily in industry magazines, product brochures, direct mail advertising campaigns, and on the Internet. The company markets its products through some 2,200 independent dealerships carrying its products in the US and Canada. The company's dealer,
   <company id="135094">
    FreedomRoads
   </company>
   , accounted for 20% of its revenue in fiscal 2016 (ended July).

  <p>
   Thor has achieved unprecedented growth over the last few years. Revenues climbed 14% from $4 billion in 2015 to peak at a record-setting $4.58 billion in 2016. The historic growth was driven by a 8% rise in towables sales and a 26% spike in motorized sales driven by acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thor's profits also surged, jumping 29% from $199 million in 2015 to $256 million in 2016, another company milestone. The company's operating cash flow had steadily climbed over the past few years, jumping by 38% from 2015 to 2016 on positive changes in accounts receivable and inventories.

  <p>
   Thor's strategy is governed by strategic acquisitions and product introductions. RVs continue to be its mainstay line in terms of revenue as the RV industry enters its six year of recovery after the US recession according to the RV Industry Association.
  </p>
  <p>
   To power organic growth, the company spent more than $42 million in fiscal 2015 to expand facilities and build new plants to support the Heartland and Airstream brands, among others.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2016, Thor launched its Airstream Basecamp, a sleek, silver RV of aluminum that can be towed behind a truck. It contains one massive panoramic window, solar power, Italian cabinetry, and a Bose Bluetooth speaker system.

  <p>
   Thor has achieved record-setting revenue growth over the years, mainly through the use of acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the summer of 2016, Thor acquired
   <company id="109684">
    Jayco
   </company>
   for approximately $576 million. The transaction enhanced Thor's main portfolio as Jayco manufactures camping trailers, light-weight trailers, park and travel trailers, fifth-wheels, toy haulers, and motor homes through a network of more than 300 authorized dealers in the US and Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also saw success with a couple of acquisitions in 2015, including the purchases of towable RV maker Cruiser RV and luxury fifth wheel RV maker DRV for $47.5 million. It also bought Postle Aluminum, an RV components supplier, for $144 million.

  <p>
   Mergers and acquisitions specialist Wade Thompson and investment banker Peter Orthwein saw the potential of the RV market after buying Hi-Lo Trailer in 1977. Thor Industries was formed when they bought the troubled Airstream Trailers unit (founded in 1931) from Beatrice Foods in 1980. Named after the mythical Norse god of thunder and containing the first two letters of the founders' last names, Thor Industries went public in 1984.
