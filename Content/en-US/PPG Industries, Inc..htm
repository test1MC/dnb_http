   Thanks to its extensive range of paints, coatings, and other product offerings, you won't catch PPG Industries painting itself into a corner. Performance and industrial coatings -- such as paints (Pittsburgh Paints, Comex, and SIGMA), stains (Olympic), and sealants -- account for most of its sales; the remainder comes from glass materials. PPG's glass offerings include flat glass for buildings, fabricated glass, and continuous-strand fiberglass used in aircraft and buildings. The company has sold its chemical commodities and optical products businesses in order to focus on its core coating and glass segments.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   PPG operates 156 manufacturing facilities in 42 countries worldwide and owns 2,149 retail centers in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, the UK, and Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company generated 56% of its sales from the Americas (of which US alone accounts to 42%); EMEA, 28%; and Asia-Pacific, 16%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   PPG operates through three business segments:
  </p>
  <p>
   Performance Coatings (refinish, aerospace, protective and marine and architectural - Americas and Asia-Pacific coatings, and architectural - EMEA coatings businesses). This segment accounted for 57% of PPG's 2015 revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Industrial Coatings (36%, automotive OEM, industrial and packaging coatings, and specialty coatings and materials businesses)
  </p>
  <p>
   Glass (7%, flat glass and continuous-strand fiber glass products).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   PPG sells its products through company-owned stores, home centers and other regional or national consumer retail outlets, paint dealers, concessionaires and independent distributors. It also sells directly to customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Industrial Coatings and glass products are sold directly to a variety of manufacturing companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the company's coating and related products are also sold through more than 4,000 stores that are independently owned and operated by more than 700 concessionaires, primarily in Mexico.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 PPG's advertising costs were $324 million compared to $297 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 PPG's net revenues decreased by 0.2% due to unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by an increase in sales from acquired business,
   <company id="105224">
    Comex
   </company>
   (Mexico's top paint supplier); and increased sales volumes, primarily in emerging countries and EMEA.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from Performance Coatings increased due to net sales from acquisitions (9%), largely Comex, modestly higher selling prices, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and lower sales volumes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Industrial Coatings sales decreased due to unfavorable foreign currency translation and lower sales prices, partially offset by acquired businesses and higher sales volume with growth in all regions, led by Asia-Pacific and EMEA.
  </p>
  <p>
   Glass segment net sales dropped due to lower sales stemming from a 2014 flat glass production facility divestiture, and unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by higher selling prices and sales volumes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 PPG's net income decreased by 33% due to business restructuring costs related to recent acquisitions, an increase in income tax expenses, and lower income from discontinued operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash flow increased by 20% due to changes in accounts payable, inventories, and taxes and interest payable.
  </p>

  <p>
   PPG generates most of its revenues outside the US, and the company is focusing on acquiring additional businesses and entering into additional joint ventures to grow its global business portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   For 2015 and 2016 combined, the company announced plans to deploy cash of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion for acquisitions and share repurchases and also plans to make capital investments to expand production capacity and strengthen its capacity to serve customers in several growing markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it expanded the ability of its Central Europe application support center in Hamburg, Germany, to package aerospace sealants for customers in Central and Eastern Europe by adding equipment to provide premixed and frozen sealant, SEMKIT packages as well as Customized Sealant Solutions products such as PRC seal caps and PRC SEMFOAM sealant.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year, PPG's architectural coatings business in China launched a mobile website on the WeChat public platform for the MASTER'S MARK paint brand, the first mobile website PPG has launched on Chinese social media. That year it also launched a new website for TESLIN substrate, a ruggedly durable synthetic paper that, because of its microporous structure, offers an exclusive combination of performance benefits that cannot be replicated by other printable plastics.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company expanded its aerospace business operations in Japan by relocating its application support center to a site in Miyoshi that supports increased production capacity, adds warehouse space and affords new service capabilities. The larger site, near Nagoya, enables PPG Aerospace to expand its capabilities in the region.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, PPG agreed to sell its Mt. Zion, Illinois, glass manufacturing facility to automotive glass maker Fuyao Glass America Inc. The sale is consistent with the strategic initiative by PPG's flat glass business to focus on its higher-technology, coated glass capabilities for residential and commercial construction application.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash to pay down debt, in 2013 PPG spun off its commodity chemicals business and merged it with Georgia Gulf in a cash and stock deal valued at $2.1 billion. The transaction earned PPG a majority interest of about 50.5% in the combined company which is the third-largest chlor-alkali and the second-largest vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) producer in North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year PPG divested its 51% ownership of photochromic lenses joint venture supplier Transitions Optical (and 100% of PPG's optical sunlens business) to
   <company id="90714">
    Essilor
   </company>
   . The transaction reflects an enterprise value of $3.4 billion.

  <p>
   In 2016 PPG acquired US-based coatings services business
   <company id="109572">
    MetoKote Corporation
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company expanded its geographic footprint in France with acquisition of Le Joint Français SNC, and expanded its portfolio of offerings with acquisition of Cuming Microwave.
  </p>
  <p>
   It bought automotive and aerospace sealants and adhesives business of Le Joint Français SNC (LJF), a France-based specialty sealants and adhesives manufacturer; Cuming Microwave Corporation (supplier of specialty coatings and materials) based in Avon, Massachusetts and its subsidiary Cuming-Lehman Chambers, Inc., based in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania; and Consorcio Latinoamericano, which operates a network of 57 paint stores in Central America which added company owned-stores across Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Panama under Performance Coatings segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In total, the company completed six smaller acquisitions during 2015 to further strengthen its product, technology, and distribution offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 PPG acquired giant Mexican paints maker Comex for $2.3 billion, making PPG the largest coatings company in the world.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   After the failure of his first two plate-glass manufacturing plants, John Ford persuaded former railroad superintendent John Pitcairn to invest $200,000 in a third factory in 1883 in Creighton, Pennsylvania. The enterprise, Pittsburgh Plate Glass (PPG), became the first commercially successful US plate-glass factory.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ford left in 1896 after Pitcairn established a company distribution system, replacing glass jobbers. Ford went on to found a predecessor of competitor Libbey-Owens-Ford (now owned by glassmaker
   <company id="42956">
    Pilkington
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   Pitcairn built a soda ash plant in 1899, bought a Milwaukee paint company the following year, and began producing window glass in 1908. Pitcairn died in 1916, leaving his stock to his sons.
  </p>
  <p>
   Strong automobile and construction markets in the early 20th century increased demand for the company's products. In 1924 PPG revolutionized glass production with the introduction of a straight-line conveyor manufacturing method. In the 1930s and 1940s, PPG successfully promoted structural glass for use in the commercial construction industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   PPG was listed on the NYSE in 1945. In 1952 it started making fiberglass, and in 1968 the company adopted its present name.
  </p>
  <p>
   Vincent Sarni (CEO, 1984-93) recognized that 85% of the company's sales were to the maturing construction and automobile industries. Sarni decided to move the company into growing industries, such as electronics.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1986 PPG spent $154 million on acquisitions, including the medical electronics units of
   <company id="10902">
    Litton Industries
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10062">
    Honeywell
   </company>
   . It acquired the medical technology business of Allegheny International in 1987 and bought Casco Nobel, a coatings distributor, and the Olympic and Lucite paint lines from
   <company id="10354">
    Clorox
   </company>
   in 1989.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company, which owned one-third of Dutch fiberglass producer Silenka BV, acquired the rest in 1991. In 1992 PPG acquired a silica plant in the Netherlands, its first in Europe. Two years later it acquired the European automotive coatings business of Netherlands-based Akzo Nobel.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1990s PPG backed away from Sarni's earlier strategies for greater diversification and unloaded a number of high-tech businesses. The firm refocused on its core coatings, glass, and chemicals operations. PPG acquired Matthews Paints, a leading maker of paints for outdoor signs, and the refinish coating business of Lilly Industries in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bolstered its chemical operations in 1997 with the addition of France's Sipsy Chime Fine. That same year President and COO Raymond LeBoeuf took over as CEO. In 1998 PPG sold its European flat and automotive glass business to Belgium-based Glaverbel. Acquisitions that year included Australia-based Orica's technical coatings unit and the US paint operations (Porter Paints) of Akzo Nobel.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 PPG expanded its European coatings business with the purchase of Belgium-based Sigma Coatings' commercial transport coatings unit and Akzo Nobel's aircraft coatings and sealants company,
   <company id="119655">
    PRC-DeSoto International
   </company>
   . That year PPG also bought
   <company id="41791">
    Imperial Chemical Industries
   </company>
   ' Germany-based coatings business for large commercial vehicles and its US-based auto refinish and industrial coatings businesses. PPG's acquisition spree continued in 2000 with architectural coating maker Monarch Paint.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in the new decade, PPG suffered from flat or declining earnings from existing operations. Amid falling sales and lower prices for chemicals and glass, PPG began to cut jobs and closed some facilities. Still the company recorded its first loss in more than 10 years in 2002 and its second straight year of declining sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Like many manufacturers in its industry, PPG has been exposed to potentially costly asbestos litigation, mainly because of its 50% stake in the bankrupt Pittsburgh Corning, a joint venture with
   <company id="10409">
    Corning
   </company>
   that made insulation with asbestos. In 2002 PPG and its insurers agreed to pay roughly $2.7 billion to settle its asbestos claims.
  </p>
  <p>
   LeBoeuf retired in 2005. He was replaced by president and COO Charles Bunch, who had joined the company in 1979 and worked up through the ranks of, first, the finance department, and then the coatings operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008, PPG acquired
   <company id="132662">
    SigmaKalon
   </company>
   for $3 billion. SigmaKalon was among the top 10 paint manufacturers in the world and did business almost entirely outside the US. The company now operates as PPG's Architectural Coatings segment. That same year, PPG sold its auto glass business to  private equity group
   <company id="131641">
    Kohlberg &amp; Company
   </company>
   , which set the unit up as a stand-alone company called
   <company id="108503">
    Pittsburgh Glass Works
   </company>
   . PPG received $330 million plus a 40% interest in the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011, PPG acquired Equa-Chlor, a producer of chlorine, caustic soda, and muriatic acid, for $27 million. Equa-Chlor produces about 220 tons of chlorine per day. In addition to its products, PPG also bought Equa-Chlor's distribution system, which includes a railcar fleet it integrated into its own. The deal for the Washington state-based company bolsters PPG's chlor-alkali business in the Northwest US, and expands its overall supply chain.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its push to expand in emerging markets, in 2011 PPG formed a joint venture with an India-based company, Harsha Exito Engineering Private, to produce fiber glass reinforcement products.
  </p>
  <p>
   It made two foreign acquisitions to expand its international operations in 2011. First it bought the business assets of Ducol Coatings South Africa Ltd., which had served as an importer and distributor of PPG's automotive refinish products in South Africa since 2003. PPG also expanded its joint venture with India-based Asian Paints (India's largest coatings company) and created a second 50-50 JV in 2012. The deals boosts PPG's position in the Chinese and Asian packaging coatings industry, part of its global strategy to expand into emerging regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2012, the company made four acquisitions related to its coatings business for a total of $288 million, including US-based Spraylat Corp., Denmark based Dyrup A/S, and the coatings business of Ecuador-based Colpisa Colombiana de Pinturas.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding PPG's architectural coatings business in the US, Canada, and the Caribbean, in 2013 it bought Azko Nobel's North American Decorative Paints business for $1.05 billion.
