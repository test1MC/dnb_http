   In response to&#160;the industry-wide decline in business-to-business print advertising,&#160;Advanstar&#160;has beefed up its&#160;multimedia and events management portfolio&#160;to compensate.

        <p>
   In 2013, its Advanstar Global LLC unit acquired ENK International LLC for $155 million. ENK organizes leading fashion events in New York, Las Vegas, Europe and Asia featuring properties such as Fashion Coterie, Intermezzo Collections, Accessories Circuit and ENK Vegas.&#160; Through this acquisition, Advanstar significantly&#160;grew its international fashion event portfolio across multiple segments and markets, adding ENK's brands to its MAGIC, PROJECT, FN Platform, Licensing International, and other tradeshows, conferences, and events.
  </p>
        <p>
   That year the company also launched IVT Network, a Web-based&#160;Advanstar data service for validation professionals that&#160;provides regulatory and industry guidance through peer-reviewed journals, special reports, protocols, training videos, whitepapers, conferences and more.
  </p>
        <p>
   Advanstar has also&#160;been cutting costs in order to deal with the challenging market. In 2010 it cut about 100 jobs that were instead outsourced to

   , with operations mainly in India. That year the company also sold its Off-Road.com and ceased publication of consumer custom sportbike magazine

        <p>
   Advanstar traces its roots to 1939, when Davidson Publishing Co. was formed. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich purchased Davidson and its sister company Ojibway in 1968.&#160;A group of investors purchased Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1987, and in 1992 the company was reorganized and emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy as Advanstar Communication. Before being acquired by Veronis, Advanstar was owned by DLJ Merchant Banking Partners III, the merchant banking affiliate of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette (now part of Credit Suisse Group).
  </p>
        <p>
   The company struggled under the heavy debt incurred as a result of the more than $1 billion acquisition by&#160;Veronis Suhler Stevenson&#160;in 2007.&#160;Advanstar in 2009 completed a restructuring through striking a deal with lenders to eliminate $385 million worth of debt and generate $35 million in new capital investment.
