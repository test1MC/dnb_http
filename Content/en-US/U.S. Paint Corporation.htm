   motorcycles. Additional markets include farm and construction equipment and power sports vehicles like jet skis and ATVs. Previously a unit of Japanese firm Nippon Oil and Fats, U.S. Paint went through a management buy-out in 2004. The company, founded in 1931, then sold its aerospace and marine product units.

   The US paint and coatings industry is forecast to grow 3.9% annually to $1.4 billion gallons in 2019 (valued at $31 billion). Gains will be driven by a strong rebound in construction activity which will stimulate demand in architectural paint, the largest market group.
  </p>
  <p>
   U.S. Paint plans to continue to see strong growth as it develop new products to meet consumer tastes. In addition, new technological advances, such as nanostructured coatings, will expand future growth as they will open new applications by providing antimicrobial, self-cleaning, sound dampening, anticorrosive, and light emitting functions.
