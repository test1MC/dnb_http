   Specialty paper products producer Rockline Industries woke up and smelled the coffee 30 years ago. The company is North America's largest supplier of coffee filters. Rockline also manufactures and distributes baking cups, coffee stir sticks, coffeemaker and urn-cleaner, heat seal filter paper for tea bags and coffee pouches, moist towelettes, and permanent coffee filters. A leading maker of private label baby wipes, too, the company produces water activated and wet facial and incontinent wipes, and household cleaning wipes. Rockline's branded and private label products are sold worldwide. Company president Randy Rudolph and his siblings own the company, founded by their father.

   Rockline does business in more than 50 countries and has manufacturing facilities in Arkansas, New Jersey, and Wisconsin, as well as in the UK (where it is trademarked as "the clean company") and South China to capture the rising demand for antibacterial and disinfectant wipes. One of the company's Arkansas facilities is the largest factory of its kind in the world.
