   You may not be able to pop a wheelie, but Yamaha Motor still offers a cool ride. Best known for its extensive line of motorcycles, the company also makes scooters, electric-hybrid bicycles, four-wheel ATVs, leisure and fishing boats, racing and golf carts, and snowmobiles. Other products include engines, swimming pools, electric wheelchairs, robots, and helicopter drones used to spray agricultural crops. Motorcycles, which make up about 70% of the company's overall sales, have about a 15% market share in the US. Overseas markets account for about 90% of sales. Founded in 1955, Yamaha Motor and its more than 140 subsidiaries and affiliates operate sales and manufacturing plants throughout the world.

   Company Background
  </p>
  <p>
   The origins of Yamaha Motor can be traced back to WWII. During the war Nippon Gakki Co. -- like most Japanese businesses -- retooled to make products for Japan's war effort. Nippon Gakki, which literally means "Japan musical instruments," switched from making pianos and organs to building propellers, fuel tanks, and wing parts for Japanese Zero fighter planes. This experience would later help Nippon Gakki (now called Yamaha Corporation) diversify into other industrial products during the years immediately after the war.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nippon Gakki built its first motorcycle, the 125 cubic centimeter (cc) YA-1, in 1955. Later that year Yamaha Motor was created. Nippon Gakki retained partial ownership of the new company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yamaha Motor built its first sailboat using fiberglass-reinforced plastic in 1960. The company's line of marine products soon expanded to include powerboats, outboard motors, fishing vessels, and patrol boats for Japan's Maritime Safety Agency.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the early 1960s Yamaha Motor (along with
   <company id="41867">
    Honda
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41859">
    Suzuki
   </company>
   ) successfully penetrated the US market with a line of small, inexpensive motorcycles. Prior to the introduction of Japanese imports, the US motorcycle market had been dominated by heavy models built by the likes of
   <company id="10706">
    Harley-Davidson
   </company>
   and
   <company id="93674">
    Triumph
   </company>
   . Yamaha Motor's motorcycles also enjoyed success in Asian markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1966 Yamaha Motor provided the engine for
   <company id="41889">
    Toyota
   </company>
   's 2000GT sports car. By 1968 the company had introduced its first snowmobile (the SL350) and had opened its first overseas subsidiary, Yamaha Motor Europe NV (the Netherlands).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company continued to expand geographically as it established Yamaha Motor do Brasil (1970) and Yamaha Motor Canada (1973). Product lines also grew in 1973 to include racing karts and generators. Yamaha Motor began marketing its first line of golf carts two years later. In 1977 the company created Yamaha Corporation, USA. The following year Yamaha Motor began marketing its first snow blower.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1981 the company had developed industrial assembly robots. Yamaha Motor introduced a four-wheel ATV in 1984. The following year the company entered into a development agreement with
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   for high-performance engines, and by 1986 the company offered personal watercraft. Yamaha Motor entered new markets in 1987 -- gas heat-pump (GHP) air conditioners (exited in 2000) and surface mounters for printed circuit boards.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yamaha Motor started the Zhuzhou Nanfang Yamaha Motor Co. joint venture in China in 1993 for the production of motorcycles. The following year the company established two more joint ventures in China for the production of boats. Continuing to build upon its innovative traditions, Yamaha Motor developed the world's first auxiliary electric power unit for wheelchairs in 1996 and the PAS MH Super electro-hybrid bicycle in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 the company began producing motorcycles in Vietnam. Yamaha Corporation decreased its stake in Yamaha Motor to about 28% in 2000, and Toyota Motor took a 5% stake in the company to become Yamaha Motor's second-largest shareholder. In early 2001 Yamaha Motor announced that it would pursue legal action against the manufacturers of counterfeit motorcycles bearing the Yamaha name made in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year, in anticipation of its 50th anniversary in 2005, Yamaha announced its NEXT 50 mid-term management plan. The three-year plan increased net sales while strengthening Yamaha's position in China, India, and ASEAN (Southeast Asia) countries. In 2005 Yamaha launched a subsidiary in Russia, Yamaha Motor CIS, to sell Yamaha products at more than 80 dealers in that country. The same year it set up a subsidiary to sell motorcycles in India.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the Japanese government filed a criminal complaint accusing Yamaha Motor of exporting unmanned helicopters to China in violation of regulations that forbid the unlicensed export of products that could have a military use.
