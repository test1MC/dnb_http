  <p>
   Dewhurst's revenues dipped by 1% from 2014 to 2015 mainly fueled by a 16% decline in UK revenue across all domestic companies. The companies were affected by reduced infrastructure spending in the UK. However, the company strengthened its overseas market which increased by 10% in its export sales. The two primary areas of growth were Canada and the Middle East.

   One primary area of growth for Dewhurst includes Canada, where it has been able to broaden the range of products the company sells to its sister company, Dupar Controls. The Middle East is its second area of growth. The company also has projects in the UK, Canada, and Dubai for both new builds and modernization.
