   PerkinElmer makes tools to find out what's in you and your environment. It develops and sells equipment that researchers use to identify and treat diseases and to analyze food products as well as air, water, and soil to identify impurities and contaminants. The company, which distributes its offerings in more than 150 countries, generates most of its sales from laboratory products and other offerings. Prenatal and newborn testing and screenings in emerging markets such as Brazil and China have been growth areas for the company. China is PerkinElmer's second biggest market behind the US. PerkinElmer traces its roots to 1931.

  <p>
   The company sells its products in two segments that are further divided into several markets each. The human health segment accounts for more than 60% of sales and environmental health accounts for the rest. About two-thirds of PerkinElmer's sales are from products and the rest is from services in contracts, field service, diagnostic testing, and training.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has manufacturing and assembly plants, research laboratories, administrative offices, and other facilities in about 125 locations in about 15 states and 36 countries. About 40% of sales are to customers in the US. China is the next biggest market with 15% of sales. Another 15% of sales came from four European counties.

  <p>
   Customers include academic and research organizations, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, doctors, government agencies, laboratories, private health care organizations, and public health authorities. The volume of business done with these customers is subject to not only economic conditions, but in the case of government funding, to the political process, which can be fluid and unpredictable. The health care industry, particularly the genetic screening market, is highly regulated.
  </p>
  <p>
   PerkinElmer sells through its direct sales force and through distributors in some areas.

  <p>
   In 2016 (ended January), PerkinElmer's revenue ticked up slightly to $2.26 billion from $2.24 billion in 2015. Revenue from acquisitions helped boost revenue. Product revenue in its environmental health segment increased 6% from year-to-year while product revenue in the human health segment slid 2%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income jumped 35% higher to $212 million in 2016 from 2014 with the greater revenue and lower selling, general, and administrative expenses. The company realized savings from cost containment and productivity initiatives. It also lost less from mark-to-market adjustment for post-retirement benefit plans.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations was $287 million in 2016, up from $281.6 million in 2015.

  <p>
   PerkinElmer realigned parts of its business to more clearly focus on end markets as well as develop products and solutions with more value added. OneSource, the multivendor laboratory service business that serves the life sciences end market, was shifted from the Environmental Health segment to Human Health segment.In 2015, the company took charges of nearly $18 million for restructuring, which included reducing the number of employees.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, PerkinElmer sold its PerkinElmer Labs/NTD US prenatal screening laboratory services business to Eurofins Scientific for an undisclosed price. PerkinElmer said the sale will allow it to focus on developing new maternal fetal health technologies the the US market, while continuing to provide kits, technologies, and services outside the US.

  <p>
   In 2015 (ended January), the company acquired five businesses a total of $77.1 million, in cash. The spree included the purchase of Vanadis Diagnostics, AB, which should build on PerkinElmer's maternal fetal health offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, it paid about $270 million for Perten Instruments Group, a provider of analytical instruments and services for quality control of food, grain, flour, and feed. The Perten products should extend PerkinElmer's reach in the academic and industrial end markets.

  <p>
   PerkinElmer also picked up Ceiba Solutions, a sciences and laboratory IT software and services company. Ceiba's products have been integrated into the OneSource services

  <p>
   PerkinElmer traces its roots back to the invention of the strobe light in 1931.
   <company id="40300">
    MIT
   </company>
   professor Harold Edgerton, who invented the strobe light while doing research on electric motors, formed a consulting business with former student Kenneth Germeshausen that used strobe lights and high-speed photography to solve manufacturing problems. As business picked up, they brought in another former student, Herbert Grier, and in 1947 formed Edgerton, Germeshausen and Grier. Their first contract job was to photograph nuclear weapons tests for the US government. The company went public in 1959 and changed its name to EG&amp;G in 1966.
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the next 30 years, EG&amp;G bought scores of companies involved in electronic instruments and components, biomedical services, energy and nuclear weapons R&amp;D, seal and gasket manufacturing, automotive testing, and the aerospace industry. Key acquisitions included Reynolds Electrical &amp; Engineering (1967), which provided support services for the
