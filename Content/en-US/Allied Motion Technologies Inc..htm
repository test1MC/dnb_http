  <p>
   Allied Motion enjoyed unprecedented growth for the year as revenues jumped 23% from $102 million in 2012 to a record-high of $126 million in 2013. The growth for 2013 was due to the acquisition of Globe in addition to increases in its vehicle and aerospace and defense markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, its profits have been falling over the last three years, with earnings declining from $7 million in 2011 to $4 million in 2013. The erosion of profits was due to expenses incurred as a result of acquisitions which included a rise in business development and interest expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Allied Motion's cash flow from operations steadily grew from $2.8 million in 2009 to $8.9 million in 2011. After decreasing to $4.6 million in 2012, cash flow shot up again to almost $11 million in 2013 due to changes in working capital.

   for about $90 million. Globe Motors is stationed in Dayton, Ohio, with additional operations in Dothan, Alabama; Reynosa, Mexico; and Oporto, Portugal. The deal expanded its global reach and fortified its sales, marketing, and manufacturing capabilities.
