   Huhtamaki creates the perfect teacup for your tempest. The company makes dinnerware under the Chinet brand name to consumers, as well as an array of disposable foodservice products used by caterers to takeouts. Its offerings include plastic and paperboard cups and containers, and molded fiber trays, plates, and bowls, in various shapes and sizes. Instead of virgin wood fiber, the company's molded-fiber lines use either post-industrial or post-consumer recycled fiber, which are compostable, too. Huhtamaki's plants dot the US. Established through the acquisition of

   On its own, Huhtamaki's research and develop efforts have produced a range of new products that feed the market's appetite for convenience. Its launches include a cup carrier coupled with a condiment or food tray, a food container sealed with a cap holding utensils to eat the contents, and a package-forming machine that enables dairy processors to efficiently change packaging sizes and shapes.

   Acquisitions continue Huhtamaki's growth strategy in the US and allow it to build a stronger position in the North American restaurant and foodservice markets. In 2012 it acquired the Winterfield Company, a manufacturer of paper tableware catering to the US. The acquired business was consolidated into the North America segment.

  <p>
   In another move to expand, Huhtamaki opened a new 940,000 sq. ft. facility in Batavia, Ohio, in 2013. The few facility extended the company's warehousing and distribution capabilities for managing the growing supply chain of its foodservice products.
