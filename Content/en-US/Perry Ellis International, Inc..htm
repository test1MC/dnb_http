   , and

  <p>
   Perry Ellis International rings up 10% of its sales outside the US. PEI's apparel is made by Asian and Central American contractors and is sold in the US, Canada, Mexico, the UK, and elsewhere in Europe.

  <p>
   PEI is a diversified company with a vast portfolio of brands and products, which it peddles through multiple distribution channels (from mass merchants to luxury stores and specialty shops). The company generates most of its revenue from wholesale sales, which represented 97% of its business in fiscal 2014 (ends January). Of this segment, some 73% came from the sale of men's sportswear; women's sportswear accounted for 15%. PEI is looking to boost business in its direct-to-consumer channel (9% of sales), which includes retail stores and e-commerce revenue, for all of its brands worldwide. Its retail stores operation includes 42 Perry Ellis, six Original Penguin, and two multibrand retail outlet stores located primarily in upscale retail outlet malls across the US, Puerto Rico, and the UK, as well as two Perry Ellis, two Cubavera, and 19 Original Penguin full-price retail stores located in upscale demographic markets in the US and UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   Licensing agreements accounted for a mere 3% of PEI's revenue. Looking to make itself a mainstay in the apparel arena, PEI licenses its name to third parties -- a strategy many fashion houses have moved away from. Despite this, the company continues to license its name, citing that the effort elevates the overall awareness of its brands without much investment.

   The apparel maker's sales have fallen from their peak of $980 million reached in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2014 (ended January) net sales declined 6%, to $912.2 million, versus the prior year. With the exception of licensing (up 9% year over year), all of PEI's business segments posted declines, with its largest, Men's Sportwear and Swim, down 6%. The company blamed the decline in sales in its core segment on decreases in its mid-tier channel, with private and exclusive brands down more than 20% as PEI exited lower margin programs, and as the channel experienced more softness and retailers worked aggressively to manage inventory. These factors were partially offset by increases of 13% in golf apparel sales, including sales of Callaway, PGA Tour, and Ben Hogan. Nike swimwear sales also rose.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company posted a loss of $22.8 million in fiscal 2014 versus a profit of $14.8 million the prior year. Increased operating expenses, including impairment on assets expenses, and higher selling, general, and administrative expenses, coupled with lower sales contributed to the loss. Cash flow from operations shrunk to $200,000, a decrease of $76.8 million versus 2013, on a decrease in accounts receivable, among other factors.

  <p>
   PEI employs a three-dimensional approach to growth and profitability by developing and enhancing its portfolio of brands, increasing its product offering, and broadening distribution for its brands. Already a major player in menswear, PEI has been actively building its women's contemporary brands business with a spate of acquisitions in recent years. Women's brands acquired in the last few years include Rafaella (2011), and Laundry by Shelli Segal and C&amp;C California acquired from Liz Claiborne in 2008. Laundry is a key dress brand for major retailers such as
   <company id="14487">
    Saks
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="105266">
    Bloomingdale's
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="14261">
    Nordstrom
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="11064">
    Neiman Marcus
   </company>
   , while C&amp;C is a contemporary brand for missies and juniors.
  </p>
  <p>
   With sales of golf apparel a relative bright spot amid declining sales, PEI recently signed a long-term licensing agreement with Nicklaus International Brand Management to design, manufacture, and distribute men's and ladies' sportswear, tailored clothing, and accessories under the Jack Nicklaus and Golden Bear brands in the US, Canada, and Mexico.
  </p>
  <p>
   The apparel company has sought to further diversify by seeking out new markets overseas. Adding the huge Chinese market to the list, in 2012 PEI formed a joint venture with China Outfitters Holdings (CHO), to develop its Manhattan brand in China, Hong Kong, and Macau. CHO will make and distribute Manhattan-brand apparel through in-store shops in more than 160 better department stores throughout China by 2017. Also, PEI hopes to learn about opportunities for its other brands in the Chinese market through the joint venture. Previously, PEI inked a licensing deal with South Pacific Apparel, which makes and markets Savane- and Farah-branded pants and shorts for men and boys in Australia, New Zealand, and elsewhere in the South Pacific region. Also, it has added several licensing deals to sell clothes in South Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.

  <p>
   In early 2012 PEI paid $7 million to acquire the worldwide intellectual property rights to the Ben Hogan family of brands from
   <company id="15521">
    Callaway Golf
   </company>
   . The purchase bolstered the company's golf apparel business and expanded its operations in South Korea and Japan, where it assumed licensing agreements for the Ben Hogan brand. To build its women's business, PEI acquired the privately-held Rafaella Apparel Group from affiliates of
   <company id="112328">
    Cerberus Capital Management
   </company>
   for $80 million in early 2011.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   George Feldenkreis, a Cuban lawyer of Ukrainian descent, came to the US in 1961 and began Carfel, a distributor of Japanese auto parts. He started Supreme International in 1967 as an importer of guayabera shirts -- those pleated, four-pocket shirts favored by Hispanic men. During the next decade the company expanded into sport shirts and designing its own products. Feldenkreis' fashion-savvy son, Oscar, joined Supreme in 1980. Gradually the company began making products for more upscale retailers and in 1989 launched the Natural Issue line.
  </p>
  <p>
   Supreme went public in 1993, paving the way for acquisitions and further expansion. The purchase that year of big-and-tall apparel maker Alexander Martin gave Supreme its first US factory. In 1995 the company licensed Isaco International, owned by Oscar's father-in-law, to make Natural Issue underwear and sleepwear. It paid $18 million the next year for rights to the Munsingwear label, related brand names, and the well-known penguin logo. The company bought sweater maker Crossings in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   In April 1999 Supreme paid $75 million for Perry Ellis International, which fashion designer Perry Ellis had formed in 1978 to handle the licensing of his name. Ellis died in 1986, shortly before the peak of the Perry Ellis womenswear business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Along with the Perry Ellis trademarks, Supreme took the Perry Ellis International name. Also in 1999 the company added labels John Henry, Manhattan, and Lady Manhattan, purchasing the trademarks from bankrupt Perry Ellis licensee Salant. That year it also obtained apparel licenses for PING-brand golf clothing, Andrew Fezza dress sportswear, and PNB Nation young men's urban apparel.
  </p>
  <p>
   The new PEI began working to reinvigorate the faded but well-known Perry Ellis label through dozens of new licensing arrangements, including Kellwood's early 2000 launch of a new Perry Ellis womenswear line (discontinued 2001). The company signed an agreement in late 2000 giving Alpha Shirt Company the rights to distribute Perry Ellis menswear to advertising specialty and promotional products companies. It also purchased the Mondo di Marco, MDM by Mondo (both licensed by Grupo Versatex, a Mexican clothing manufacturer), Pronto Uomo, and Linea Uomo brands from bankrupt Mondo.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 PEI agreed to acquire certain assets of Bugle Boy Industries, a manufacturer of menswear and boy's clothing, to better compete in the young men's clothing market. The company purchased the Jantzen brand and licensed the Tommy Hilfiger (women's swimwear only) brand in 2002 from V.F. to extend into the women's and swimwear markets. In 2002 Perry Ellis also became the US licensee for NIKE's line of women's and girls' swimsuits, men's and boys' racing swimsuits, swim equipment, and swim accessories. In 2006 Perry Ellis extended its license for Nike Swim through 2009. The agreement includes men's, women's, and children's swimwear, as well as related performance and casual products, apparel, and equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2002 Perry Ellis subsidiary Jantzen, the well-known swimwear maker, entered into a licensing agreement with Trop-Tracks L.L.C. for the manufacturing and distribution of a footwear collection under the Jantzen trademark, thus starting the expansion of Jantzen beyond swimsuits and into leisurewear.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 the company bought out its largest manufacturing licensee,
   <company id="11314">
    Salant
   </company>
   , to gain tighter control of its name and greater market share in the menswear arena. That year it also acquired the high-end actions sports brand Redsand. PEI also entered in 2003 into a licensing agreement with the Randa Corp. to manufacture and distribute John Henry brand neckwear. And it made a licensing agreement with
   <company id="11133">
    Oxford Industries
   </company>
   to create and sell a line of men's tailored clothing aimed at the Hispanic market. Brand names include Cubavera and Havanera. It also entered into a licensing agreement with Utex for the production of women's coats, rainwear, and outerwear. Utex also distributes Perry Ellis men's tailored clothing and outerwear in Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wanting to expand its brand portfolio and increase its wholesale revenue, PEI in 2005 purchased ailing clothing manufacturer
   <company id="54321">
    Tropical Sportswear International
   </company>
   for about $88.5 million in cash. The deal brought the Banana Joe, Farah, and Savane names. In 2006 the company partnered with
   <company id="40278">
    Levi Strauss &amp; Co.
   </company>
   to make and distribute Dockers-brand outerwear (including men's jackets, fleece items, and coats) in the US and Mexico through December 2009.
  </p>
  <p>
   PEI signed a licensing deal in mid-2007 with ACI International to design, make, and distribute footwear under the Original Penguin brand. It entered a licensing agreement in May 2008 with Smart Apparel US to design, make, and distribute Perry Ellis- and Perry Ellis Portfolio-branded tailored clothing, including men's suits, suit separates, and sports jackets in the US. The company entered several licensing agreements that August with
   <company id="132357">
    Randa Accessories
   </company>
   and its luggage division to make neckwear and luggage in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Building its stable of brands, PEI acquired the Laundry By Design and C&amp;C California brands from
   <company id="13977">
    Liz Claiborne
   </company>
   for about $37 million in February 2008. In March 2009, PEI penned licensing agreement with
   <company id="15521">
    Callaway Golf
   </company>
   to design, manufacture, and distribute Callaway golf and sportswear apparel in the US.
