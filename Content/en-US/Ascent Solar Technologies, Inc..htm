   As long as that sun keeps ascending in the eastern skies every day, there will be ventures trying to tap its enormous energy resources. Ascent Solar Technologies is a development-stage company working on photovoltaic modules for use in consumer applications as well as satellites and spacecraft. The firm aspires to make such gear smaller, lighter, and more flexible than existing solar cells for use in space by utilizing a thin-film absorbing layer on top of a polyimide substrate. The thin-film layer on top of the high-temperature plastic is made up of copper, indium, gallium, and selenium, which is why the technology is called CIGS.

   Ascent Solar grew out of ITN Energy Systems, a technology incubator firm involved in several areas of energy research and development. ITN Energy Systems spun off Ascent Solar in 2005 to commercialize its CIGS photovoltaic (PV) module technology; it owns almost 6% of Ascent Solar. ITN Energy Systems in turn is owned by Inica, Inc., and Ascent Solar's Chairman Mohan Misra is the majority shareholder of Inica. Ascent Solar completed a $16.5 million IPO in 2006.

   The company announced the appointment of Dr. Farhad Moghadam as the company's president and CEO, effective August 2009. Moghadam takes over from chairman Mohan Misra, the company's founder. Misra has served as interim president since September 2008; he owns 5% of Ascent Solar Technologies, including stock options. Misra retired at the end of 2010.
