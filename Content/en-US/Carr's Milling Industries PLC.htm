   Carr's Group plc formerly (Carr's Milling Industries) will assist you in making bread, feeding the livestock, repairing the delivery truck, heating the old homestead...and building a nuclear reactor. The UK company's two divisions are agriculture (farm products and services, including livestock feed); and engineering (steel fabrication, manipulators, and robotics). Carr's agricultural division also supplies fuel (oil, gas, diesel) for farm customers, and operates a network of retail stores under the Country Store banner. The company sold its Feed business to Whitworths Holdings Limited in 2016. Carr's Group was founded by Jonathan Dodgson Carr in 1831.

  <p>
   Carr's Agriculture division, which accounts for around 90% of revenue, develops and sells animal nutrition products for the livestock industry. Products include Crystalyx, SmartLic, and Megastart. It also supplies British farms and rural communities through a retail network. Its feed supplements are molasses-based high and low moisture feed blocks.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Engineering segment designs and produces equipment including manipulators, robotics, specialist fabrication, and precision machining. Products, such as Telbot and the A1000 robots, include pressure vessels and steel fabrications, remote handling technology, robotics, and radiation protection equipment for use in hostile environments.

  <p>
   Carr's manufactures products in the UK, Germany, and the US. It makes some 85% of revenue from the UK market.

  <p>
   Carr's distribution network spans the UK, Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, South America, and North America. Its customer base comprises the dairy, beef, sheep, pig, and equine sectors (agriculture); and nuclear research, oil and gas, and petrochem sectors (engineering).

  <p>
   In fiscal 2016, revenue fell 23% to £314.9 million after it sold off its Feed business. Revenue from the Agriculture segment was down 4% to £284.8 million, while the Engineering segment also fell, by 10%, to £30.1 million. UK Agriculture experienced mixed fortunes amid low farmer confidence, with growth of 16% in retail sales offset by 8% and 15% declines in machinery and tractor sales, respectively. Carr's made progress in increasing the weight of nuclear in its Engineering sales mix (from 62% to 69%), but delays in the award of contracts blunted revenue. The completion of the large BP contract in 2015 also impacted on segment revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income was up 2% to £14.0 million on the back of a 9% increase in Agriculture profit to £10.3 million, partially offset by a 5% fall in Engineering profit to £2.5 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's cash position strengthened by 1% to £10.1 million due to a large tax payment in the previous year.

  <p>
   Carr's Group sold off its food division in 2016 to Whitworths Holdings for £36 million. The sale was conducted to strengthen the company's balance sheet and allow for a greater focus on agriculture and its international feed supplement division.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has been investing in production and R&amp;D facilities in the UK and abroad. It expanded its Country Store network into new territories organically and through acquisitions, including new or redeveloped stores in Wigton, Leek, and Penicuik. In the US, where the cattle market is recovering and delivery strong results for Carr's, the company has invested in a block plant in Silver Springs. It brought two new products -- Megastart and Piglyx -- to market, and moved into the New Zealand and South American markets as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carr's expects demographic and industry trends to be beneficial in the long term. An ever-growing world population will drive demand for smarter agriculture, and new nuclear projects in the UK, such as those linked to the Sellafield nuclear power station in the short term and the early-stage Hinkley Point construction in the longer term, will open up opportunities.

  <p>
   Carr's makes occasional small acquisitions, including the £1.7 million buyout of Phoenix Feeds in 2016, and the £0.3 million acquisition of Green (Agriculture) Co in 2015.
