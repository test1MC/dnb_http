   RiceBran Technologies (formerly NutraCea) hopes that one person's trash really can be another person's treasure. The company uses one of the world's largest wasted food resources, rice bran -- a rice by-product containing oil, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, fibers, and antioxidants -- to make and enhance the nutritional value of consumer products such as dietary and food supplements and animal feed. Its products are used by food manufacturers, nutraceutical makers, and petfood and feed manufacturers. Following a strategic change in focus from a multidivisional company to one focused solely on rice bran bio-refining, the company in 2012 changed its name to RiceBran Technologies.

  <p>
   Incorporated in 1998 as Alliance Consumer International, NutraCea gained the RiceX and RiceX Solubles brands through its acquisition of
   <company id="117714">
    The RiceX Company
   </company>
   in 2005. In 2008 the company acquired Irgovel, a plant in Pelotas, Brazil for processing  rice bran oil.
  </p>
  <p>
   NutraCea began to face troubles in early 2009 and announced it would be restating its financial statements for the previous two years due to an audit that revealed, among other things, that the 2007 sale of its Dr. Vetz PetFlex product line was never paid for in full. Shortly thereafter, NutraCea CEO Brad Edson stepped down. The company restructured its business by exiting non-core lines. It sold its Vital Living assets to Ceautamed Worldwide mid-year. Then it sold its interest in PT Panganmas Inti Nusantara (which had been to facilitate the construction and operation of a wheat flour mill in Indonesia) and shuttered two manufacturing facilities in Louisiana. The company shifted production from those plants to its facilities in California.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2009 and continued with its restructuring measures. In 2010 it cut its workforce by nearly 20% and sold its infant cereal ingredients business, including manufacturing equipment from its Phoenix plant, to
   <company id="91314">
    Kerry Group
   </company>
   for $3.9 million plus inventory costs. The company went on to shed its Max "E" Glo, NutraGlo, and Satin Finish brands to Manna Pro Products for roughly $750,000. All of the products sold to Manna Pro continue to be co-branded with NutraCea's logo.
  </p>
  <p>
   It went on to sell property in Phoenix belonging to its wholly owned subsidiary NutraPhoenix to David Turner International for about $4.5 million. The Phoenix facility was the last major asset related to the infant cereal business sold to Kerry Ingredients earlier in 2010, with proceeds from the sale allowing the firm to fully repay its bank debt and emerge from bankruptcy.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2011 the
   <company id="56705">
    US Securities and Exchange Commission
   </company>
   charged Nutracea and five former employees with fraudulent accounting. According to the SEC, the company recorded false sales and engaged in "improper revenue recognition practices" in its 2007 annual report and financial statements for the second and third quarters of that year. The SEC claims NutraCea recorded $2.6 million in false sales to Bi-Coastal Pharmaceutical, resulting in sales being inflated by some 35%. The company and the SEC later settled the charges with no financial penalties and without admitting or denying the charges.
  </p>
  <p>
   In October 2012 the company changed its name to RiceBran Technologies to reflect its decision to focus on its rice bran bio-refining business.
