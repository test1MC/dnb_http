   American Homestar shines brightly in the manufactured housing industry. The company produces factory-built modular, multi-section and single-section manufactured homes, and commercial structures under the Oak Creek and Platinum brand names. Its homes, which typically range from about 1,200 to 2,600 sq. ft., have average prices comparable to site-built homes. Its multi-section homes have as many as six bedrooms. American Homestar sells its homes through company-owned home centers and  franchised retail centers in the South and the Southeast. Other operations include insurance and mortgage financing services.

  <p>
   Finis Teeter had been selling manufactured homes since he was 17 before founding Mobile America Housing Corp. in 1971. A manufactured-home retailer, the company was incorporated as American Homestar in 1983. It rose out of the collapse of the Texas manufactured-home market in the late 1980s, during which the number of manufacturers dwindled from about 60 in 1984 to six in the early 1990s.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 American Homestar moved toward becoming a vertically integrated company, setting up its own transportation company (Roadmasters Transport) and forming a joint venture with manufacturer Oak Creek Homes, run by Laurence Dawson. American Homestar opened two more plants and acquired Oak Creek Homes in 1993. It went public the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   With a strategy for growth that included acquiring other regional manufacturers and setting up its own retail sales centers, American Homestar began a buying spree in the mid-1990s. The company gobbled up Manu-Fac Homes, Heartland Homes (North Carolina), and Guerdon Homes (Idaho, Mississippi, Nebraska, and Oregon) in 1996; Brilliant Holding (Alabama) and N.C. Mobile Home Corporation (North Carolina) the next year; and Davis Homes (Alabama), First Value Homes (North Carolina), and DWP (Oregon, Washington, and New Mexico) in 1998. The buying continued into 1999 with R-Anell Custom Homes and a 25% stake in Zaring National's HomeMax (both based in North Carolina).
  </p>
  <p>
   Due to a downturn in the manufactured home sector, American Homestar closed four of its plants in 2000. The company filed for bankruptcy in early 2001. The court approved its reorganization plan later that year. In 2002 the company had significantly downsized its operations to focus on its core market -- Texas and its surrounding states. To address what it views as an emerging market, the company has aligned itself with several subdivision developments within its region of operation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 American Homestar began producing IHB-code (Industrialized Housing and Building-code) modular homes in its core market; IHB homes generally have fewer zoning restrictions than HUD homes. The company also partnered with a land development company to be an exclusive supplier of homes for a new manufactured housing subdivision, where homes are rented and sold.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year American Homestar sold its 51% interest in Roadmasters Transport Company, Inc., to Roadmasters for approximately $1.4 million. It also dissolved its Homestar 21, LLC financing joint venture with 21st Mortgage Corporation and formed a new 50/50 venture - American Homestar Mortgage, L.L.P. (Homestar Mortgage) - that is jointly owned by American Homestar and by Community Home Loan LLC.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company acquired full ownership of 114 Starwood Development, LTD, a manufactured housing rental community in Houston; it had initially held a 49.5% interest in the venture in 2004. It also established American Homestar Mortgage III, a 50%-owned mortgage brokerage venture with AMCAP Mortgage.
  </p>
  <p>
   Two years later, American Homestar acquired 65% of Alabama-based Platinum Homes (bringing its ownership to 90%). The acquisition boosted its business in several states including Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida.
