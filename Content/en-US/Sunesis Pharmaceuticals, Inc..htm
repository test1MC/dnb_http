   Sunesis builds drugs in miniature first before it builds them in full scale. The biotech firm's method involves building small drug fragments then examining their protein-binding ability and potential for development. Once a fragment shows potential, Sunesis then builds a larger therapeutic compound based upon its model. Its drug candidates target various forms of cancer. Its lead candidate Vosaroxin (SNS-595) is in clinical trials to evaluate its effect on ovarian cancer and acute myeloid leukemia. Other candidates are being studied for treatment of solid tumors and other forms of cancer, both independently and through partnerships. Milestone payments from those partnerships are Sunesis' only revenue to date.

   In addition to developing its own candidates, Sunesis has collaborations with companies including
   <company id="51240">
    Millenium Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   and
   <company id="13209">
    Biogen Idec
   </company>
   to discover new small molecules for potential drug candidates. Other earlier collaborations with
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Myers Squibb
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="11326">
    Merck
   </company>
   have wrapped up, and the company is now more focused on its own candidates.

   In 2013 revenue dropped 25% as it received fewer licensing payments. Sunesis' net loss continued to expand as it continued to spend on R&amp;D, clinical trial expenses, and consulting services.

   In addition to continuing efforts to commercialize Vosaroxin, the company plans to seek additional licensing deals. In 2014 it signed agreements with Biogen Idec and Millennium giving it the rights to develop and commercialize several kinase inhibitors used to treat blood cancers.
