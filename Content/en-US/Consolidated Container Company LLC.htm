   Sometimes rigid is good. Consolidated Container Company (CCC) is one of the largest manufacturers of rigid plastic packaging in the US. The company markets a myriad of containers (used for milk, water, fertilizer, salsa, antifreeze, and more) to industries from dairy to water, agricultural, food, and industrial chemical. Custom packaging, project management, lab work, product integration, and logistics support are part of CCC's service lineup. Privately owned CCC operates some 55 blow-molded manufacturing plants in North America, which produce about 7 billion pieces annually.

  <p>
   CCC utilizes a strategy of mergers and divestitures to grow its business and tighten its focus. In 2013 CCC sold its polycarbonate bottle manufacturing business in Mexico which included two manufacturing plants. The transaction allowed CCC to focus on serving customers in its core rigid plastics business in the US.

   In 2013 it purchased Indiana-based Madras Packaging, a custom bottle manufacturer. It also picked up Shelburne Plastics and its operating businesses: Plastic Technologies of Vermont, Plastic Technologies of Maryland, and Plastic Technologies of New York. In addition, Roffe Container was previously purchased in 2012.
