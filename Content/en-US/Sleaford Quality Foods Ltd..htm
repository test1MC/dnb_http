   Sleaford's Quality Foods is stable. Very
   <em>
    shelf
   </em>
   stable, that is, as no refrigeration is needed to keep its foods fresh. The firm has been supplying dehydrated fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices to foodservice operators and food makers throughout the UK for more than 30 years. Sleaford's 1,200-plus products also include canned fruits, vegetables, fish and meats, as well as a variety of ingredients and dried blended products such as bouillon and pie fillings. James Arnold and Jeremy Weatherall bought Sleaford in 2004 from Mr. Arnold's parents, who founded the company in 1968. Jain Irrigation Systems, which boasts a processed foods unit, owns Sleaford.
