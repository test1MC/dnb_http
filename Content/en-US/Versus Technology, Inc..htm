   No more hospital hide and seek. Versus Technology makes it easier to track down staff and patients in bustling health care environments with its real-time location systems (RTLS) -- made up of hardware, software, and infrared and radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies. The systems can be integrated within an existing IT infrastructure to pinpoint the moving locations of people, equipment, and charts. They are also used to control access, record and report events, and permit communication. Its badges and tags are worn by emergency room, nursing, and security staff and can be attached to mobile medical equipment. Founded in 1988, Versus was acquired by medical equipment maker
   <company id="122349">
    Midmark
   </company>
   in 2016.

  <p>
   The acquisition of Versus Technology boosts Midmark's position in clinical workflows. Midmark's existing Midmark Clinical Solutions (MCS) tool helps health systems improve workflows and patient experiences; the addition of Versus' RTLS technology will improve the MCS offering.
