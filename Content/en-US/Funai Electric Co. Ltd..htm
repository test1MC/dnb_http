   The company's fiscal 2013 (ended March) sales topped $2 billion. a 22% decline versus the prior year. Indeed, Funai has posted sales declines in each of the past three years, with sales down 39% since fiscal 2010. On a regional basis, Funai's sales fell in Japan and the rest of Asia, and in Europe (a tiny market for the company), partially offset by an increase in sales in North America. Strong sales of attractively-priced LCD TVs and sales of Philips-brand audio and accessory products (beginning in September 2012), contributed to sales growth in the North American market. Adverse economic conditions in Japan, Funai's largest market, and the transition to digital terrestrial broadcasting there depressed demand for LCD TVs and Blu-ray products.

  <p>
   Also, the company has been unprofitable in six of the past seven years, posting a net loss of $90.9 million in fiscal 2013. Fierce competition and falling TV prices have hurt the company's bottom line.
