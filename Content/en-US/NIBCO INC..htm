   A more-than-a-century-old manufacturer and distributor of plumbing supplies, NIBCO makes a living by (in its own words) staying ahead of the flow. Its flow-control products include pipes, fittings, actuators, and valves, made from bronze, copper, stainless steel, plastic, and other materials. NIBCO DURA-PEX piping systems, Chemtrol flow-control fittings, radiant heating equipment, and press-to-connect fittings and ball valves, are used in commercial construction, irrigation, residential, environmental, as well as industrial applications around the world.

  <p>
   The company's storied business, however, faces tough competition from Chinese and other low-cost producers. NIBCO preserves its market share by pushing to increase productivity and improve customer service. NIBCO's focus includes new products launches, such as a Universal Sway Brace Attachment (a drill- and weld-free connection); the Fast Clamp attachment (TOLCO seismic bracing line); BlazeMaster fire sprinkler fittings; NIBCO cast bronze Y-strainers, and lead-free products to keep up with new lead-free legislation.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has Web-enabled its offerings via a 3D CAD digital parts catalog. The capability reduces its customers' design time and costs, increasing NIBCO's sales opportunities. NIBCO has long used computer networks to improve its efficiency in handling orders for customers and suppliers; almost all orders are digitally automated.

   In 2016 NIBCO launched its new Press System lead-free brass ball valves. The NIBCO Press System ball valve body features lead-free brass alloy and is dezincification resistant.

  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company acquired the resources of the Sure Seal product line from OPW Engineered Systems, Inc. The assets related to OPW's Transportation valve line will remain with OPW. The acquisition complements and enhances the NIBCO commercial and industrial valve portfolio with patented engineered technology that meets high industry standards.

  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company redesigned its customer-centric website (NIBCO.com) to offer customers easy and quick access to NIBCO's expansive offering of valves, fittings, PEX, and industrial plastics.
  </p>
  <p>
   NIBCO traces its historical roots to 1904.
