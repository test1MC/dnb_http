   What's on Georgia-Pacific's mind? A whole lotta different products, that's what. Georgia-Pacific (GP) is one of the leading tissue products producers and the force behind such household items as Brawny paper towels and Quilted Northern bath tissues. It also makes a wide variety of other products including cardboard packaging, plywood and lumber, related chemicals, fertilizers, recycled paper fibers, Dixie-brand paper cups, touchless towel dispensers, and office paper. GP is one of the largest US forest products manufacturers (with rival

   ). A subsidiary of
   <company id="40267">
    Koch Industries
   </company>
   , GP has around 300 facilities across the US. It was founded as a hardwood lumber wholesaler in 1927 by Owen Cheatham.

   The company has more than 300 facilities across the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   GP is one of the few wood product producers that doesn't own its own timberland. It sources its wood and fiber supply from land owned by private, institutional, industrial, and public entities.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates the GP Harmon Recycling subsidiary, a recycler of paper, metal, and plastics. GP annually uses about 3.4 million tons of recovered paper in its products.

   In 2014 the company announced plans expand its Madison, Georgia, and Gurdon, Arkansas, building products operations. Investments in Madison are expected to be $65 million (for improving production capacity) an an additional $20 million to further modernize the plant. In Gurdon, GP plans to invest $37 million to expand the lumber mill's production capacity.

   GP has put a large amount of effort into acquisitions over the years. In April 2013 GP acquired
   <company id="47096">
    Buckeye Technologies
   </company>
   , a leading manufacturer and marketer of specialty fibers and nonwoven materials made from wood and cotton. The deal, valued at approximately $1.5 billion, was the largest for GP since it was acquired by Koch Industries in 2005. The company was interested in the deal for Buckeye's employees, innovation capabilities, advanced technologies, and specialty fibers and nonwovens businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2013, the company acquired the

  <p>
   Owen Cheatham founded lumber wholesaler Georgia Hardwood Lumber Company in Augusta, Georgia, in 1927. By 1938 the company was operating five southern sawmills, and during WWII it became the largest lumber supplier to the US Armed Forces.
  </p>
  <p>
   Recognizing the potential of plywood, Cheatham bought several plywood mills in the late 1940s, including one in Bellingham, Washington (idled in 2000 because of high energy costs). He began a land-buying spree in 1951 that gave Georgia Hardwood its first timberlands. The company moved its headquarters to Oregon three years later, and in 1957 it adopted the name Georgia-Pacific. By 1960 it had a million acres of timberland.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1960s Georgia-Pacific bought several competitors and diversified into containers, paperboard, tissue, and other products. The Federal Trade Commission forced the company to sell 20% of its assets in 1972. The following year Georgia-Pacific bought
   <company id="10222">
    Boise Cascade's
   </company>
   wood products operations, and in 1975 it acquired Exchange Oil and Gas.
  </p>
  <p>
   Georgia-Pacific continued to diversify into chemicals in 1976 and introduced cheaper plywood substitutes, such as waferboard. It acquired southern timberland and modernized existing paper mills. In 1979 Georgia-Pacific bought Hudson Pulp and Paper and reached $5 billion in sales. The company returned to Georgia in 1982. Two years later Georgia-Pacific decided to sell most of its chemical operations unrelated to forest products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1988 Georgia-Pacific bought Brunswick Pulp and Paper in Georgia, increasing its southern timber holdings. It purchased Great Northern Nekoosa (pulp and paper) in 1990 (later sold to
   <company id="10229">
    Bowater
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   Georgia-Pacific sold its envelope-making business to the Sterling Group in 1994; it also sold its roofing manufacturing line. In 1995 the pulp and paper industry rebounded from several sluggish years, allowing for price increases and higher profit yields. The trend was short-lived, however.
  </p>
  <p>
   Georgia-Pacific more than doubled its gypsum production capacity in 1996 by purchasing nine wallboard plants from
   <company id="51105">
    Domtar
   </company>
   (construction materials). The following year Georgia-Pacific Corporation created separate stocks for its timber and building products businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Georgia-Pacific purchased CeCorr (corrugated sheets). The company paid $1.2 billion in 1999 for North America's #1 paper distributor,
   <company id="52849">
    Unisource Worldwide
   </company>
   , trumping a previous agreement that Unisource had with propane distributor
   <company id="11522">
    UGI
   </company>
   . Also in 1999, Georgia-Pacific and Chesapeake combined their tissue-making businesses into the Georgia-Pacific Tissue joint venture (95% owned by Georgia-Pacific).
  </p>
  <p>
   GP acquired Fort James Corp. for $7.7 billion in 2000, but only after Georgia-Pacific agreed to sell its commercial tissue unit to satisfy regulators. Fort James (Brawny, Mardi Gras, Quilted Northern, and Dixie brands) gave GP about 40% of the North American tissue market. Days after it revealed the deal, Georgia-Pacific announced that it was selling The Timber Company to
   <company id="11196">
    Plum Creek Timber
   </company>
   in a deal worth around $4 billion, signalling its exit from timberland holdings. Also in 2000 Georgia-Pacific and other commercial tissue makers, including
   <company id="10856">
    Kimberly-Clark
   </company>
   and Fort James, agreed to pay $56.2 million to settle allegations of price-fixing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Fort James acquisition, and GP's belief that investors were undervaluing its stock, made it investigate spinning off its consumer products division. Further, a spinoff could have sheltered the consumer operations from exposure to asbestos litigation related to GP's ongoing building operations. Market conditions proved to disfavor initial public offerings, however, and the plan was suspended indefinitely.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Georgia-Pacific sold its commercial tissue unit (to
   <company id="47886">
    Svenska Cellulosa
   </company>
   ) and four of its US pulp and paper mills (to Domtar for $1.65 billion). It also closed three gypsum plants as part of a decision to cut gypsum wallboard production in North America by 45%.
  </p>
  <p>
   GP sold a controlling 60% interest in its Unisource segment to
   <company id="42844">
    Bain Capital
   </company>
   in 2002. The company also announced that it was spinning off its consumer products and packaging operations as CP&amp;P, but withdrew its offer in 2003 due to factors including financial and capital market conditions and asbestos liabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 GP was faced with rising corporate debt and sold assets to raise funds. It sold stand-alone pulp mills in Georgia and Mississippi and a short-line railroad to
   <company id="40267">
    Koch Industries
   </company>
   subsidiary Koch Cellulose (now
   <company id="137986">
    GP Cellulose
   </company>
   ) for $610 million. It sold its building products distribution business to management and an affiliate of
   <company id="112328">
    Cerberus Capital Management
   </company>
   for about $810 million; the deal included the separate sale of the unit's real estate assets for another $100 million. Later that year, GP sold hardwood lumber mills in North Carolina, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania as well as its minority interest in pulp company Aracruz Celulose (Brazil). The combined transactions contributed nearly $2 billion toward the company's efforts to reduce its corporate debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 GP was acquired by Koch Industries -- a privately held company whose subsidiaries have interests ranging from oil and natural gas to chemicals and ranching -- in a deal worth $13.2 billion (plus the assumption of nearly $8 billion in debt). The company continues to operate from its Atlanta headquarters as a wholly owned subsidiary of Koch Industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the tumultuous years of the Great Recession, the housing slump and global financial crisis took their toll on builders and suppliers industrywide, and GP was no exception. In response, the company trimmed operations by shutting down or selling mills and cutting jobs. In early 2009 it sold a rosin sizing unit of its chemicals business.
  </p>
  <p>
   GP was eventually aided by the economic recovery that started to spread slowly during 2010. During that year, the company bought four compressed-board factories from Canada's Grant Forest Products for $400 million. It also bought a pair of Alabama pulp mills and other facilities from
   <company id="40356">
    Parsons &amp; Whittemore
   </company>
   for an undisclosed sum. In past years, GP expanded through acquisitions including five plywood and lumber facilities from
   <company id="10800">
    International Paper
   </company>
   , a containerboard mill from Smurfit-Stone Container (now
   <company id="58356">
    RockTenn CP
   </company>
   ), and insulated cup firm Insulair (which became a part of its Dixie unit).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has reshuffled its geographical footprint overseas. In mid-2012, it sold its European tissue operations to rival Svenska Cellulosa (SCA) for around $1.8 billion. The deal involved its former consumer and away-from-home tissue paper products and personal care businesses and manufacturing assets across Europe, including its popular Lotus brand of tissue paper. Also in 2012, GP dumped its stake in a joint venture in Turkey. Despite these moves, GP still maintains a European presence through regional offices for its GP Cellulose and GP Harmon Recycling operation
