        <p>
   Kid Brands' sales and profit growth spurt (2008 thru 2010) has stalled. In fiscal 2012 sales declined by 9% versus the prior year, and the company was unprofitable, posting a $54 million loss. Three of the company's four subsidiaries posted sales declines: Kids Line (down 20% year to year), CoCaLo (down 14%), and LaJobi (down 7%). (Sassy's sales got a boost from the acquisition of Kokopax, which designs and sells infant back carriers, sun hats, and totes.) The company blamed its poor performance on lower sales volume at certain large customers. The poor performance in 2012 followed a decline in sales of more than 8% in 2011 vs. 2010 and a net loss for the year.
  </p>
        <p>
   Declining sales to Kid Brands' largest customer have hurt performance. Indeed, sales to Toys "R" Us and Babies "R" have fallen by more than a third, from about 48% in 2010 to just 31% in 2012. While sales to retail-giant Wal-Mart nearly doubled over the same period, it wasn't enough to offset the loss.

        <p>
   With just three large customers accounting for more than 50% of sales, Kid Brands is vulnerable to the loss of or cutbacks by any single one. The company is working to expand its reach by developing and marketing products for older children (up to age seven). New products include toddler bedding and beds as well as kitchen products.
  </p>
        <p>
   Kid Brands is struggling to reverse its falling sales (and plummeting share price) following the dismissal of two senior managers as part of an investigation into incorrect payments of customs duties and the resignation of its CEO in 2011. After 18 months as interim CEO, Raphael Benaroya was named chairman, president, and CEO of the company in March 2013. Going forward, Kid Brands, which designs most of its own products, is concentrating on rolling out innovative branded products in its core markets, extending its reach into complementary categories, diversifying its distribution channels, collaborating among its subsidiaries to leverage sales and marketing opportunities, and aggressively managing its operating costs.

   and A With $500 in savings, toy-selling veteran Russell Berrie started Russ Berrie and Company, selling impulse gift items from a rented garage in 1963. The next year Russ Berrie had its first hit, a line of stuffed animals named "Fuzzy Wuzzies." Believing that control over sales was paramount to his company's success, Berrie hired his first full-time salesperson in 1968.
  </p>
        <p>
   Russ Berrie set up distribution centers in 1971 and 1972; it also purchased several manufacturing facilities in the mid-1970s. The company boosted its production ability over the next few years, and by 1977 it could make and sell a wide range of gifts and novelty items. However, manufacturing demands hindered Russ Berrie's creative impetus, so the company shut down or sold its factories. Russ Berrie went public in 1984. Three years later the company entered the retail market, acquiring Fluf N' Stuf, an East Coast chain of 21 gift stores. Russ Berrie acquired Bright of America (a marketer of candles, placemats, and aromatic products such as potpourri and incense) in 1990.
  </p>
        <p>
   Sales in 1992 received a boost when the company's Trolls (rubbery dolls with wiry, wild-colored hair) surged in popularity. The company ventured into toys in 1993, purchasing Cap Toys (makers of dolls and novelties), but the experience was short-lived; in 1997 Russ Berrie exited the toy business, selling its Cap Toys and OddzOn Products (sports toys and Koosh balls) subsidiaries to
   <company id="12007">
    Hasbro
   </company>
   for $166 million. The company exited the retail business in 1996 fearing it was competing with its core customers, small gift shops.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1998 Russ Berrie, in an effort to reduce costs, cut its sales force by 100. Investment firm
   <company id="99628">
    Evercore Partners
   </company>
   offered to buy all of the company but Berrie's stake in 1999; talks ended without a deal in early 2000. Late that year the company introduced its Luv Pets, beanbag dogs, cats, jungle animals, and sealife creatures made of a chamois-like material.
  </p>
        <p>
   Management of Bright of America acquired financing in late 2001 to buy the subsidiary. Russ Berrie debuted its Russ Home subsidiary in 2002 (home and garden accessories such as planters, lamps, wall plaques and mirrors, and tabletop items, all under the russhome name).
  </p>
        <p>
   In December 2002 founder Russell Berrie died; director Josh Weston was named acting chairman. In January 2003 Angelica Berrie, widow of Russell Berrie, was appointed CEO of Russ Berrie. In March the company merged Russ Home into its parent to leverage Russ Berrie's existing sales and operational infrastructure. In April 2004 Angelica Berrie stepped down as CEO (she remains vice chairman); Andrew Gatto, formerly of
   <company id="11495">
    Toys "R" Us
   </company>
   , joined the company as president and CEO.
  </p>
        <p>
   Russ Berrie sold its Bright of America division in August 2004. That October Russ Berrie was the winning bidder in an auction (conducted as part of
   <company id="48115">
    Dakin
   </company>
   's Chapter 11 reorganization) for the well-known gift and plush toy tradename "Applause." In December it purchased California-based Kids Line for about $128 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   In mid-2006 investors Prentice Capital Management (founded by Russ Berrie director Michael Zimmerman) and D.E. Shaw Laminar Portfolios acquired a 42% stake in the company from The Russell Berrie Foundation, the company's largest shareholder and owner of all the shares held by the estate of the late Russell Berrie, the company's founder, who died in 2002. The company did not receive any proceeds from the sale. As part of a reorganization plan to streamline its operations, the company shuttered its Petaluma, California, distribution center in early 2006. The move consolidated Russ Berrie's US warehousing and distribution operations into a single facility in New Jersey.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company reduced the size of its board of directors from 12 to nine members and named Michael Zimmerman as chairman in May 2007. Zimmerman replaced Josh Weston, who retired in January 2007. Bruce Crain replaced Andrew Gatto as president and CEO in late 2007.  In 2008 Raphael Benaroya succeeded Zimmerman as chairman of Russ Berrie. In December the company sold its gift business to The Encore Group, a privately held giftware company. Under the terms of the deal, Russ Berrie retained its "Russ" and "applause" brands, which it will license exclusively to Encore for five years for an annual royalty payment of about $1.2 million. Encore has the right to acquire the brands outright when the license expires.
  </p>
        <p>
   To underscore its shift from gifts to infant and juvenile products, the company in September 2009 renamed itself Kid Brands, Inc. (At that time it changed its NYSE ticker symbol from RUS to KID.)
  </p>
        <p>
   In January 2011 the company moved its headquarters from Wayne, New Jersey, to East Rutherford, New Jersey. In March the company terminated the president and another executive at its LaJobi subsidiary after an internal investigation regarding customs duty paid on wooden furniture imported from China. Crain resigned as CEO in September. He was succeeded by chairman Raphael Benaroya until a permanent replacement is found.
