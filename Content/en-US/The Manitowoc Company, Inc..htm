  <p>
   Some of MTW's Crane products are made and distributed by third parties through strategic alliances. Besides directly serving end-users in a variety of markets, the Crane segment markets products to value-added crane rental firms. Under the Crane Care brand name, MTW provides maintenance, repair, and parts supply.

   Revenues decreased by 12% from $3.90 billion in 2014 to $3.44 billion in 2015, and its net income dropped 56% from $145 million to $64 during that same time period. The decreases were driven by a year-over-year decrease in Crane segment sales, which were affected by weaker demand for rough terrain and boom truck cranes in the Americas region.

  <p>
   MTW in March 2016 spun off its Foodservice businesses in an effort to realize the full potential of each on a standalone basis.

   Expanding the company's international sales is also part of its growth strategy. In addition, Cranes is focused on the introduction of new tower and mobile cranes and on accelerating whole goods sales in emerging and developed markets.

  <p>
   Manitowoc began in 1902 when naval architect Charles West and shipbuilder Elias Gunnell bought a shipyard. The company grew during WWI, but the government canceled its contracts at war's end. After feuding with Gunnell, West bought Manitowoc (he would run it until his death in 1957) and diversified into industrial equipment. Crane manufacturing helped Manitowoc survive the Depression. During WWII Manitowoc built submarines and landing craft. After the war the company branched out into freezers and dry-cleaning machines.
