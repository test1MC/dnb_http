   If you lie down with dogs, Heska makes sure you don't get up with fleas. The company makes diagnostic products, vaccines, and pharmaceuticals for domestic animals, primarily cats and dogs. Its products -- both on the market and in development -- include diagnostics and treatments for allergies, arthritis, cancer, fleas, heartworms, skin problems, thyroid problems, and viral infections.&#160;As part of its business, Heska also operates a diagnostic lab and manufactures veterinary diagnostic and monitoring devices.&#160;The company&#160;develops&#160;vaccines for cattle, small mammals, and fish, as well.&#160;Products are sold worldwide&#160;through direct sales representatives and independent distributors.

        <p>
   Some of Heska's top products include the SOLO STEP line of heartworm diagnostic tests for cats and dogs, HEMATRUE Hematology Analyzer to measure a variety of blood parameters including white and red blood cell counts and hemoglobin levels, and the DRI-CHEM 7000, which has the capacity to run more than 20 tests with a single blood sample.
  </p>
        <p>
   The DRI-CHEM 7000 is a next-generation version of the DRI-CHEM 4000 and an example of how Heska grows its product lines by revamping best-sellers with additional features and capabilities. In 2012 Heska's wholly owned subsidiary Diamond Animal Health began to manufacture PetTrust Plus, a heartworm preventative product that's based on an existing

   -approved product. Once its products are sold, Heska continues to garner income on many of them through the sale of adjunct supplies and services.
  </p>
        <p>
   Heska is focused on developing external licensing deals and creating new collaborations to expand its product lines in both the CCA and its Other Vaccines, Pharmaceuticals, and Products (OVP) divisions. As part of this effort, Heska in 2011 expanded its products portfolio of in-clinic blood analyzers by launching a lactate meter analyzer.
  </p>
        <p>
   In the OVP segment, Heska is keenly focused on marketing and growing its line of bovine vaccines licensed by the

    USDA
   </company>
   . Heska also has a long-term, non-exclusive agreement with Agri Laboratories to market and sell some of Heska's bovine vaccines -- sold primarily under the Titanium and MasterGuard brands. The partnership generates a significant portion of OVP's revenue. OVP also produces vaccines and pharmaceuticals for other third parties.

   The company markets its animal health products in the US to veterinarians through an outside sales force of 40 individuals, an inside sales force of 20, and a few independent distributors. Internationally, Heska markets its products to veterinarians primarily through third-party veterinary diagnostic laboratories, independent distributors, and through a collaboration with Novartis Japan. Novartis Japan exclusively markets and distributes SOLO STEP CH and Heska's line of ERD HEALTHSCREEN urine test products in Japan.

   Net revenue for Heska rose some 7% in 2011 vs. 2010, boosted across its core business segments: core companion animal health and other vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and products. Sales of cattle vaccine helped this latter OVP segment's revenue rise, thanks in part to its fruitful contract with AgriLabs and sales of other cattle vaccines. Revenue increases were offset, however, by slower sales of its bulk bovine biological product.
  </p>
        <p>
   Heska has been vulnerable to the economic problems that have plagued the US in recent years, as families put off vet visits and, subsequently, vets themselves delay making major purchases. Additionally, the loss of a key supplier of Heska's handheld blood analyzer equipment had an adverse effect during both 2009 and 2010 on its core companion animal health business, which brings in roughly 82% of Heska's income. This macroeconomic drag on Heska's business in recent years puts into perspective the positive push the AgriLabs agreement has made to level out its revenue.
