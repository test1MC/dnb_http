The Ohio-based additives and dispersions company makes color and additive solutions used primarily in PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles used by soda and beer makers. Americhem's color and additives master batches also are used by the automotive, construction, synthetic fibers, packaging, and plastic materials industries. The company serves customers around the globe. Americhem ranks as one of North America's 30 largest makers of compounds and concentrates and specializes in color and additive masterbatches and single pigment dispersions.
