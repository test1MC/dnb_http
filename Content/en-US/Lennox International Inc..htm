   Lennox International makes sure the temperature is just right. The company makes climate control equipment such as heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration (HVACR) units for residential and commercial uses. It sells furnaces, heat pumps, fireplaces, and air conditioners under such brands as Lennox, Armstrong Air, and Aire-Flo; chillers and condensing units are sold under the Bohn and Larkin names. The heating-and-cooling maker's products are sold through some 7,000 dealers in the US and Canada. Lennox has operations in Asia, Australia, Europe, and South America. Named after inventor Dave Lennox, the company was founded in 1895.

  <p>
   Texas-based Lennox rang up 81% of its 2015 sales in the US. Canada, its second largest market, accounted for about 6% of sales. The company has manufacturing facilities in Australia and New Zealand, Brazil, China, France, and Germany. It also has a 50% interest in a joint venture in Mexico.
  </p>
  <p>
   The manufacturer serves customers in more than 70 countries worldwide.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company operates three business segments: Residential Heating and Cooling; Commercial Heating and Cooling; and Refrigeration.  Residential Heating and Cooling is Lennox's largest segment by sales, accounting for more than half of the total, and its most profitable. Commercial Heating and Cooling accounted for little over a quarter of the company's 2015 sales; Refrigeration, 20%.

  <p>
   Lennox's products are sold through a combination of direct sales, distributors, and company-owned parts and supplies stores. The company distributes its Armstrong Air, Ducane, Air-Ease, Concord, Magic-Pak and ADP brands through the traditional distribution process, whereby the company sells its products to distributors who, in turn, sell them to contractors for installation. Lennox's customer base is roughly evenly split between residential and commercial customers. New construction accounts for nearly two-thirds of sales, while the replacement market contributes the rest.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company uses the 'Dave Lennox' image in mass media advertising, as well as in numerous locally produced dealer advertisements, open houses and trade events. It distributes its 'Lennox' and 'Aire-Flo' brands directly to independent dealers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advertising, promotions and marketing allocations were $42.5 million, $41.9 million, and $45.2 million in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

  <p>
   Net sales of the company have seen an upward trend since 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2015 net sales increased by 3% due to increased sales from the Residential Heating and Cooling segment partially offset by decreased sales from Refrigeration segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Residential Heating and Cooling net sales were driven by strong volume increases and favorable price and mix. Sales volume increases were attributable to growth in the industry in new construction and replacement markets and market share gains.
  </p>
  <p>
   Refrigeration net sales declined as the result of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the impact from the Australian carbon levy repeal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income decreased by $19.2 million compared to 2014 due to increased losses and other expenses and asset impairment expense partially offset by increased sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the fourth quarter, the company completed a strategic review of its North American supermarket display cases and systems business. As a result, it performed an impairment analysis and recorded an Asset Impairment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Losses and other expenses in 2015 grew mainly due to increased special legal contingency charges, foreign currency exchange losses, and added contractor tax payments.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 net cash provided by the operating activities increased by 79% due to a change in inventories and income taxes payable and receivable.

  <p>
   After seeing its sales slip amid soft consumer demand and a sluggish market for residential construction during the housing crisis, Lennox cut costs. It adopted lean manufacturing practices and worked to improve efficiency at certain facilities in order to reduce waste. Lennox also divested and consolidated some operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Internationally, Lennox is expanding its geographic footprint, especially in developing markets, such as China. The company is increasing the size of its manufacturing facilities there in anticipation of growth in the cold storage market.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's business strategy is to sustain and expand its premium market position as well as offer a full spectrum of products. It has plans to expand its market position through organic growth and acquisitions while maintaining its focus on cost reductions to drive margin expansion and support growth in target business segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its strategy is supported by its five strategic priorities which are Innovative product and system Solutions, Manufacturing and sourcing excellence, Distribution excellence, Geographic expansion and Expense reduction.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company underwent restructuring primarily for projects to realign resources and enhance distribution capabilities in its Refrigeration segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 Lennox's Heatcraft Worldwide Refrigeration segment released the Mohave Remote Refrigeration Control (RRC), an innovative internet-based control system that allows end-users to manage their refrigeration systems using any web browser, from anywhere in the world.

  <p>
   Inventors Ernest Bryant and Ezra Smith developed and patented a riveted-steel sheet metal coal furnace in Marshalltown, Iowa, in the 1890s. The cast iron furnaces in use at the time tended to warp with usage; the sheet metal furnace did not. The inventors hired machine shop operator Dave Lennox to build the manufacturing equipment necessary to produce the new furnace. They were underfunded, however, and Lennox took over the patents in lieu of payment and redesigned the furnace. However, Lennox didn't warm to the furnace business and sold out to D. W. Norris, the local newspaper publisher, and three other people for $40,000 in 1904.
  </p>
  <p>
   Norris, the company's first president, incorporated the business as Lennox Furnace Company and sold about 600 units the first year. Norris soon established the company's method of selling and delivering directly to authorized dealers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lennox built a manufacturing plant in New York in 1925 and acquired Armstrong Furnace, a steel coal furnace plant in Ohio, in 1927. That year John Norris, D. W.'s son, joined the company after graduating from
   <company id="40300">
    MIT
   </company>
   . The younger Norris pushed for new innovations such as oil burners, gas furnaces, and blowers. He set up a research department in the 1930s and soon developed a line of gas- and oil-burning furnaces. The company opened another Ohio plant in 1940 and bought a machine shop there in 1942 to make bomb and aircraft parts for WWII. John Norris became president after the death of his father in 1949.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company established Lennox Industries (Canada) Ltd. in 1952. Norris began developing an air conditioner the same year, after shopping the idea around to his dealers. Soon the company was turning out residential, commercial, and industrial air conditioners and compressors. In 1955 the company's name was changed to Lennox Industries Inc. to reflect its broader product range. The international division was created in 1962. Soon manufacturing facilities were established outside London and other offices were opened in the Netherlands and West Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lennox acquired Heatcraft, a maker of heating and cooling components, in 1973. Headquarters were moved to Dallas in 1978; in 1980 John Norris Jr. was named CEO. Lennox International Inc. (LII) was formed as the parent company for Heatcraft and Lennox Industries in 1986. The company reacquired Armstrong Air Conditioning (which it had owned in the 1920s and sold in the mid-1950s) in 1988. LII went public in 1999 and began buying HVAC dealers.
