   The ingredients that make up Corbion (formerly CSM) are, well, ingredients. Founded in 1919 as a Dutch sugar manufacturer, Corbion makes and distributes bio-based food ingredients and biochemicals to food retailers and processors and institutional food service operations worldwide. As part of a massive recent reorganization, Corbion sold its Bakery Supplies business, which supplied  bakery products and ingredients. It retained its Purac subsidiary, which makes lactic acid, lactic-acid derivatives, and lactides, which it sells to food, chemical, and pharmaceutical customers. Corbion has operations in some 20 countries. In 2013 the company changed its name from CSM to Corbion and unveiled a new strategy.

  <p>
   Amsterdam-based Corbion's largest market is North America, representing nearly two-thirds of its annual sales. Europe, the Middle East, and Africa contributes about 20%. It also has customers in Asia.

   Newly-reorganized Corbion reported sales of €743.6 million ($945.6 million) in 2013, representing organic sales growth of 1.5%. The company's gross profit was €203 million ($258.2 million).

  <p>
   The company changed its name from CSM to Corbion in 2013 and underwent a transformation from a low-margin bakery-led company to a high-growth bio-based products business. The restructuring involved the divestment of 75% of the company's sales, about 80% of its employees, and most of its factories. The reorganization positioned Corbion to compete in the bio-based food ingredients and biochemicals markets. The firm is focusing on the bakery and meat sectors.
  </p>
  <p>
   CSM's Purac division operates in the fields of food preservation, green chemicals, and bio-plastics components produced from lactic acid, lactic acid derivatives, and other fermentation-based products. The company is investing in expanding its lactic acid capacity in 2014/2015 to drive future growth.

  <p>
   In July 2013, Corbion sold its North American and European Bakery Supplies businesses to affiliates of Rhône Capital. The Bakery Supplies businesses had an Enterprise Value of € 1,050 million, In March 2013, Corbion's Purac subsidiary acquired BIRD Engineering, a Netherlands-based biotech contract research firm, specializing in the filed of industrial microbiology. The purchase of BIRD brought expertise in bacteria and yeasts, and the development of new strains and fermentation processes.

  <p>
   CSM was formed in 1919 with the combination of Wester Suikerranffinaderij (Wester), an export-oriented raw sugar refinery; condensed-milk processor Hollandsche Fabriek van Melkproducten en Voeningsmiddelen (Hollandia); and sugar manufacturer Van Loon &amp; Co.
  </p>
  <p>
   The combined company immediately closed four factories and centralized sugar beet distribution. Money was also invested abroad; the company took stakes in Polish sugar factories in order to obtain raw sugar and prepare for exports to Britain. In 1924, when the British government offered CSM and others in the sugar beet industry a subsidy, the company moved into Britain, setting up three factories in three years.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1930s the company suffered from numerous difficulties related to the economic and political climate in Europe. In 1932 the company reorganized, selling all foreign investments and reducing capital by 70%.When directors of CSM again sought to grow the company in 1937, they took over a family-owned jam factory. WWII, however, forced the company to hold off on future growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   The late 1950s proved to be a turning point for the company. It had become clear that CSM's outdated machinery would not allow the company to refine sugar efficiently. Meanwhile, increased beet and sugar production affected both its national and export businesses. In 1958 the company sold its foundering jam business in hopes of focusing on biochemicals.
  </p>
  <p>
   CSM had first created a research laboratory in 1946 to investigate opportunities in sugar-based chemical products. Following an attempted takeover by sugar cooperatives in 1964, the company returned its focus to the division, merging it with lactic acid producer Schiedamse Melkzuurfabriek and increasing its size. The new company was named Chemie Combinatie Amsterdam CCA (CCA).
  </p>
  <p>
   CSM began to acquire established products with good positioning in their respective markets, including Red Band gums, King Peppermints, and Droste Chocolates. It also purchased key bakery ingredients brands De Ruijter and Venz. In addition, the company picked up pasta companies in Italy, Belgium, and Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the late 1970s and early 1980s, it appeared that the company's strategies were working. The sugar division had stabilized, the food division was flourishing, and the biochemical company fared so well that CSM bought all its shares. The company used the profits from its growing businesses to make acquisitions in North America and Europe throughout the 1990s. Having acquired companies such as Hak BV, US confectionery maker Henry &amp; Henry, and Canadian baking ingredients manufacturer Kirkland &amp; Rose, the company became a global force in food products and baking ingredients.
  </p>
  <p>
   When in 1995 CSM declined to comply with new rules put forth by the Amsterdam Stock Exchange that would have limited the defensive measures a company could take against aggressive takeover bids, the exchange threatened to delist the company's shares. CSM won the battle in court.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, through the 1990s, the company continued acquiring companies in the Americas and Europe. In 1999 the company bought Hutamaki's Leaf Unit, which tripled the size of its confectionery business. In 2000 CSM acquired
   <company id="41850">
    Unilever
   </company>
   's Bakery Ingredients Unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2001 the company began to refocus on its core products by selling its food products division (including the Venz, De Ruijter, HAK, Brinta, and Honig brands) to US food producer
   <company id="10693">
    H. J. Heinz
   </company>
   for about $391 million. Then, later in 2001, the company purchased Italy's Socalbe, (confectionery, tea, and coffee), and announced an agreement to purchase fruit-filling maker Hero Nederland.
  </p>
  <p>
   CSM started 2002 by selling off the Italian coffee and tea business and announcing its purchase of Besser, an Italian bakery-supplies wholesaler, and US bakery-supplies maker Carpro, owner of H.C. Brill (icings, glazes, cookie dough, and frozen cakes to retail outlets) and Caravan Products (bread bases, mixes, stabilizers, and frozen dough to wholesalers). In 2003 CSM acquired the powdered-cake-mix operations of Dutch dairy company,
   <company id="92167">
    Friesland Coberco Dairy Foods.
   </company>
  </p>
  <p>
   Suffering from poor profits, in 2004 CSM decided to sell its confectionery business, which represented one-fifth of its sales, to investment firm
   <company id="60139">
    CVC Capital Partners
   </company>
   for $1 billion; completed the sale in 2005. Also that year, the company sold its Sugar Confectionary division to CVC Capital for €850 million (about $1.1 billion). CEO Jaap Vink resigned in 2005 and food industry veteran Gerard Hoetmer succeeded him.
  </p>
  <p>
   Turning to its US production, CSM acquired US-based CGI Desserts in 2006 for $70 million. CGI is a manufacturer of thaw-and-serve bakery products for foodservice and in-store bakery operations. It also acquired
   <company id="10124">
    ADM
   </company>
   's Specialty Bakery Ingredients USA for $55 million, and Boston-based frozen-bakery company that serves the foodservice sector, Titterington's, for $23 million. In 2007, CSM sold its North American bakery ingredients unit, Illinois-based QA Products, to Ireland's
   <company id="91314">
    Kerry Group
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 CSM sold its sugar business to Dutch sugar producer,
   <company id="161603">
    Royal Cosun
   </company>
   , for $202 million. The sale of the sugar operations was made because CSM decided to concentrate on those businesses in which it is the market leader in order to improve its competitiveness.
  </p>
  <p>
   In October 2013, CSM nv changed its legal name to Corbion nv.
