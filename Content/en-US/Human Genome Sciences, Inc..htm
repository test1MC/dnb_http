   Human Genome Sciences (HGS) starts at the molecular level for good health. Using its expertise in human genetics, the biopharmaceutical discovery and development firm is working on therapies for infectious and autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Lead candidate Benlysta has gained
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval to treat systemic lupus and has since been extended into international markets. Benlysta was developed through a partnership with
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   (which acquired HGS in 2012). In addition, the company has provided contract research and manufacturing services to other biotechs.

  <p>
   HGS is a part of the Immuno-inflammation unit of the Pharmaceuticals segment of parent
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Immuno-inflammation contributes 1% of the revenues of the Pharmaceuticals segment (which accounts for 68% of the parent company's total revenues). In 2013 revenues from Benlysta was £146 million, with £134 million coming from the US.

  <p>
   Partner GSK had decided it wanted full rights to Benlysta and other candidates and made an unsuccessful, unsolicited offer to buy HGS for some $2.6 billion, or $13 a share, in cash. After GSK enriched its offer to $14.25 per share, or $3 billion, HGS agreed to the deal, and the acquisition was finalized in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   HGS has high hopes that Benlysta will skyrocket it into the big leagues among biopharma companies. Benlysta is expected to become a blockbuster seller (reaching over $1 billion in sales), as it is the first new lupus drug approved by the FDA in more than 50 years. To support the drug's launch, HGS built up a sales organization to market Benlysta in the US and Europe, where it co-markets the drug with GSK. In other global markets, GSK has full commercial responsibilities. Aimed first at treating lupus, the drug may eventually be used to treat a variety of immune disorders and to help kidney transplant patients.

   The company earned its first revenues from sales of a product in 2009 when it delivered 20,000 doses of anthrax treatment raxibacumab to the US government for its bioterrorism stockpile. The company reported $154 millin in revenues that year related to raxibacumab. Also in 2009, the government ordered another 45,000 doses to be delivered over a three-year period; the company earned $47 million product revenues in 2010 and another $52 million in 2011 related to the order.

   HGS was founded in 1992.

  <p>
   When Human Genome Sciences (HGS) was founded in 1992, with funding from Wallace Steinberg's
   <company id="104983">
    HealthCare Ventures
   </company>
   , it was clear that the Department of Energy's Human Genome Project was viable and that private industry ought to get on the bandwagon. Steinberg tapped Harvard don William Haseltine to lead the new company. HGS was to fund research performed by The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR), which was led by Craig Venter. A star of the Project, Venter's method for speeding up the Project (mapping small gene sequences for later assembly in a completed map) had been rejected by colleagues.
  </p>
  <p>
   TIGR began using gene sequencers from
   <company id="11167">
    Applied Biosystems
   </company>
   to churn out DNA sequences. The next year Haseltine licensed the resulting data to SmithKline Beecham (now
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   ) for possible product development. Other data licensing -- as well as product development --  agreements followed.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Haseltine's drive to commercialize TIGR's results clashed with Venter's desire to publish his research results immediately, and the relationship between the two entities was severed. Under the terms of the split, HGS stopped funding TIGR and renounced rights to future genetic information. Venter continued his quest to map the entire genome at
   <company id="59696">
    Celera
   </company>
   , while Haseltine, with his own complement of sequencers, zeroed in on expressive genes and then on product development.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 HGS initiated clinical trials of two drugs: Mirostipen, aimed at reducing the toxicity of certain cancer chemotherapies, and Repifermin, which targeted mucosal and skin tissue repair.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm continued to uncode DNA in 1999, with discoveries in the fields of Hodgkin's lymphoma causation and immunology offering possible applications to AIDS (in 2000 it was awarded a patent for uncovering a possible genetic mechanism for AIDS infection). In 2000 HGS was caught up in the euphoria caused by the race to complete the gene map and the subsequent biotech plunge when President Clinton and UK Prime Minister Blair endorsed open access to raw genome data (which isn't patentable anyway). Also that year it bought privately held Principia Pharmaceutical, from which it gained a drug delivery technology using the blood protein albumin that it began developing for hepatitis C uses in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   When licensing agreements with major drugmakers for its gene database expired in June 2001, HGS opted not to make any more agreements, keeping the information largely for its own drug development activities. Anticipating the approval of its drug candidates, the company began building a manufacturing plant to make commercial products in October of that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company, like many drug developers, hit a snag. HGS stopped development of Mirostipen, a potential therapy for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, after early clinical trials showed the drug candidate was not as effective as its developers had hoped it would be. Instead, the company forwarded Albugranin, a different type of drug for the same condition, into clinical trials.
  </p>
  <p>
   To reduce costs, the company in 2004 halted work on about half of its drug candidates. HGS also streamlined its operations, consolidated facilities, and fired about 20% of its staff. The downsizing was an indication that using gene-based therapies to address unmet medical needs might not be as successful as scientists had originally hoped. Two of the company's most promising drug candidates had failed to meet expectations. Later that year, founding chairman and CEO William Haseltine retired to make way for more business-oriented leaders.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to focus on its later-stage development projects, in 2006 the company spun off its CoGenesys unit, which it had formed to handle early drug development efforts and to outlicense some assets the company wasn't interested in developing itself. HGS retained a 14% stake in the unit until 2008, when CoGenesys was acquired by Israeli drugmaker
   <company id="52434">
    Teva
   </company>
   . In addition to receiving $52.6 million from the sale, HGS retained the right to receive a portion of any revenues Teva received from future sales of the products it gained.
