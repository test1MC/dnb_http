   Saputo is the big cheese in Canada. The country's #1 dairy processor, Saputo produces staple and specialty cheeses for sale to retail, food service, and industrial customers, mainly in Canada and the US. Armstrong, Frigo, Stella, and Treasure Cave, are some of its big brands. Saputo also distributes imported cheeses to the Canadian consumer retail market. Its dairy items include Neilson and Dairyland label fluid milk and yogurt, and dairy ingredients. Originally a small mozzarella maker, Saputo has grown through acquisitions. To focus on its core dairy operations, the company in 2015 sold its Bakery Division to
   <company id="118675">
    Canada Bread Company
   </company>
   .

   Since going public in 1997, Saputo has acquired some two dozen companies spanning Canada, the US and UK, Germany, and Argentina. Most recently, in 2013 it bought Morningstar Foods from
   <company id="42651">
    Dean Foods
   </company>
   for $1.45 billion. (Morningstar makes Friendship brand cottage cheese and private label diary products such as creamers, ice cream mix, and sour cream. The purchase included 10 manufacturing plants in nine states.)

   As it grows, Saputo is striving to improve efficiency. To that end, in early 2015 it sold its Bakery Division to
   <company id="118675">
    Canada Bread Company
   </company>
   , a subsidiary of
   <company id="95052">
    Grupo Bimbo S.A.B. de C.V.
   </company>
   , for $120 million. The company also closed its cheese manufacturing plant in Warwick, Quebec, in June 2014. In January 2014, its plant in Manitoba is slated for closure. Production from these plants were moved to other facilities in Quebec.
