   There is general agreement that Agrium is a top producer and marketer of fertilizers in the Americas. A leader in the production of nitrogen, the company operates plants in 14 countries on six continents, producing about 10 million tons of nitrogen, potash, and phosphate products per year. In addition to supplying wholesalers, Agrium operates fertilizer an extensive network of retail outlets across the North America, South America, and Australia. The company also owns 50% of Profertil, a joint venture with Spain's
   <company id="41831">
    Repsol YPF
   </company>
   that runs Argentina's largest nitrogen plant, and 25% of a nitrogen fertilizer plant in Egypt. In 2016 the company entered into talks to merge with
   <company id="51140">
    Potash Corp
   </company>
   .
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Agrium Wholesale owns 15 production plants in North and South America across the nitrogen, potash and phosphate spectrum; three mines; and an extensive distribution and storage network throughout North America and internationally through Agrium Europe. Agrium's Retail business unit markets crop nutrients, crop protection products, seed, merchandise, application and other agronomic services via 1,220 retail locations in the US, Canada, Australia (including franchise outlets), Argentina, Chile, Brazil, and Uruguay.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Agrium operates in two segments -- Wholesale and Retail. The company's Retail business provides crop inputs and services directly to farmers, offers several agronomic services in addition to the custom application services and soil and petiole testing. Agrium's Retail crop protection business was 34% of that unit's total sales in 2012. In North America, glyphosate accounted for 10% of Retail crop protection sales in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Wholesale business (which operates in North and South America and Europe) produces, markets, and distributes all major crop nutrients for agricultural and industrial customers. It also owns 50% of Profertil (a nitrogen facility in Argentina) and owns and operates a number of facilities that upgrade ammonia and urea to other products such as urea ammonium nitrate solutions and nitric acid. Agrium Wholesale has a total nitrogen production capacity of five million tons a year. In addition, Agrium holds a 26% interest in a urea facility located in Egypt. About 37% of Agrium's Canada-based Vanscoy's potash production is sold internationally.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's revenues grew by 8% to $16.7 billion inl 2012 thanks to double digit growth in Retail segment and Advanced Technologies, offset by decrease in sales from Wholesale segment. The Retail segment revenue increased by 11%, driven by the combination of strong global crop prices, increased planted acreage across key agricultural regions, as well as one of the earliest North American spring seasons in history and an extended fall application season, which supported robust demand for crop input products and services. Acquisitions a strong retail performance in Australia also lifted revenues
  </p>
  <p>
   Wholesale revenues declined by 2% in 2012 due to lower potash and phosphate prices and reduced potash sales volumes, offset by stronger nitrogen sales volumes and margins.
  </p>
  <p>
   Agrium's net income increased by 9% to $1.5 billion in 2012 due to increased gross profit from its Retail operations, coupled with no negative effects from discontinued operations (compared to a $133 million loss from discontinued operations in 2011). This was offset by higher selling expenses and general and administrative expenses stemming from increased share-based payments expenses in 2012.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's strategy is to expand its business segments with both strategic acquisitions and organic growth through a combination of capacity expansions, improvements to its operating model, and maintaining strong industry fundamentals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Agrium had operated in three business units -- Retail, Wholesale, and Advanced Technologies -- but in 2014, following a strategic review, the company folded its Advanced Technologies business unit (environmentally smart nitrogen and micronutrients) into its Wholesale business to more effectively leverage Wholesale's strengths in manufacturing and distribution.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company continued to build for future growth in Wholesale capacity and earnings with expansion projects in both potash and nitrogen. This included building a $1.5 billion brownfield potash expansion project (to be completed in 2014) that will increase Agrium's annual production capacity by 1 million tons, and evaluating potential nitrogen expansion opportunities in North America.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2013 Agrium expanded its retail operations by acquiring some of
   <company id="160730">
    Viterra's
   </company>
   assets from Glencore International (since renamed
   <company id="101467">
    Glencore Xstrata
   </company>
   ). The $300 million buy gave Agrium Viterra's Canadian retail facilities, all of its Australian retail facilities, and a minority stake in its nitrogen plant in Alberta.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also completed a significant number of smaller Retail acquisitions in 2012, primarily in the US. In total, it bought 59 retail locations (representing annual sales of $477-million). The largest of these purchases was West Texas Agriplex Inc. (12 locations in West Texas); Ritter Crop Services, Inc. (seven locations across Northeast Arkansas); and Utilfértil Indústria E Comércio De Fertilizantes Ltda. in Southern Brazil (which builds on its existing Retail presence in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay).

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Agrium was formed in 1992 to facilitate the reorganization of Cominco's fertilizer division and to acquire the fertilizer business of the Alberta Energy Company (1993). Cominco was founded in 1896 as the Smelting and Refining Company when Fritz Heinze fired up his first smelter at Trail Creek Landing, British Columbia. Using the ores of the nearby Rossland mines, the company soon diversified into other products (such as fertilizers) and new metallurgical technologies. In 1906 the Smelting and Refining Company, the Rossland mines, and the nearby St. Eugene Mine merged to form the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada Limited.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWI the Canadian government conscripted all the company's lead, zinc, and chemical production and instructed the company to make explosive-grade ammonium nitrate at its fertilizer plants. Cominco became the company's official name in 1966.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alberta Energy was formed in 1973 to lessen Alberta's dependence on foreign oil, in response to the OPEC oil embargo. In 1989 its petrochemical division established fertilizer (ammonium nitrate) subsidiaries in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Agrium was established to compete in the rapidly consolidating fertilizer market (the number of North American ammonia producers fell from 55 in 1980 to 26 at the end of 1996). The phosphate and potash industries also consolidated, albeit on a smaller scale.
  </p>
  <p>
   Between 1993 and 1996 the company expanded its US operations by acquiring Crop Protection Services and Western Farm Service (both retail operations), AG-BIO (the phosphate-based fertilizer business of Imperial Oil), and Nu-West Industries. Agrium expanded into South America in 1995 by opening retail sales units for selling fertilizer, agricultural chemicals, and other services in the farming regions of Argentina.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 Agrium acquired Viridian, a Canadian fertilizer producer with nitrogen- and phosphate-based fertilizer plants in Alberta. Expanding its supply base, the company bought a phosphate mine in Alberta in 1997. The company also bought back 10% of its shares in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   Agrium opened a phosphate rock mine in Ontario in 1999 to reduce its reliance on phosphate rock imported from West Africa. In 2000 Agrium bought
   <company id="11569">
    Unocal
   </company>
   's nitrogen-based fertilizer operations for around $325 million, thereby increasing its nitrogen production capacity some 60%. Also that year Agrium's Profertil nitrogen plant, a joint venture with Spain's industrial giant Repsol-YPF, began production in Argentina, but the plant was shut down by a government agency following an accidental discharge of ammonia (the plant was reopened later in 2000).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company continued to expand its retail business in North and South America through acquisitions in 2006 of other agricultural products and services, such as Nu-Gro and Pursell Technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 it bought agricultural products retailer UAP for $2.5 billion, including assumed debt. In the latter half of the decade, Agrium has implemented an aggressive expansion strategy by acquiring a number of businesses throughout the Americas. The deal for UAP was the largest by far. It greatly added to Agrium's North American retail operations and also expanded the company's international reach.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other acquisitions have included agricultural products distributor Royster-Clark and two divisions of Spectrum Brands' Nu-Gro subsidiary. The Nu-Gro deal formed the base of Agrium's Advanced Technologies unit, which supplies agricultural products and services in North and South America and sells branded micronutrients and other industrial products worldwide (such as control-released fertilizers for the turf grass, horticulture, and consumer agriculture markets).
  </p>
  <p>
   Agrium made a $5.2 billion hostile offer for
   <company id="40088">
    CF Industries
   </company>
   amidst a four-company, year-long bidding war that also included Yara Industries and
   <company id="10787">
    Terra Industries
   </company>
   . Agrium withdrew its offer to buy CF Industries after that company successfully acquired Terra. After a 2009 bid for CF Industries fell short, Agrium acquired Australian wheat exporter AWB Ltd. for $1.2 billion in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   The AWB deal enhanced its market presence and improved its product and service offerings in Australia and New Zealand. However, soon after the deal closed, Agrium sold AWB's commodity management businesses to Cargill Incorporated in a deal valued at $917 million. Agrium absorbed the rest of AWB's assets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also purchased 24 retail farm centers in Argentina in 2010 from DuPont Crop Protection. The deal expanded Agrium's Loveland crop-protection products into additional South American countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Agrium acquired CerealToscana S.A., a fertilizer distribution company in Italy, and Agroport, its subsidiary in Romania, for $27 million.  The combined companies have a stable financial record with gross sales of some $200 million. The deal enhanced Agrium Europe's existing fertilizer distribution business.
