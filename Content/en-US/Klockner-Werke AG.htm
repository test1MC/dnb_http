   Like clockwork, Klöckner-Werke has been making packaging equipment since 1923. Klöckner-Werke, acquired by
   <company id="106461">
    Salzgitter Group
   </company>
   in 2007, is a group holding company for subsidiaries conducting plant engineering and machine construction, with the primary focus on packaging machinery and filling equipment for the food, non-food, and beverage industries. The company's packaging technologies are used for cleaning, labeling, label-removing, and inspection uses. Other units manufacture automation and robotic systems, molding machines used for plastics processing and safety shoe soling, and machinery for the confectionery industry. Klöckner-Werke gets more than half of its sales from Europe and exports 90% of its goods.

  <p>
   Klöckner-Werke's beginnings can be traced to 1897 when the iron and steel company Lothringer Bergwerks- und Hüttenverein Aumetz-Friede was founded. The company had coal and blast furnace holdings in what was then German territory. In 1903 Peter Klöckner became a board member of that company and was named chairman in 1913. Under Klöckner's leadership the company added more coal mines and it flourished during the industrialization that preceded WWI. After the war, however, Lothringer Bergwerks- und Hüttenverein Aumetz-Friede and some of its holdings were returned to France, as country boundaries changed. Klöckner began to rebuild what was left of the company in Germany and in 1923 created Klöckner-Werke in the process.
  </p>
  <p>
   Klöckner-Werke, which had close ties to Klöckner &amp; Co. (Peter Klöckner's trading company), expanded its coal mine and iron business while diversifying into fertilizers, automobiles, and engineering works, among other non-core operations. The company weathered the Great Depression as the demand for steel remained relatively healthy.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWII air raids damaged much of the company's property, including its mines, and the company's Oberursel automobile factory was converted to a repair shop for Allied vehicles. Following the war the company split into several different companies in compliance with decentralization efforts imposed by the Allied Control Commission. In 1953 the company was forced to cut its ties with its engine, engineering works, and automobile subsidiary Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz (now
   <company id="102503">
    DEUTZ AG
   </company>
   ). Klöckner-Werke also lost its close affiliation with
   <company id="92205">
    Klöckner &amp; Co
   </company>
   . during that period. However, in 1954, as the Allied Control Commission relaxed its regulations, Klöckner-Werke regained control of its disassembled enterprise and resumed operations as a single production company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also during the 1950s and into the 1960s the company began to diversify into mine construction equipment, electric power stations, fiberglass, and plastics. In 1974 Herbert Gienow, who had been a director of the company since 1962, became Klöckner-Werke's chairman and led the company (until his retirement in 1991) to further diversification in an effort to weather the worst years of the steel crisis (1974-1984). Gienow reorganized the steel segment, expanded the company's machinery and plastics division, and began to internationally expand its holdings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1988 and 1989 the company significantly increased its stakes in engineering and plastics companies, including the purchase of 98% of Europe's largest supplier of plastics for auto parts. However, still dealing with its dependence on the ailing steel industry, the company filed protection from its creditors in 1992 and began efforts to exit the steel business altogether the following year. The company shed its steel operations little by little and ceased being a steel company by the end of the 1990s.
  </p>
  <p>
   With its new direction, emphasizing plastics and machinery, the company returned to prosperity. In 1999 Klöckner-Werke sold its Peguform car components subsidiary. The following year
   <company id="102684">
    WCM Beteiligungs- und Grundbestiz
   </company>
   , the company's largest shareholder, offered to purchase the shares of Klöckner-Werke that it didn't already own.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="131662">
    Klöckner Pentaplast
   </company>
   , the subsidiary which made hard foils and rigid plastic films for food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical packaging, and for credit cards, was sold to
   <company id="102597">
    Cinven
   </company>
   (a private equity firm) for more than $800 million in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2006 WCM was declared insolvent; its 78% equity stake in Klöckner-Werke was deposited with HSH Nordbank. In early 2007 the Salzgitter Group agreed to acquire WCM's holding in Klöckner-Werke. The transaction was completed in mid-2007.
