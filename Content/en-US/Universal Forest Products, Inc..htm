  <p>
   Universal Forest is working to extend its reach into areas where there is potential for growth by diversifying through a series of acquisitions in recent years. From 2012 through early 2015, it's been purchasing both industrial lumber and specialized packing companies that have helped the company enrich its wood services expertise, enter new markets, and expand into new geographic markets (including one purchase which expanded its presence internationally into Australia), with the goal of making the company more resistant to future dips and downturns in the homebuilding market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Universal Forest still embraces its construction roots. Although fewer manufactured homes are being built, Universal Forest anticipates that by offering more products it can gain a larger share of the remaining market. Recent acquisitions include manufacturers of treated wood, composite products, engineered wood components, millwork, ornamental woodwork, truss work, and related construction materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through all these strategies, Universal Forest plans to reach $3 billion in sales by 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   A key component of the company's growth strategy is to complete business combinations.  Business combinations involve inherent risks, including assimilation and successfully managing growth. The company's goal is to increase ssales by developing new, value-added products, international business expansion, and gaining additional market share.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has focused on its growth strategy through acquisitions. It completed two acquisitions during 2015 and five during 2014.
