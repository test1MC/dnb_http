   If every chicken tells a story, then JFC has plenty of fine-feathered tales to tell. Founded as a mail-order hatchery for other producers, the family-owned company has grown into a fully integrated poultry processor. Its Just BARE line for upscale and foodservice clients, features anitbiotic-free chickens that are fed a vegetarian diet. Its broader Gold'n Plump brand consists of fresh, frozen, and value-added chicken products, such as rotisserie chicken in "grab and go" packages and bake-it-in-the-package entrees. JFC's poultry products are sold to retail food and foodservice customers nationwide. The company's primary product is sourced through some 350 poultry farmers located in Minnesota and Wisconsin.
