   Husband and wife John MacBain and Louise Blouin MacBain founded the company as Hebdo Mag in Montreal in 1987. Acting as co-CEOs, the pair started with four Canadian classified ad publications, acquiring 40 more over the next two years. Trying to head off growing competition from niche publishers, Canadian publisher Torstar (
   <i>
    The Toronto Star,
   </i>
   Harlequin romance novels) bought 50% of the company in 1989.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hebdo Mag expanded its geographical presence during the early 1990s, buying classified ad publications in France, Hungary, Sweden, and the US. It established a Web presence in 1996, but didn't generate online sales until three years later. By 1997 Hebdo Mag's had acquired more than 150 classified ad publications in 13 countries. That year US consumer service company CUC International bought out Torstar's and the MacBains' interests in the company (the MacBains continued operating Hebdo Mag). Later in 1997 CUC International merged with HFS Incorporated to form diversified conglomerate Cendant.

   Now operating as a Cendant subsidiary, Hebdo Mag continued growing, acquiring classified ad publications in Argentina, Australia, and Spain. In 1998, however, Cendant's infamous accounting irregularities were exposed, and it began selling off noncore assets. At the close of 1998, the MacBains formed Trader.com in Amsterdam and bought Hebdo Mag's assets back from Cendant. (Cendant later broke itself into four separate divisions and stopped using the name Cendant.) They simultaneously sold 29% of their new company to French investment firm CGIP.

   Among the 14 publications Trader.com acquired in 1999 were
   <i>
    Auto Trader
   </i>
   (Canada),
   <i>
    Wheels and Deals
   </i>
   (US), and
   <i>
    Trueque
   </i>
   (Spain). The company established its umbrella portal that year then went public on both the Nasdaq and Paris Stock Exchanges in 2000. The company later expanded into Germany with acquisitions of
   <i>
    Avis
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Revier Markt.
   </i>
   In response to the internet shakeout in 2001, the firm laid off 275 workers and closed 15 websites, but MacBain also took the company's problems personally, giving up his salary and options for two years. In 2001 the MacBains divorced. The company changed its name to Trader Classified Media in 2002. Later that year Trader bought ExitInfo, which publishes
   <i>
    Travel Coupon Guides
   </i>
   , from
   <company id="40258">
    PRIMEDIA
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company switched gears in 2006 following a strategic review. Yellow Pages acquired the business, which reorganized to form Trader Corporation. The company exited the US market (Tennessee, Indiana, and Kentucky) when it sold those assets in 2008. The move was part of a larger effort to cut costs that year.

  <p>
   Yellow Pages sold Trader Corporation to private equity firm
   <company id="40358">
    Apax Partners
   </company>
   for $708 million in 2011.
