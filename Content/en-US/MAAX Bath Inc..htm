   A house is a castle when it's built with a MAAX bathtub in mind. MAAX Bath designs and manufactures a variety of acrylic, fiberglass, and thermoplastic bathtubs, as well as tub showers and stand alone showers under brand names Advanta, Aker, Keystone, MAAX Collection, and MAAX Professional. Other products include shower doors, faucets, walls and bases, and medicine cabinets. The company sells to the residential housing market, namely, plumbing wholesalers, hardware stores and superstores, specialty showrooms, and distributors, via nine plants and distribution centers in North America. In 2008 MAAX's assets were acquired by Tricap Partners Ltd., a restructuring group managed by

  <p>
   Placide Poulin founded Modern Fibreglass Inc. in 1969 to manufacture fiberglass parts for snowmobiles and swimming pools. To diversify its seasonal operations, the company started manufacturing fiberglass bathtubs and showers in 1974. By 1980 it had dropped its snowmobile business to focus solely on bathroom products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1986 the company, which was doing business in eastern Canada and throughout New England, introduced its Acrylica brand of upscale showers and bathtubs with whirlpool and air-massage systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Modern Fibreglass changed its name to MAAX (representing the first letters of its factories Modern, Archimede, and Acylica, as well as an "X" to denote future growth) and was listed on the Montreal Stock Exchange in 1987. In 1992 MAAX had a second public offering and was added to the Toronto Stock Exchange.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shortly after its second stock offering, MAAX instituted a series of acquisitions that lasted throughout the 1990s. In 1993 the company picked up its first US subsidiary through the purchase of Georgia-based Glastec. The next year MAAX added another US unit, Pearl Baths in Minnesota.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 MAAX made two more acquisitions -- Valley Fibrebath (British Columbia) and Hydro Swirl (Washington state). Its purchase of Bremen Glas (Indiana and Iowa) two years later gave MAAX access to the Midwest. A deal to supply Japan's S.G. Kai with complete bathroom kits (bath, toilet, sink, and plumbing parts) provided MAAX's first major overseas sales. Also in 1997 the company bought Manhattan Products Ltd., which boosted the MAAX product line of spas and medicine cabinets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year MAAX acquired five bathroom products manufacturers, including KSD Industries (shower doors and medicine cabinets) and Shostal Ltd. (adding the brands Spartan and Fasco).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company entered the kitchen cabinet market in 1999 by purchasing C.E. Cabinets (Novax Modular Group) and Imperial Woodcraft. In 2000 MAAX added its first European manufacturing operations by buying SaniNova B.V. in the Netherlands. Poulin handed over the CEO reins in July 2001 to André Héroux, who had served as COO for MAAX.

   In February 2002
   <company id="11470">

   replaced
   <company id="43614">
    Jacuzzi
   </company>
   with MAAX's Infiniti as the exclusive hot-tub brand sold at its stores. In October 2002 MAAX acquired Aker Plastics, a US manufacturer of fiberglass bathroom equipment. The company consolidated production in its spa sector the next year, completing the streamlining in December 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chairman and founder Placide Poulin sold his shareholdings and retired in 2004. After putting itself up for sale and setting up an independent committee to solicit and study possible offers, the company was acquired by certain companies formed by J.W. Childs Associates, LP; Borealis Private Equity Limited Partnership; Borealis (QLP) Private Equity Limited Partnership; and Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System in June 2004. The acquisition stipulated an exit strategy that would see the company sold back to the public within four to six years.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2004 the spa sector's products were withdrawn from home-improvement centers in the US, which affected sales and led the company to reorganize manufacturing in the sector, close a plant, and absorb the related non-recurring costs and a $12 million pre-tax write-down of goodwill in the sector.
  </p>
  <p>
   André Héroux left the company in late 2006; Paul Golden succeeded him as president and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 MAAX was acquired by Tricap Partners Ltd., a private-equity fund managed by Brookfield Asset Management. The company's name was subsequently changed to MAAX Bath Inc.
