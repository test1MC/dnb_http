   In fiscal 2015 (ended December), revenue fell 7.2% to £40.5 million due to a re-focusing on its high-margin business. Despite that, margins in the year still declined by 1.2% as the strengthening of the US dollar push up the cost of sales. The company was also hit hard by the collapse of Austin Reed in 2016: Berwin &amp; Berwin supplied 75% of the company's tailoring, and was a significant unsecured creditor when Austin Reed went into administration. The company wrote off over £800,000 of bad debts following the collapse. As a result, Berwin &amp; Berwin incurred a net loss to the tune of £1.4 million in 2015, versus a gain of £809,000 in 2014.
