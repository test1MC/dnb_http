   American Leather regularly rolls out new products to keep both its retail partners and customers coming back. In 2013 the company unveiled new sofas, chairs, and an ottoman/bench design at High Point Market. The newer collections were designed to offer consumers a classic and comfortable feel.

   Unlike other furniture makers, American Leather markets original designs by some of the industry's top international designers, including Rob Jones, Vladimir Kagan, Rick Lee, John Mascheroni, Michael Wolk, Goodman-Charlton, and Barbara and Robert Tiffany. These experts make their mark on small pieces, such as ottomans and individual chairs, to more substantial sectional collections.

   The furniture maker has positioned itself in the fabric upholstery market through its acquisition of John Charles Designs, a furniture manufacturer based in California. The 2008 deal included John Charles' fabric collection, furniture designs, and marketing materials. American Leather's purchase has enabled the company to expand its non-leather offerings.
