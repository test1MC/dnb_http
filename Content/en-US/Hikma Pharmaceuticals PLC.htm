   Hikma Pharmaceuticals seeks the right prescription for generic drug success. The company makes some 825 branded and unbranded generic drugs, which are available in a variety of forms and dosage strengths. About 40 product lines are distributed through licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies. Hikma's products are distributed to doctors, hospitals, and pharmacies in about 50 nations in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa through its network of sales representatives. The company conducts research and development in areas such as cardiology, anti-infective, neurology, and dermatology. Hikma Pharmaceuticals was founded in 1978 by the late Samih Darwazah.

  <p>
   Hikma's oral generics business makes and sells a variety of products, including controlled substances and antibiotics, in the US and has plants in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The company's sterile injectables segment makes about 165 medicines in fields including oncology, cardiovascular, infectious disease, and neurology at its manufacturing centers in Germany, Portugal, and the US; injectable products are sold in the US, Europe, and the MENA region. The branded segment makes about 500 generic and in-licensed drugs -- including anti-infectives, cardiovascular, neurology, and metabolic medicines -- that are made and sold in the MENA region.

  <p>
   The US has grown to become Hikma's largest geographic sales segment (more than half of total sales), followed by the MENA region (some 43% of sales). The company sells both unbranded and branded generic drugs in North America and Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hikma operates 27 manufacturing plants in 11 countries. Branded products are manufactured at its facilities in Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   A majority of Hikma's products are sold through wholesale distribution companies. Customers include private pharmacies and chain stores as well as large wholesalers, health systems, and government-backed agencies.

  <p>
   Revenue has been rising for the past five years; it rose 9% to $1.5 billion in 2014 on higher sales of injectables in the US. The Generics and Branded segments experienced declining sales that year, though.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income increased 31% to $278 million in 2014, thanks primarily to the higher revenue and the absence of expenses related to plant remediation. Cash flow from operations rose 26% to $425 million.

  <p>
   The company pursues growth by expanding its geographic reach and its product line, both through internal research efforts and through acquisitions. Hikma has been particularly focused on increasing sales of branded generic products (often licensed products) in the MENA region. The company is also focused on widening its presence in the US, where it pursues niche product opportunities in the highly competitive unbranded generics market. Emerging markets such as sub-Saharan Africa and the CIS countries are another area of focus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hikma has also expanded its global injectable drug operations by increasing manufacturing capacity and sales efforts. Through combined R&amp;D and acquisition efforts, the company launched 75 new products during 2015.

  <p>
   In 2015 the company agreed to buy
   <company id="100385">
    Roxane
   </company>
   , the generics operations of German drugmaker
   <company id="91087">
    Boehringer Ingelheim
   </company>
   , for $2.65 billion. That deal will make Hikma the US' sixth-largest generics supplier. To expand in Egypt, it also agreed to buy EIMC United Pharmaceuticals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hikma acquired Bedford Laboratories in mid-2014. Through that purchase, it gained a generic injectables manufacturing facility in Ohio.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Acquisitions have long served to support Hikma's growth goals. For example, in 2007 the company acquired Arab Pharmaceutical Manufacturing (APM) for $164 million and Alkan Pharma (now Hikma Egypt) for $60.5 million to expand in the Middle East. Hikma gained drugs to treat diabetes, cancers, and cardiovascular ailments through the acquisitions. It also purchased two German injectable oncology product makers (Ribosepharm and Thymoorgan) that year, which were merged to form the Hikma Germany division.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Hikma expanded its operations in the MENA core growth region by acquiring a majority stake in Moroccan pharmaceutical company Promopharm for $111 million, adding some 200 branded generic and in-licensed products. The company also purchased a Sudanese generic drugmaker, Elie Pharmaceuticals, that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, as part of its growth strategy in the injectables segment, in 2011 the company purchased
   <company id="10188">
    Baxter
   </company>
   's generic multi-source injectables business for about $112 million. The deal included chronic pain, anti-infective, and anti-nausea products, as well as a manufacturing facility in New Jersey and a warehouse and distribution center in Tennessee.
