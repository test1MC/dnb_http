   Michael Angelo's is riding two trends that are sweeping the food industry: the desire for fast, convenient, in-home preparation; and preference for products made from quality ingredients without artificial flavors or chemical preservatives. To this end, in 2013 it launched a new line of Italian flatbreads, including Pepperoni &amp; Salami Flatbread, Mediterranean Flatbread, Sausage &amp; Mushroom Flatbread and Margherita Flatbread, available at
