   VCNA is pursuing a number of measures to increase market share, among them, a revamp of its image. In 2014 VCNA selected integrated communications agency Waggener Edstrom Worldwide as agency of record in the US to promaote its brand.

   In 2013, the parent company announced plans to set up a new global purchasing and manufacturing organization to reduce complexity and costs by creating a more distinct governance, quality assurance and cost control throughout its entire value chain.

  <p>
   Volvo Car was first to make cars fitted with three-point safety belts; even before the 1959 rollout, safety has been fundamental to its brand identity. In 2011 VCNA launched the S60, a midsize sports sedan styled as "naughty", to take the brand to the next level and turnaround sales. Targeting the under-40-year-old driver looking for a reliable but edgy model, the company offered, for a limited time, goods, such as a virtual sedan, Volvo tire, steering wheel, or its logo, on the iPhone app, MyTown (created by
   <company id="155300">

   ).

  <p>
   After more than a year of negotiations,
   <company id="10597">
    Ford Motor

   completed its sale of Volvo Car Corporation to Geely in mid-2010. The $1.8 billion deal preserved Volvo Car's headquarters and manufacturing operations in Sweden and Belgium.

   purchased the Volvo automotive brand from Swedish truck maker
