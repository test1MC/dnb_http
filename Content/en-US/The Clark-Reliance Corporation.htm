  <p>
   Clark-Reliance traces its long history of innovation to 1884 when the newly formed Reliance Gauge Column Company of Cleveland produced and marketed the first alarm water column ever used by boiler operators. This device subsequently became standard equipment for major boiler makers across the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1968 Reliance Gauge Column Company merged with Clark Manufacturing Company (which had been founded in 1908), forming The Clark-Reliance Corporation.
