   Korbel produces champagnes and other wines from the fruit of its vineyards and the products of its winery and distillery that are situated along California's Russian River in western Sonoma County. Long noted for its premium champagne and less expensive versions of the sparkling wine, Korbel also bottles a Cabernet Sauvignon from grapes grown in the nearby Alexander Valley, and a Chardonnay. Korbel diversified by buying three wineries in Sonoma County. Korbel was founded in 1882 by activist and cigar-maker Francis Korbel and his two brothers. The family name means "goblet" in Czech. Korbel heirs sold the company in 1954 to Adolf Heck. Heck's son Gary still runs the privately-owned business.
