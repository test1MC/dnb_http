   To really know a person IRIS International doesn't look deep into their eyes. Instead, the company manufactures automated in-vitro diagnostic systems that analyze bodily fluids. Beginning with urinalysis technology, the company has expanded to include blood (hematology) and other fluids. Its Iris Diagnostics, division develops the iQ family of automated imaging systems used in urinalysis and microscopic analysis, as well as related consumables (reagents and test strips) and services. The Iris Sample Processing division markets centrifuges, small instruments, and laboratory supplies for specimen processing. The company was acquired by industrial and medical conglomerate
   <company id="10434">
    Danaher
   </company>
   in October 2012.

   In addition, the company is working on an automated urine bacteria screening device as an alternative to urine cultures, and it plans to expand into other fluid-based diagnostics, such as hematology (blood analysis).
