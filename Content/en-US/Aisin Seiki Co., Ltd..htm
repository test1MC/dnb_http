   Nothing stops Aisin Seiki from making its line of brake systems and powertrain components for cars. Aisin's main automotive business offers automotive-related products such as transmissions, brakes, and engine and car navigation systems. Its Life and Amenity business offers items for more comfortable living, with products that range from heating and cooling systems to toilets with jet sprays; well-care items include electric wheelchairs and reclining beds. The company has around 180 consolidated subsidiaries and companies worldwide. Separate business segments include Aisin AW Group, Aisin Seiki Group, Advics Group, and Aisin Takaoka Group.

  <p>
   Aisin Seiki operates through nearly 180 subsidiaries that are spread throughout four main segments. Aisin AW Group is its largest segment (37% of total sales in 2015) and makes automatic transmissions and car navigation systems. Aisin Seiki Group (36%) sells its automotive parts as well as its life and energy products. Advics Group is responsible for making brake components (17%), while Aisin Takaoka Group (6%) manufacturers the cart-iron parts for engines and brakes.

  <p>
   Aisin Seiki's revenues increased 5% from 2014 to 2015. The growth was due to increased sales from Aisin AW Group, Aisin Seiki Group, and Aisin Takaoka Group. The company's net income in 2015 declined mainly due to increased freight and packaging expenses coupled with a spike in selling, general, and administrative expenses.

  <p>
   Aisin Seiki is looking to diversify its customer mix by expanding production overseas to achieve a 50% ratio in the years ahead. It established new subsidiaries in Indonesia in 2014 and began constructing a new facility in Brazil also that year.

  <p>
   Aisin Seiki continues to make automotive components and systems, but it also focuses on increasing sales of main products such as transmissions, car navigation systems, and power sliding doors. The company's business segments have worked autonomously in the past; however, Aisin Seiki is working to combine and link its individual businesses, thus strengthening and maximizing the potential of the products and technologies that are cultivated by each company.

  <p>
   Aisin Seiki traces its roots to 1943 when Tokai Hikoki was founded to produce airplane engines for the Japanese war effort. After the war the company switched to manufacturing sewing machines and auto parts. Aisin Seiki took its present name in 1965 after Tokai Hikoki merged with Shinkawa Kogyo.
