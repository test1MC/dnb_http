  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates in the North and South America, Asia, and Europe. Its Air Pollution Control business has locations in the US as well as the Netherlands, Canada, Brazil, China, and India. The company provides custom metal fabrication services at its Kirk &amp; Blum Columbia, Tennessee and Louisville, Kentucky locations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013, sales to customers outside of the US, including export sales, accounted for 21% of CECO Environmental's revenues, the largest portion of which was to Canadian, Asian, and European customers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2014 CECO Environmental implemented an internal reorganization related to the integration of acquisitions, which resulted in three reportable segments: Air Pollution Control (Adwest Technologies, Inc., Duall Air and Odor Technologies, Busch International, Buell Energy Cyclones, Flex-Kleen Dust Collection Technologies, Fisher-Klosterman, Kirk &amp; Blum, and KB Duct); Energy (Aarding Thermal Acoustics, Effox-Flextor and AVC Specialists, Inc.; and Fluid Handling Filtration (Met-Pro Global Pump Solutions, Mefiag Filtration Solutions, Keystone Filtration Solutions, CECO Filters and Strobic Air Corporation).
  </p>
  <p>
   (The previous reporting structure was: Engineered Equipment Technology and Parts Group; Met-Pro Group; Contracting/Services Group; and Component Parts Group).
  </p>
  <p>
   The Air Pollution Control segments' services eliminate toxic emission fumes and volatile organic compounds from large-scale industrial processes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Fluid Handling Filtration segment provides product recovery and pollution control technologies for purification of air and liquids; fluid handling technologies for corrosive, abrasive and high temperature liquids; and filtration and purification technologies, which include proprietary water treatment chemicals and filter products for air and liquid filtration.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Energy segment provides air pollution and non-air pollution services to natural gas turbines and other energy-related equipment.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company serves a customer base of more than 5,000 customers in a range of industries, including power, municipalities, chemical, industrial manufacturing, refining, petrochemical, metals, minerals and mining, hospitals and universities.
  </p>
  <p>
   It sells and markets its products and services with its own direct sales force in the US, the Netherlands, Canada, India, Mexico, China, Singapore, and South America, in conjunction with outside sales representatives in North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East &amp; Africa, Asia, and India.

  <p>
   CECO Environmental's revenues increased by 46% in 2013, due to additional revenues derived from the newly formed Met-Pro Group, and as well as increased revenues from the Engineered Equipment Technology and Parts Group, and the Component Parts Group; partially offset by decreased revenues from the Contracting/Services Group (due to a decline in service work, delays, and cancellation of other jobs).
  </p>
  <p>
   The Engineered Equipment Technology and Parts Group's net sales increased thanks to the Adwest and Aarding acquisitions, and as well as increased revenues from Effox, FKI, and Buell; partially offset by lower Busch sales. Effox continued to have increased revenues due to utilities investing in their systems, while Busch was impacted by the lack of demand from the metals industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the Component Parts Group net sales grew thanks to increased demand for its component parts and clamp together duct products, as a result of many smaller contractors buying these products instead of making them in-house.
  </p>
  <p>
   CECO Environmental's net income decreased by 40% in 2013 due to higher acquisition and integration expenses; amortization and earn-out expenses as a result of the Aarding and Met-Pro acquisitions; and increased legal reserves related to the settlement of an employee union claim.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash provided by operating activities increased by $7 million in 2013 thanks to favorable net working capital improvements, which more than offset the reduction in net income.
  </p>

  <p>
   CECO's growth strategy aims to increase revenues, profitability and market position in both the US and abroad (including projects in China, India, Latin America, Europe and the Middle East). The company aims to expand its customer base, enter new end markets, and further penetrate existing end markets; develop innovative solutions; maintain strong customer focus; and pursue selective acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus on bringing expanded air pollution control technology products to the growing China market, in 2014 CECO Environmental signed a sales cooperation agreement with Jiangsu Renhe Environmental Equipments Company., Ltd.

  <p>
   CECO Environmental in 2013 acquired Adwest Technologies, a California-based firm that makes, installs, and services regenerative thermal oxidizers used in air pollution abatement solutions, for $4 million. In 2013 it also purchased
   <company id="12147">
    Met-Pro Corporation
   </company>
   , a top global provider of product recovery, pollution control, and fluid handling and filtration systems, for $104 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company also acquired Netherlands-based Aarding Thermal Acoustics B.V., for $24 million. The Aarding deal increased CECO Environmental's global access to natural gas turbine exhaust systems and silencer applications, and to lead its expanding global natural gas business including the Flextor division which provides complementary and integrated engineered solutions to those of Aarding. Aarding was then integrated into the company's Energy Segment.
