   Forget the outer planets, the earth has its own gaseous giant in the form of L'Air Liquide. Also known as Air Liquide, the French company jockeys with
   <company id="91155">
    Linde
   </company>
   to be the world's largest industrial gas supplier. Its gases include argon, carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. Its industrial gases are used in the production processes of almost every major market, while medical gases such as oxygen are used by hospitals and other healthcare providers. Air Liquide has more than a hundred subsidiaries in 80 countries, with a clear strength in Europe. The company operates in the US through Air Liquide USA. In 2016 it bought US rival
   <company id="10044">
    Airgas
   </company>
   for $13.4 billion.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company makes the vast majority of its money - some 90% - from its Gases &amp; Services segment. The segment comprises four activities, Large Industries (32% of total revenue), Industrial Merchant (32%), Healthcare (17%) and Electronics (9%). It also runs three other divisions (Engineering and Construction, Global Markets &amp; Technologies and Other activities) that amount to around a combined 10% of revenue.
  </p>
        <p>
   Large Industries provides companies in the metal, chemistry, refining and energy sectors with industrial gases, including oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, argon and steam. It operates 355 air separation units and 47 hydrogen production units.
  </p>
        <p>
   Through its Industrial Merchant segment, Air Liquide offers industrial and specialty gases, application technologies and related services to its more-than 1 million customers.
  </p>
        <p>
   Air Liquide's Healthcare gases find innumerable uses in the healthcare industry, including in anaesthesia, treatment for acute hypertension and acute hypoxia, and hygiene.
  </p>
        <p>
   The Electronics segments supplies gases to the electronics industry for use in semiconductors, solar cells, and LED technologies for flat-panel displays, among other things.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Air Liquide operates in some 80 countries across the globe, but has a strong focus on Europe, where it generates around 46% of revenue. The Americas and the Asia-Pacific region both bring in around 25% each.

        </p>
        <p>
   Air Liquide grew revenue by 7% in 2015 to €16.4 billion. A large part of this came from positive exchange rate effects, but an increase in hydrogen sales, and sales of advanced materials to Japan, China and Taiwan, also contributed strongly to growth. On the downside, revenue from the Industrial Merchant segment fell 1.3% amid a slowdown in demand for oil services.
  </p>
        <p>
   Net profit rose in 2015 by 5% to €1.8 billion, broadly in line with the increase in earnings.

        <p>
   Cash flow from operating activities was flat on prior year at €2.8 billion

        <p>
   Like the gases it sells, Air Liquide want expand into all available space. The company's purchase of US firm Airgas for $13.4 billion, completed in early 2016, makes it the largest player in North America, to sit alongside its #1 position in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia-Pacific region. The addition of Airgas' annual revenue of around €4.8 billion will take Air Liquide's annual earnings past €20 billion and beyond that of its rival, Linde. It hoped the acquisition will provide a springboard for growth and generate synergies worth $300 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   The acquisition of Airgas, which came with a strong e-commerce offering, also complements Air Liquide's digital strategy. Further, in 2015 Air Liquide made its first investment in digital, in the shape of 'Internet of Things' company Sigfox. The company develops specialized wireless networks to connect low-energy devices like electricity meters and smartwatches, and Air Liquide hope Sigfox's products will improve supply chains by monitoring machines' performance and anticipating breakdowns.
  </p>
        <p>
   Air Liquide's international expansion continued apace in 2015, with deals signed in a number of significant emerging markets. These include contracts signed in South Africa with energy and chemical company Sasol for the construction of the world's largest oxygen production site; in China in the energy and copper sectors; in the Asia-Pacific region for the supply of ultra-pure nitrogen for the semiconductor industry; and in Colombia, with Latin America's biggest beverage supplier.

        <p>
   Just after the turn of the century, French chemist Georges Claude discovered a method for liquefying acetylene. He obtained financing from two acquaintances, Paul Delorme and Frederic Gallier, and L'Air Liquide (Air Liquide) was incorporated in 1902. Delorme became president of the company and served in that capacity until 1945.
  </p>
        <p>
   After a few bumpy years, the company expanded, opening plants in Belgium and Brazil in 1906. Claude applied for a patent for neon tubes in 1907, and the company began producing oxygen in 1908. Before WWI Air Liquide had plants in Canada, Japan, Spain, and Sweden. Between the wars the company continued to expand, opening plants in Greece, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Portugal. After WWII Claude was accused of collaborating with the Nazis on the development of the infamous V-1 and V-2 "buzz bombs." A French court sentenced him to life in prison, but he was released in 1950.
  </p>
        <p>
   Despite sales declines in the 1960s, Paul Delorme's son Jean resisted the gas industry's trend toward diversification, choosing instead to sell the company's less profitable units. In 1969 the company opened for business in the US. Air Liquide's US operations grew and it had about a 14% market share in 1986. That year it acquired Texas-based Big Three Industries in a $1.6 billion deal, becoming the second-largest industrial gas producer in the US.
  </p>
        <p>
   The recession of the early 1990s prompted cost-cutting and a restructuring that decentralized decision making to regional groups. Also, the company and the industry showed increased interest in small on-site production units specially designed for individual customers. In 1996 two large iron and steel contracts in Poland garnered a foothold there. In 1999 Air Liquide and
   <company id="10042">
    Air Products and Chemicals
   </company>
   agreed to jointly take over UK-based British Oxygen Corporation (
   <company id="90067">
    BOC
   </company>
   ) in an $11.2 billion deal. Air Liquide had purchased BOC's operations in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany earlier that year.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2000 Air Liquide and Air Products and Chemicals shelved their plan to acquire BOC when it became clear that the deal could not gain approval by the US Federal Trade Commission because of antitrust concerns. The following year Air Liquide spurned acquisition offers by French utilities group
   <company id="90853">
    Suez
   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   Air Liquide took advantage of the break-up of
   <company id="92102">
    Messer Griesheim
   </company>
   in 2004, buying a large portion of that company's operations -- in Germany, the UK, and the
   <company id="107348">
    US
   </company>
   -- for more than $3 billion. Analysts deemed the price a bit high, but Air Liquide wanted to act before rivals
   <company id="15758">
    Praxair
   </company>
   and Air Products and Chemicals jumped into the fray. Praxair was able to benefit from the Messer Griesheim firesale in any event. Late in the year Air Liquide sold some of its German assets to Praxair for about $650 million; the sale was mandated to satisfy antitrust and regulatory restrictions.
