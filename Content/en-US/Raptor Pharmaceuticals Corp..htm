   Raptor Pharmaceuticals is on the hunt for rare disease cures. The commercial-stage biopharmaceutical specializes in developing small molecule therapies to treat orphan diseases. It has two products on the market -- PROCYSBI (for the management of nephropathic cystinosis, approved in Europe) and QUINSAIR (for the management of chronic pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis patients, also approved in Europe). The PROCYSBI molecule RP103 also holds US orphan drug designation for the treatment of Huntington's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.

   Horizon agreed to purchase Raptor Pharmaceuticals in mid-2016 in a move to strengthen its orphan disease program. The deal also provided Horizon with a platform to expand in Europe and other international markets.

   Raptor has additional development programs in clinical and pre-clinical stages. For example, its Convivia candidate is in phase 2 development to manage an inherited metabolic disorder that is rampant in East Asia. It has a licensing agreement with Uni Pharma to develop and commercialize Convivia in Taiwan. Additional pipeline treatments target cancer and other diseases.
