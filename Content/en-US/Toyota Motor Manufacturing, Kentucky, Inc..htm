    Toyota
   </company>
   's largest manufacturing facility outside of Japan, makes the Toyota Camry (the #1 choice with American consumers), Avalon, and Venza for the North American market. To the red of the sun and the blue of the grass, TMMK adds green to the mix with its production of the Camry Hybrid to satisfy the hemisphere's appetite for alternative fueled vehicles. Other products manufactured include 4 cylinder and V6 engines, and powertrain components. TMMK, which can produce 550,000 engines and vehicles per year, rolled its first complete car off its assembly line in 1990.

   Toyata's North American revenue increased in fiscal 2013. In North America, vehicle unit sales increased by 597 thousand vehicles compared with the prior fiscal year due mainly to the market recovering in a steady manner and strong sales of Corolla, Camry, and other car models in fiscal 2013.
