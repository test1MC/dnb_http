   Motorola Mobility was created when Motorola, which made semiconductors, wireless phones, and other devices, broke up in 2010. After a short time on its own, Motorola Mobility was bought in 2011 for $12.5 billion by Google, which wanted to pair phone hardware with its Android operating system. Deciding that wasn't the way to go, Google sold the phone unit to Lenovo in late 2014.
