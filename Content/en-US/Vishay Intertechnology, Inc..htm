   Vishay Intertechnology is aggressive when it comes to passives. The company is one of the top makers of passive electronic components, such as inductors, capacitors, and resistors, in the world. It is also a leader in the market for discrete semiconductor components, including diodes, infrared optoelectronic components, and MOSFETs (metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors) which function as solid-state switches in power control applications. Vishay's components are used in everything from hybrid cars to spacecraft to wireless phones and laptops. The company operates worldwide and gets most of its sales from customers outside the US.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Vishay operates in five reporting segments: MOSFETs, Diodes, Optoelectronic Components, Resistors and Inductors, and Capacitors. Resistors and inductors generate 31% of the company's sales, followed by Diodes, 23%, MOSFETs, 19%, Capacitors, 15%, and Optoelectronic Components, 12%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates runs its own manufacturing operations with some 50 plants around the world. It has placed the manufacturing facilities in low cost countries near customers.
  </p>

  <p>
   Customers in the Asia-Pacific region account for 40% of Vishay's sales while customers in Europe, led by those in Germany, account for 35%. The company gets about a quarter of its sales from customers in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's primary production facilities are in the US, Europe (Germany, France, and the Czech Republic), Israel, and Asia (China, Taiwan, India, and Malaysia). It also has manufacturing plants in Austria, the Dominican Republic, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Mexico, The Netherlands, Portugal, and the Philippines. The company also has design centers throughout the world.

  <p>
   More than half of Vishay's sales are made through distributors. Original equipment makers (OEMs) account for about 39% with contract manufacturers generating the rest.

   Vishay posted a 7% drop in revenue and a net loss for 2015. The company reported lower revenue in all its product line, save for optoelectronics, which increased 8%. Sales in capacitors were hurt by changes in the energy sector with the discontinuation of government spending for renewable energy projects and reduced spending by oil and gas companies. Vishay also took a hit when it brought money from overseas sales back to the US, triggering a tax bill that was some $133 million higher in 2015. A loss of $108 million in 2015 was the result, compared to a $117 million profit in 2014. Cash flow from operations decreased to $245 million in 2015 from $297 million the year before.

  <p>
   Vishay has made acquisitions to expand its product line and customer base.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also expanded its sale force, particularly in China, in 2014 with field engineers who can use their expertise to identify and support customers in industrial markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Vishay has made adjustments to headcount and manufacturing capacity that resulted in restructuring costs of $20 million in 2014. It also transferred production of some diode products for lower labor costs in one case and from the consolidation of manufacturing locations in another. When demand slackens, the company reduces hours and limits the use of subcontractors and foundries.

  <p>
   Vishay made two acquisitions of $21 million each in 2014 to close gaps in its product line. The acquisition of Holy Stone Polytech brought that company's polymer tantalum capacitor technology to Vishay. With the acquisition of Capella, a Taiwan-based fables IC design company, Vishay obtained the capability to design ICs for infrared sensors, strengthening Vishay's optoelectronics business, especially in optical sensors.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 it paid about $23 million for specialty resistor manufacturer MCB Industrie. The prior year Vishay bought HiRel Systems for about $85 million to boost its magnetic products business. HiRel specialized in transformers, inductors, coils, and power conversion products used in aerospace, aviation, medical, military, renewable energy, and test and measurement applications.

  <p>
   Felix Zandman, Poland native and Holocaust survivor, earned his doctorate in physics at the Sorbonne. As a student, Zandman developed PhotoStress, a plastic coating that revolutionized stress testing of railcars and airplane wings. In the mid-1950s Zandman worked for the Budd Co., a Philadelphia-based steelmaker. During that period he developed a breakthrough resistor whose performance wasn't affected by temperature.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1962 Zandman borrowed $200,000 from cousin Alfred Slaner, the creator of nylon support hose, to start Vishay, which was named for the family's ancestral village in Lithuania. Zandman and associate James Starr made significant developments in resistors. Vishay opened its first plant in Israel in 1969 and went public in 1974. By the early 1980s it was a world leader in ultraprecise resistors and resistive sensors.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company and British financiers Mezzanine Capital formed a joint venture in 1985 to buy Dale Electronics, a US maker of resistors whose parent company, Lionel, had filed for bankruptcy. Dale was nearly three times Vishay's size. Vishay soon added Draloric Electronic (1987, Germany) and Sfernice (1988, France). The company bought Mezzanine's half of Dale in 1988.
