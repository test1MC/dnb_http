   This body builder wants to pump up your chassis. Miller Industries makes bodies for light- and heavy-duty wreckers, along with car carriers and multi-vehicle trailers. It serves as the official recovery team at some of the

   races (including Talladega), as well as the Indy 500 races. Miller makes its recovery and towing vehicles at plants in the US and Europe. Its multi-vehicle transport trailers can carry as many as eight vehicles and loads up to 75 tons. Miller Industries' US brand names include Century, Challenger, Champion, Chevron, Eagle, Holmes, Titan, and Vulcan. The company's European brands are Jige (France) and Boniface (UK). Miller and rival

   dominate the US market for wrecker bodies.

   The company has six manufacturing facilities in France, the UK, and the US. These facilities reside in Ooltewah (Chattanooga), Tennessee; Hermitage, Pennsylvania; Mercer, Pennsylvania; and Greeneville, Tennessee. It also has manufacturing operations at two facilities located in the Lorraine region of France and manufacturing operations in Norfolk, England. North America accounted for 86% of Miller's revenue in 2015.

   Professional wrecker operators, repossession, and salvage companies comprise the light-duty wrecker market. Commercial vehicle operators and professional wreckers are served by the company's heavy-duty vehicles.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company creates vehicles by bending steel and aluminum and welding the parts together to create a frame; hydraulic cylinders, pumps, winches, and valves are attached to complete the carrier or wrecker body. The bodies are then attached to truck chassis made by third-party manufacturers such as Kenworth (a brand belonging to
   <company id="14354">
    PACCAR
   </company>
   ), which is Miller's primary provider of truck chassis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Miller has developed a wrecker that allows for damage-free towing of newer aerodynamic vehicles that are made of composite or lighter weight materials. The company boasts innovative technology which includes underlift parallel linkage and L-arms and the Vulcan "scoop" -- these systems offer better lift-and-carry options that also protect cargo.

  <p>
   Miller experienced historic revenue growth in 2015, when revenues peaked at a record-setting $541 million. Profits also spiked by 7% to reach $16 million in 2015, and cash flow from operations skyrocketed by 102% during the year. The unprecedented growth for 2015 was fueled by a 17% rise in North American sales due to higher production levels based on the continued recovery of economic conditions and improving consumer sentiment.

  <p>
   The company's involvement with professional racing increases the exposure of Miller's products and supports sales and marketing efforts. Additionally, the company focuses on domestic and international trade shows where it partners with its independent distributors in promotions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Miller grows its operations by enhancing its production capacity. It continues to expand its Pennsylvania manufacturing facility, and it began to enhance the facilities at its Ooltewah, Tennessee; and Greeneville, Tennessee plants during 2016 and beyond.

  <p>
   Headed by William Miller, the Miller Group (which owned Challenger Wrecker and Holmes International) acquired the wrecking operations of Century Holdings in 1990 and formed the basis for Miller Industries. However, Miller Industries wasn't officially created until 1994, when the Miller Group placed all of its wrecking and towing businesses under that nameplate. The company went public in 1995.
