   Talking trash (and transporting it) is big business at McNeilus Companies. The company manufactures garbage trucks (front, side, and rear loaders), concrete mixers, and related heavy duty commercial construction vehicles and components. McNeilus also builds and erects concrete batch plants (machinery used to store and load concrete into concrete trucks) such as conveyors, drums, dust collectors, material storage silos and bins, rollers, and water systems. The lineup is sold through a network of dealers to waste haulers and ready-mix companies, and mining and construction businesses in the US and abroad. McNeilus Companies operates as a subsidiary of truck and vehicle maker
