   Sagent Pharmaceuticals is imbued with a restorative spirit. Through its subsidiaries, Sagent develops and markets a range of generic injectable products used by US hospitals and other health care organizations. Its products -- which include anti-infection drugs and oncology and critical-care treatments used for anesthesia or to stabilize cardiac conditions -- consist of 30 ready-to-use prefilled syringes, single and multiple-dose vials, and premixed bags. Sagent develops its products using active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and finished drugs supplied by partner pharmaceutical firms. Japanese generics firm Nichi-Iko Pharmaceutical bought Sagent for some $736 million in mid-2016.

  <p>
   Sagent, which had gone public in 2011, was acquired by Nichi-Iko Pharmaceutical, which wanted to expand into the US (and to provide a platform for its biosimilar platform). It also created a larger generics firm with little overlap in products.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Sagent's largest product segment is anti-infectives (40% of sales in 2015), followed by critical-care (38%) and oncology treatments (22%). Nearly all of Sagent's product revenues come from the US market. Several of Sagent's products are a result of a joint venture with manufacturer Strides Arcolab; other supply partners include Gland Pharma and Dobofar.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prior to March 2016, the company operated in two segments: Sagent US (90% of sales, this segment included the US operations and the Sagent China Pharmaceuticals, or SCP, manufacturing facility) and Omega (Canada). However, Sagent divested the SCP facility and began integrating the Canadian operations with the US business. The company now operates in a single reportable segment.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The US accounts for 90% of Sagent's revenue, and Canada accounts for the rest.

   The company employs a direct sales force to market its products, but it uses a third-party logistics manager (
   <company id="99386">
    DDN
   </company>
   ) to administer the warehousing and shipping of its products from DDN's facility in Tennessee. Sales to wholesale drug distributors

   , and
   <company id="10977">
    McKesson
   </company>
   account for about 80% of revenues; end users who receive the Sagent products via wholesalers include independent hospitals and group purchasing organizations (GPOs) such as

    Vizient
   </company>
   and
   <company id="108785">
    HealthTrust
   </company>
   . In 2015, the five largest GPOs accounted for 35% of the Sagent US segment's net contract revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other customers include specialty distributors and a variety of end-user clients.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company spent $1.2 million on direct advertising and promotion in 2015, up from $1.1 million in 2014 and $0.8 million in 2013.

  <p>
   Sagent's revenue has grown over the past five years. It rose 10% to $318 million in 2015 thanks to growth across both segments. The Omega segment increased by more than 250% that year, the first full year after Sagent acquired pharmaceutical firm Omega. The Sagent US revenue rose 3% in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   After seeing a rise in net income over the past few years, Sagent had a net loss of $22 million in 2015 (versus net income of $40 million in 2014). The decline was driven by higher selling, general, and administrative expenses and employee-related stock compensation expenses, as well as management transition costs due to the retirement of the company's founder and CEO and the resignation of its president. Sagent also had a $5 million legal settlement that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations fell for the second year in a row in 2015. The company had a cash outflow of $7 million due to the net loss and an increase in cash used in inventories.

  <p>
   Sagent has an extensive network of business partners around the world to help it with product development, API sourcing, and finished product manufacturing. At the end of 2015, it had about 50 partners in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company sold its SCP manufacturing facility in China for $0.5 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sagent and Actavis (now
   <company id="12311">
    Allergan
   </company>
   ) terminated their manufacturing and supply agreement at the end of 2015.

   Founded in 2006, Sagent went public through an IPO in 2011. The company changed its name from Sagent Holding to Sagent Pharmaceuticals and reincorporated from the Cayman Islands to the US shortly after its stock began trading.
