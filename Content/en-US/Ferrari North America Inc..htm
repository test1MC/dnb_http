   . Ferrari North America is Ferrari's exclusive business arm for vehicle imports, marketing, sales, and dealerships crossing North, Central, and South America. Its exotic models, as expensive as they are fast, include the California T, 458 Speciale, F12berlinetta, FF, 458 Italia and 458 Spider. Although coupe-size in operations compared with corporate goliaths like

   and
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   , Ferrari North America is on a roll. Even in the face of an economic slow down, demand exceeds supply. It continues to build fewer cars than ordered, yet add new dealerships, notably in Florida, its third largest market.

  <p>
   Ferrari North America is single-minded about the "four P's" of marketing its prancing brand in the Americas. Product: Called automotive-art, the company is passionate about delivering on its lineup's racing performance and design. Counterfeits are prosecuted. Ferrari also offers customers and collectors factory-run restoration and certification services. A Ferrari model's history and replacement parts can be verified, avoiding knock-off purchases. Price: Products are priced for an enthusiasts-only (with deep pockets) club. New models start at more than $200,000, and pre-owned actually appreciate in value. Moreover, consumers ready to purchase typically have to wait; production volumes are deliberately kept low. This being so, to ensure a profit for Ferrari North America, its parent typically allots at least 30% of its annual production to North America. Promotion: The company's participation in motorsports, such as the American Le Mans and Ferrari Challenge series, has been key to building the Ferrari image of power, style, and exclusive ownership. Ferrari North America provides a driving school for its owners, too, at the Circuit Mont-Tremblant racetrack, Quebec. Place: Dealerships undergo near-constant renovation.
