   Don't worry, you'll only feel a slight prick if Becton, Dickinson (BD) is at work. The company's BD Medical segment is one of the top global manufacturers of syringes and other injection and infusion devices. BD Medical also makes IV catheters and syringes, pre-fillable drug delivery systems, self-injection devices for diabetes patients, and related supplies such as anesthesia trays and sharps disposal systems. The BD Life Sciences segment makes products for the safe collection and transportation of diagnostic specimens; it also makes instruments and reagent systems that detect cancers, infectious diseases, and health care associated infections (HAIs).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's larger operating segment is BD Medical, which accounts for some 70% of total revenue. BD Life Sciences brings in the rest of BD's revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales of safety devices have experienced positive growth in recent years, especially in international markets. Other areas contributing to BD Medical's operations include sales of pre-filled syringes and diabetic pen needles.
  </p>
  <p>
   BD Life Sciences operates in three key areas: pre-analytical systems, diagnostic systems, and biosciences. Its products include safety-engineered equipment for the collection of blood, automated diagnostic platforms, and cell analysis equipment.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   BD has manufacturing, marketing, and warehousing operations in about 50 countries in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. It serves more than 190 countries globally.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though the company is working to increase international sales (especially in emerging markets), the US remains its largest segment accounting for about 55% of sales. The European segment, which includes operations in Africa and the Middle East, is BD's second-largest operating region, accounting for about 25% of revenues.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   BD's customers include entities in health care (including hospitals and pharmacies), drug development, medical research (including academic and government labs), clinical research (such as reference labs and blood banks), and agricultural or food analysis. The company uses a direct sales force and independent representatives to market and distribute its products in the US and abroad. In the US, products are sold primarily to distributors, who then resell to end-users.

  <p>
   Revenue has been rising for the past five years. In fiscal 2016 (ended September), revenue increased 21% to $12.5 billion. This growth was due to higher sales of BD Medical products, including safety-engineered products and diabetic pen needles. The addition of sales from the newly acquired
   <company id="161214">
    CareFusion
   </company>
   also drove up revenues. The BD Life Sciences segment, remained relatively flat that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income, on the other hand, has been fluctuating for the past few years. In fiscal 2016, net income rose 40% to $976 million; increased revenue was a leading factor in this growth, as was the reduction of acquisition, administrative, and selling costs related to the 2015 purchase of CareFusion.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's capital expenditures are largely dedicated to geographic expansion and improving manufacturing capabilities. In fiscal 2016 BD had capital expenditures of $693 million, versus $596 million in 2015 and $592 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   BD is focused on expanding by investing in R&amp;D, with a focus on its core medical technology segments (it spent $828 million on R&amp;D in 2016, compared to $632 million in 2015). To that end, in 2016 it opened a new diabetes care facility housing R&amp;D and manufacturing operations in Massachusetts. It also began investing some $100 million in a Nebraska facility to expand its capacity for insulin syringe manufacturing. However, later that year the company announced plans to shutter a North Carolina manufacturing facility acquired as part of the 2015 purchase of
   <company id="161214">
    CareFusion
   </company>
   . It is moving that site's activities to facilities in Mexico and Utah.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other strategic areas of focus include geographic expansion and the promotion of new products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through the BD Medical unit, BD has been cashing in on the increased emphasis on safety in health care delivery by introducing a number of safety-engineered devices that prevent accidental needle sticks, and thus exposure to infected blood. BD Life Sciences is doing the same, growing through sales of its safety-engineered blood collection equipment, including the BD Vacutainer system.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to improving safety, BD is working to improve drug delivery methods, increasing the speed of disease diagnosis, and advancing pharmaceutical research techniques. The company supplements its internal R&amp;D programs by forming partnerships and conducting acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   BD has also divested non-core operations in recent years to focus its resources its faster growing operations. In early 2015 it sold prescription unit BD Rx (which included a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in North Carolina) to a division of
   <company id="102670">
    Fresenius
   </company>
   for an undisclosed amount. The two companies also signed a 10-year agreement through which Fresenius Kabi USA will provide BD with a portfolio of intravenous fluids.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 BD agreed to sell 50.1% of its Respiratory Solutions unit (another non-core operation) to
   <company id="40358">
    Apax
   </company>
   -advised funds; the partners will form a new joint venture that will include the Ventilation, Respiratory Diagnostics, Vital Signs, and Air
   <em>
    Life
   </em>
   businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year, BD received
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval for its Totalys MultiProcessor and Totalys SlidePrep instruments, which help automate slide preparation, imaging, and review in the screening for cervical cancer. It received FDA approval and European CE marking for its Vacutainer UltraTouch Push Button Blood Collection Set. Additionally, the company introduced its FacSymphony system, a novel cell analyzer which measures up to 50 characteristics of a single cell.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 BD Life Sciences acquired Cellular Research, a biotechnology R&amp;D startup specializing in single-cell genomic analysis. The deal aligned with BD's broader genomics strategy which includes plans to launch such products as an automated next-generation sequencing library prep system.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2015, BD acquired CRISI Medical Systems (a specialist in improving the safety of IV-injected medicines) and Surgical Site Solutions (which makes the ClipVac pre-surgical hair removal tool).
  </p>
  <p>
   As a way to address hospitals' need for an end-to-end medication management system, BD in 2015 purchased smart medical device maker
   <company id="161214">
    CareFusion
   </company>
   . The move faced tough scrutiny from shareholders since the $12.2 billion price wasn't much of a premium over the stock price, and from government officials since CareFusion recently paid $40.1 to settle charges that it promoted off-label prescriptions of its products and paid off physicians to push its wares. In 2016 BD sold CareFusion's vertebral compression fracture product portfolio to

  <p>
   Maxwell Becton and Fairleigh Dickinson established a medical supply firm in New York in 1897. In 1907 the company moved to New Jersey and became one of the first US firms to make hypodermic needles.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWI, Becton, Dickinson (BD) made all-glass syringes and introduced the cotton elastic bandage. After the war, its researchers designed an improved stethoscope and created specialized hypodermic needles. The company supplied medical equipment to the armed forces during WWII. Becton and Dickinson helped establish Fairleigh Dickinson Junior College (now Fairleigh Dickinson University) in 1942. The company continued to develop products such as the Vacutainer blood-collection apparatus, its first medical laboratory aid.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the deaths of Dickinson (1948) and Becton (1951), their respective sons, Fairleigh Jr. and Henry, took over. The company introduced disposable hypodermic syringes in 1961. BD went public in 1963 to raise money for new expansion. In the 1960s the company opened plants in Brazil, Canada, France, and Ireland and climbed aboard the conglomeration bandwagon by diversifying into such businesses as industrial gloves (Edmont, 1966) and computer systems (Spear, 1968). BD also went on a major acquisition spree in its core fields during the 1960s and 1970s, buying more than 25 medical supply, testing, and lab companies by 1980.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wesley Howe, successor to Fairleigh Dickinson Jr., expanded the company's foreign sales in the 1970s. Howe thwarted a takeover by the diversifying oil giant Sun Company (now Sunoco) in 1978 and began to sell BD's non-medical businesses in 1983, ending with the 1989 sale of Edmont. Acquisitions, including Deseret Medical (IV catheters, surgical gloves and masks; 1986), sharpened BD's focus on medical and surgical supplies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1990s BD formed a number of alliances and ventures, including a 1991 agreement to make and market Baxter International's InterLink needleless injection system, which reduces the risk of accidental needle sticks, and a 1993 joint venture with NeXagen (now part of Gilead Sciences) to make and market in vitro diagnostics. As tuberculosis reemerged in the US as a serious health threat, the firm improved its TB-detection and drug-resistance test systems, which cut testing time from as much as seven weeks to less than two.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 BD introduced GlucoWatch (a glucose monitoring device developed by Cygnus), and acquired the diagnostic business and brand name of MicroProbe (now Epoch Pharmaceuticals).
  </p>
  <p>
   Previously known on Wall Street as a homely company that focused on cutting costs, BD changed its image with a string of acquisitions beginning in 1997. The firm acquired PharMingen (biomedical research reagents) and Difco Laboratories (microbiology media), which broadened its product lines. BD also collaborated with Nanogen on diagnosis products for infectious disease.
