   Somehow all those

   products have to get from factories to the sales floor, and that's where Access Business Group (ABG) comes in. The company manufactures and distributes cosmetics, nutritional supplements, home care, and personal care products for its sister company, Amway. (Both companies are units of
   <company id="40031">
    Alticor
   </company>
   .) It also offers contract manufacturing services for third-party consumer goods companies, but to a lesser extent. Other offerings include product packaging services, as well as catalog and direct mail printing services. In addition, the company operates R&amp;D labs that develop and test products for Amway.

   Amway announced in 2012 it was investing nearly $180 million to expand manufacturing and processing capacity to meet growing global demand for its NUTRILITE brand of vitamin, mineral, and dietary supplements. The investment includes a new $81 million nutrition plant at the company's Spaulding Avenue site in Ada, Michigan, near Amway's headquarters. In support of this initiative, the Michigan government has approved a $1.6 million incentive from a fund to support construction of this nutrition products manufacturing facility for ABG.
