        <p>
   Founded in 1905, Royal Appliance Mfg. Co. is one of the world's oldest manufacturers of vacuum cleaners. The company produced the world's first hand-held vacuum, the Royal Prince, in 1937.
  </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" />

        <p>
   Founded in Cleveland as the P.A. Geier Company in 1905, the company mainly made Royal metal vacuum cleaners, but it also made mixers, hair dryers, and washing machines. It introduced the first handheld vacuum, the Royal Prince, in 1937. Salvaged from bankruptcy in 1953 by the Schott family, the company was renamed Royal Appliance Mfg. and sold to a group of employees, led by Stanley Erbor, the next year.
  </p>
        <p>
   Royal's expensive metal vacuums eventually dimmed in popularity as other companies unveiled lightweight plastic models, including Black &amp; Decker's 1979 debut of the Dustbuster. In 1981 an investment group headed by John Balch bought Royal from Erbor's estate for about $4.5 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   Sales exploded three years later when it released an inexpensive bright red plastic version of the Prince, called the Dirt Devil Hand Vac. By 1990 Royal had introduced upright Dirt Devils and had begun selling its products overseas. The company went public the following year.
  </p>
        <p>
   John Rochon's Richmont Capital Partners began accumulating a stake in Royal in 1993. It lost money that year and again in 1995 when its Hand Vac lost sales to a number of competitors. Balch was forced out of the company in 1995 after a clash with Rochon, and finance chief Michael Merriman was elevated to CEO.
  </p>
        <p>
   By the end of 1995, Royal had sold off its money-draining European units. A turnaround plan launched in 1996 included direct-response television, a minimum of three new product launches per year, and a high-visibility ad campaign. New products unveiled that year included the combination broom and vacuum Broom Vac, the Ultra Hand Vac, and the Ultra MVP Upright.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1997 an ad featuring 10-years-dead Fred Astaire dancing with a Dirt Devil debuted during the Super Bowl. Following an industry trend, the company introduced its first bagless model, the Swivel Glide Vision, in 1998. Also in 1998, continuing a campaign to boost its stock price, Royal announced it would repurchase 20% of its outstanding shares.
  </p>
        <p>
   Royal continued to expand its product line in 1999 with innovative vacuums including the Vision bagless upright, Power Stick lightweight vacuum, and the Easy Steamer shampooer. In 2000 the company announced another stock repurchase plan, this time for 25% of its outstanding shares.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2001 Royal introduced its new premium Devil Platinum Force line, which includes a bagless hand-held vacuum cleaner, a bagless upright vacuum cleaner, and an upright carpet extractor. The same year Royal's Privacy Technologies subsidiary introduced the TeleZapper -- a telephone attachment that helps block unwanted telemarketing calls and removes consumers' phone numbers from the telemarketers' computerized dialing lists.
  </p>
        <p>
   In December 2002 Royal Appliance entered into a cross license agreement with Matsushita Home Appliances (now
   <company id="41873">
    Panasonic Corp
   </company>
   .) with respect to certain patents and property rights for its bagless upright vacuum cleaner products. In April 2003 Royal Appliance was acquired by Hong Kong's Techtronic Industries for about $105 million in cash.
