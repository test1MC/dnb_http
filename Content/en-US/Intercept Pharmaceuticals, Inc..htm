   Intercept Pharmaceuticals looks to cut liver disease off at the pass. A biopharmaceutical company, Intercept Pharmaceuticals is developing, and seeking to commercialize, therapies to treat chronic liver disease. Its lead product candidate, obeticholic acid (OCA), is being developed to treat primary biliary cirrhosis, an autoimmune liver disease that can lead to liver failure and death. OCA is currently in late-stage clinical development. Intercept also has other candidates in its pipeline in earlier stages of development, including treatments for other forms of cirrhosis, portal hypertension (pressure in a key vein leading to the liver), fibrosis, and Type 2 diabetes. Intercept went public in 2012.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 IPO.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company plans to use a portion of the $75 million in IPO proceeds to fund the continued clinical development of OCA and OCA's regulatory approval process. It would also reserve some funds for general corporate purposes.

   With the exception of Japan and China, Intercept Pharmaceuticals has worldwide rights to OCA. It has a licensing agreement with

    Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma
   </company>
   for the development of OCA in Japan and China. The company is seeking regulatory approval of the drug candidate in the US, Europe, and other countries.
  </p>
        <p>
   Intercept Pharmaceuticals earns revenue through licensing and collaboration agreements with third parties, including Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma, which is developing OCA in China and Japan, and

   , which is researching and developing liver disease treatments.
