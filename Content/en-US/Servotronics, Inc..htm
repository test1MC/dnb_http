  <p>
   Servotronics operates through two business segments: Advanced Technology (79% of net sales) and Consumer Products (21%). Advanced Technology designs, manufactures, and markets a variety of servo-control components which convert an electrical current into a mechanical force or movement and other related products. Consumer Products designs, manufactures, and sells a variety of edged products and tools for domestic and international distribution.

  <p>
   Advanced Technology targets the commercial aerospace, aircraft and government related industries, as well as medical and industrial markets. Consumer Products sells through national and international distributors as well as directly to big box, hardware, supermarket, variety, department, discount, gift, drug, outdoors, and sporting retailers.

  <p>
   Servotronics's revenues increased 4% from 2013 to 2014 mainly due to a 18% spike in Advanced Technology segment sales. However, the company posted its first net loss ($3 million) in at least 10 years in 2014. This was attributed to an arbitration award expense, which was related to an arbitration award originally issued in 2014 and finalized in 2015.
