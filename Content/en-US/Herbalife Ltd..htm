   Is it a weight-loss supplement or a way of life? Only Herbalife knows for sure. Herbalife manufactures and distributes weight control products that include meal replacements, snacks, and "enhancers." It also offers nutritional supplements (including products designed for everyday wellness and healthy aging); energy, sports, and fitness products (such as energy drinks); and skin care products. Herbalife's offerings are sold in about 90 countries. Its multilevel marketing program involves more than 3 million independent distributors throughout the world, as well as retail partners in some regions. Some of its independent distributors are actually individual customers who buy the products at a discounted rate.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Herbalife operates in six geographic segments: North America, Mexico, South and Central America, EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), the Asia/Pacific, and China. The company operates 400 locations around the globe. Adding partnerships with retailers, its products are sold through 700 locations. The Asia/Pacific region was the largest revenue contributor in 2012, accounting for nearly 30% of revenues with sales growing 20% over 2011.

        <p>
   Herbalife's largest operating segment is the weight management segment, which accounts for more than 60% of annual sales. The company's remaining products are categorized under the targeted nutrition segment, which includes a variety of nutritional products and accounts for more than 20% of revenues, and the energy and fitness and personal care segments.

        <p>
   A good chunk of Herbalife's operations are geared towards attracting and retaining distributors through promotions and technology support. Many of the company's independent distributors are actually individual customers who are attracted to the low start-up costs and heavily discounted products. Distributors have the option of selling products for a profit. Some also qualify for royalties and bonuses by sponsoring other distributors. Distributors provide product support and nutritional education to customers. Regulations in China require the company to conduct sales through retail stores, as well as through direct sales representatives in select regions where it is licensed.

        <p>
   Herbalife reported revenues of nearly $4.1 billion in 2012, an 18% increase over 2011 results. The company attributed its growth to increased sales of through DMOs (distributor methods of operations), increased engagement with distributors, increased average sales leaders, branding activities, and distributor recruitment efforts. The company has seen steadily rising revenues over the last four years.
  </p>
        <p>
   Net income in 2012 also increased 16% to some $477 million due to net sales growth, slightly offset by growth support expenses (in the form of higher sales, administrative, and general costs), higher interest expense, and higher income taxes.

        <p>
   Herbalife's core strategy is to recruit and retain independent distributors and increase retailing productivity. The company works with its distributors to promote daily consumption of its products and to maintain frequent contact with customers through DMO programs including nutrition clubs, weight loss challenges, and fitness camps. It also strives to increase brand awareness, product quality, and distributor support infrastructures (both physical and technological).

   While many of its products are made by third-party manufacturers, Herbalife is increasing its direct manufacturing operations for top selling products. It expanded its California manufacturing facility in 2011 (the plant was purchased in 2009). The company also expanded its existing facility in China, which manufactures all of the products the company sells in that country, and it added a raw material extraction joint venture in China in 2012. In addition, Herbalife is retrofitting a new manufacturing plant, investing about $100 million in machinery and technology, at a new plant in North Carolina; the plant was purchased in late 2012 and will begin production in 2014.

   New product development is a constant for the company. To supplement its in-house development scientists, Herbalife also sponsors research at

        <p>
   Mark Hughes' mother's death from an overdose of prescription diet pills was the catalyst for Herbalife. Hughes, a high-school dropout, founded the company with diet supplement maker Richard Marconi in 1980. Herbalife went public in 1986 after rapid growth, but it got into trouble for some of its product claims. Following federal and state investigations and US Senate hearings, Herbalife paid a hefty fine and removed some of its products from the market. Hughes was able to resurrect the firm by taking it overseas. Sales also got a boost from the success of the Thermojetics weight-control systems.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1995 Herbalife introduced a line of herbal and botanical skin care products (Dermajetics). In 1997 insider selling of stock prompted a major slide in the price of Herbalife shares. Earnings tanked in 1998 when economic crises hit such big revenue contributors as Russia and Asia.
  </p>
        <p>
   Hughes planned in 1999 to buy the company's outstanding shares and take the company private; investors sued. In 2000 he dropped the attempt. That year 44-year-old Hughes died in what was ruled an accidental death caused by a combination of alcohol and antidepressant medication. Hughes' longtime associate and former Herbalife COO Christopher Pair moved into the positions of president and CEO. He stepped down a year later after the company's board criticized his management.
  </p>
        <p>
   Later that year the Mark Hughes Family Trust turned down a $173 million bid for control of the company from Internet retailer Rbid.com. A group of investment firms bought the company in 2002 and Hughes' hopes to take the company private came to fruition without him. In 2004 Herbalife was hit with multiple lawsuits related to its ephedra-based weight-loss products. The FDA banned ephedra after it was linked to more than 150 deaths between 1994 and 2004.
  </p>
        <p>
   Beset with lawsuits and lacking a dynamic leader at the helm, the company slumped, and was subsequently acquired by a group of venture capital firms including Whitney &amp; Co. and Golden Gate Capital. Striving to reclaim the success it had in the 1980s, the company brought in fresh management in 2003, including several former Disney executives.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's flexible distribution model helped Herbalife expand into new markets. In 2010 it struck a distribution piggy-back agreement with a large retailer in Mexico, which gave Herbalife increased access to individual distributors who could pick up their orders at the retailer's local outlets. The company also authorized distributors to sell their meal replacement shakes in individual servings (as opposed to an entire month's supply); the sales model proved so successful that Herbalife expanded it into other countries.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company changed its name from WH Holdings (Cayman Islands), which operated through primary subsidiary Herbalife International, to Herbalife Ltd. in 2011.
