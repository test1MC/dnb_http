   Emerging from its long incubation as part of
   <company id="10062">
    Honeywell International
   </company>
   , in 2016 the company was spun off as AdvanSix, a major producer and global supplier of Nylon 6 materials. AdvanSix (2015 revenues of $1.3 billion) makes Nylon 6 (a polymer resin sold under the Aegis brand) to produce engineered plastics, fibers, filaments, and films. These in turn are used in end products such as automotive and electronic components, carpets, sports apparel, fishing nets, and food and industrial packaging. AdvanSix also produces caprolactam, the main feedstock for producing nylon; Capran nylon film; Sulf-N ammonium sulfate fertilizers; and chemical intermediates, including phenol, acetone, and Nadone cyclohexanone.

   Its main production facility in Hopewell, Virginia is one of the world's largest single-site production facilities for caprolactam, the primary feedstock in the production of nylon polymer. It also operates a nylon resin production facility in nearby Chesterfield, Virginia; a phenol and acetone production facility in Frankford, Pennsylvania; and a nylon film manufacturing site in Pottsville, Pennsylvania.

   The company serves 500 customers in more than 40 countries.

  <p>
   AdvanSix is looking to take advantage of its sustainable cost-advantaged position, vertically integrated manufacturing, global reach, and diverse revenue sources as an independent firm with a focus on a narrow range of products.
