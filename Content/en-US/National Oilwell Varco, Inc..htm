  <p>
   In fiscal 2015 National Oilwell Varco's net sales decreased by $6.6 billion due to decreased sales from Rig systems and Wellbore technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from Rig Systems declined due to lower land rig shipments and delayed delivery dates of certain offshore projects. Wellbore Technologies revenues decreased due to lower drilling activity.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2015 the company incurred a net loss of $769 million compared to $2.5 billion of net income in the previous year. The primary reason was due to decreased sales and increased goodwill and intangible asset impairment expenses partially offset by decreased selling, general and administrative expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net cash provided by the operating activities decreased by $1.2 billion compared to 2014.
