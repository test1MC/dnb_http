   Solutia looks to provide industrial solutions by manufacturing plastics, films, and chemicals for the construction, automotive, and rubber manufacturing industries. The company operates through three segments. Its Technical Specialties unit manufactures specialty chemicals for rubber and transmission fluids customers through its Flexsys, Terminol, and Skydrol businesses. Its Advanced Interlayers unit produces polyvinyl butyral (PVB) sheet, which is used in the manufacture of glass. Performance Films makes various plastic films for use in glass, tapes, and packaging products. Solutia has worldwide operations. In 2012 the company was acquired by
   <company id="16569">
    Eastman Chemical
   </company>
   in a $4.7 billion deal.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Solutia's global infrastructure consists of 26 manufacturing facilities, 6 technical centers and approximately 30 sales offices in the US, Europe, Latin America, and Asia/Pacific.

        <p>
   The company's revenues increased by 8% in 2011 due to higher selling prices of $76 million, higher sales volumes of $93 million, and favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations partially offset by the impact of divestitures of $66 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   Net income increased by 236% in 2011 due to a decrease in interest expense (thanks to lower expenses related to interest rate derivative contracts combined with a lower average debt balance and a lower average interest rate) and a drop in loss on debt extinguishment or modification, the result of the early extinguishment of a senior secured term loan (2014 Term Loan) and other factors.
  </p>
        <p>
   Except for a revenue slump in 2009. Solutia saw an upward trend in revenues from 2007 to 2011. The recession-driven slump in 2009 resulted from decreased sales volumes and the effect of unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations, while overall selling prices were flat year over year. Lower sales volumes were realized by all of the company's reporting segments due to continued weakness in demand across the global construction, automotive, and industrial markets related to the deterioration in the macroeconomic environment.

        <p>
   Prior to the Eastman Chemical deal the company sought to grow through acquisitions. In 2011 Solutia acquired
   <company id="14761">
    Southwall Technologies
   </company>
   in an all cash deal worth approximately $113 million. The acquisition added technology to the company's current portfolio of energy-saving films and glass products.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2010 Solutia added to its specialty chemicals business with the acquisition of German company Etimax Solar for $325 million. That company manufactures ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulants for the photovoltaic market. Solutia combined the new unit with its own polyvinyl butyral encapsulants, which are also used by the solar photovoltaic market. Solutia also acquired Vistasolarâ, another supplier of EVA encapsulants to the photovoltaic market, and Novomatrix, a distributor of performance window films.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Following its emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2008, Solutia made a decision to divest its nylon business in a strategy to focus on its performance materials and specialty chemicals businesses. In 2009 the company sold the segment to private equity group SK Capital Partners for about $50 million.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Before going solo, Solutia was the chemical side of the former Monsanto (which had merged with
   <company id="11570">
    Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn
   </company>
   and changed its name to Pharmacia; the new entity spun off its seeds and crop protection business as the new
   <company id="100932">
    Monsanto
   </company>
   before Pharmacia itself was acquired by Pfizer in 2003). John Queeny, dubbing the company with his wife's maiden name, started Monsanto in St. Louis after seeing an opening in the artificial-sweetener market. Saccharin was its first product (1902), followed by caffeine (1904), vanillin (1904), and aspirin (1917).
  </p>
        <p>
   The company acquired R. A. Graesser Chemical Works, the UK's leading producer of phenol (an ingredient in nylon), in 1919. It went public in 1927. A year later Queeny's son, Edgar, became president and expanded the company through aggressive licensing and acquisitions.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1938 the company entered the plastics and resins market. It bought Fiberloid (producer of celluloid, the first man-made plastic) and 50% of Shawinigan Resins (it bought the rest in 1963). In 1943 Monsanto produced styrene monomer, a key material for synthetic rubber needed by the US in WWII.
  </p>
        <p>
   Seven years later Monsanto and American Viscose formed Chemstrand to make Acrilan acrylic fiber and nylon. An agricultural division was created in 1960.
  </p>
        <p>
   Monsanto created AstroTurf (based on Monsanto's carpet-fiber technology) in 1966 to surface Houston's Astrodome field. In 1976 it produced the first plastic pop bottles, which were promptly taken off the market for possible cancer risks. A reformulated bottle gained approval in 1983, but the market had already been lost to other bottle makers.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company restructured in the 1980s and early 1990s. It sold its largest chemical business and purchased G.D. Searle (producer of Nutrasweet, 1985). Monsanto cut its workforce and divided its business into three life-sciences units and one chemical group. Monsanto used the chemical unit's strong cash flow to fund high-risk ventures in life sciences. Recognizing that investments in the chemical side of the company would take funds away from the agricultural aspect, Monsanto spun off the chemicals division in 1997. As part of the breakup, Solutia took $1 billion of Monsanto's corporate debt and $1 billion in retirement medical benefit payments.
  </p>
        <p>
   Solutia's then-CEO, Robert Potter, eliminated some excess administrative levels, cut 800 jobs, and linked executive pay to financial performance. He also started overhauling Solutia's entire supply chain and business processes.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1998 Solutia teamed with Bayer, Novus, and a Japanese company to double the size of its acrylonitrile (used in nylon carpet fibers, acrylic fibers, and other products) plant in Alvin, Texas. It also introduced an ingredient that prevents animal feed from becoming rancid.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1999 the company bought the window films business of chemical firm
   <company id="41855">
    Akzo Nobel
   </company>
   for $200 million and purchased Germany-based Vianova Resins for $640 million from Morgan Grenfell Private Equity Ltd. Potter retired that year, and John Hunter, a Monsanto veteran since 1969, was named CEO.
  </p>
        <p>
   By mid-1999, using the strong cash flow from its established businesses and cost reductions, Solutia managed to retire nearly half the debt it inherited at the time of the spinoff. Meanwhile, the company continued to make acquisitions.
  </p>
        <p>
   Solutia bought Switzerland-based pharmaceutical R&amp;D companies CarboGen Laboratories and AMCIS in 2000. It also combined its phosphorus operations with
   <company id="10540">
    FMC
   </company>
   to form joint venture Astaris. On the divestiture side, Solutia sold its polymer modifiers business to
   <company id="10558">
    Ferro Corporation
   </company>
   and its light denier industrial nylon fibers business to South African Nylon Spinners (SANS).
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2002 Solutia sold its 50% stake in an elastomer joint venture with
   <company id="56162">
    ExxonMobil Chemical
   </company>
   for about $100 million. In early 2003 the company sold several specialty products businesses to
   <company id="104897">
    UCB
   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   Solutia filed for Chapter 11 at the end of 2003 as a result of legacy costs associated with its spin-off from Monsanto, including Monsanto retiree health care obligations. In the middle of 2005 the company reached an agreement-in-principal with unsecured creditors and the new
   <company id="100932">
    Monsanto
   </company>
   to resolve historical liabilities. (The present-day Monsanto agreed to take over certain liabilities from Pharmacia when it was spun off in 2000.) One step toward solvency was the company's sale of
   <company id="61208">
    ICL Performance Products
   </company>
   (formerly Astaris), its joint venture with
   <company id="10540">
    FMC Corporation
   </company>
   , to
   <company id="107109">
    Israel Chemicals Limited
   </company>
   for $255 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   It finally emerged from Chapter 11 in 2008.
  </p>
        <p>
   In a move to grow in the Asia/Pacific region, Solutia purchased some assets of Taiwan-based Aimcore Technology for its Performance Films business. Solutia's expansion in the region is to take advantage of the burgeoning mobile electronics and smart window markets. The deal increased its capacity to produce its Flexvue film components used in touch screens, solar applications, and e-readers. The company had also expanded its Performance Films unit in 2010 with the purchase of Singapore-based Novomatrix, which distributes window films.
