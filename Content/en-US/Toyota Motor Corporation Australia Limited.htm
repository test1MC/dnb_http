   Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Limited (TMCA) is one of the larger car companies manufacturing and selling within the world's smallest continent. TMCA imports and sells various Toyota passenger and commercial vehicles, including Corolla, Prius, and LandCruiser 200 and 70 series, and it also manufactures two Toyota models, Camry and Aurion (a sporty, Camry-like car sold primarily in Australia). More than half of the vehicles that TMCA manufactures are exported; the exports -- primarily Camrys -- go to over 20 countries, with many going to New Zealand, Pacific Islands, and the Middle East. The company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of

   TMCA's manufacturing plant is located in Altona, while its sales and marketing operations are based in Sydney. The company imports and sells Toyota commercial vans, buses, and 4-wheel drive vehicles.  Additionally, the company manufactures a performance-enhanced TRD (Toyota Racing Development) version of its Aurion model. The company also sells Toyota's Lexus luxury-line vehicles.

   The company boasts being the largest exporter and the number-one seller of vehicles of any brand in Australia.

   In 2014, the company and
   <company id="41889">

   </company>
   announced plans for a new business structure from 2018 onward. Most of the Altona plant (which will cease manufacturing by the end of 2017) will be reestablished as a training and product development facility. Toyota's decision to stop manufacturing and continue TCMA as a national sales and distribution company from 2018 on allows the parent company more operational flexibility in its auto production and sales to the region currently served by TMCA.
