  <p>
   Parker-Hannifin is a leading worldwide diversified manufacturer of motion and control technologies and systems. It provides precision engineered technologies, products, and services for a wide variety of mobile, industrial, and aerospace markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its largest division, the Industrial segment, is made up of the Automation, Filtration, Fluid Connectors, Hydraulics, Instrumentation, and Seal groups. Sales of Industrial products in North American and international markets are made primarily to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their replacement markets in various sectors within the manufacturing, processing, and transportation industries. They include agriculture, alternative energy, chemical processing, construction machinery, factory automation, food production, life sciences, material handling, paper, robotics, and water, among many others.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aerospace segment products are sold mainly to commercial and military customers in the OEM and maintenance, repair, and overhaul end user markets. They are used in aircraft, engines, missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and in power generation applications.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Parker-Hannifin operates almost 300 manufacturing plants and nearly 100 distribution centers and 150 sales and administrative offices in 40 states and in roughly 50 other countries worldwide. North America accounts for roughly 60% of its sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Diversified Industrial products are made primarily to original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and their replacement markets in manufacturing, packaging, processing, transportation, mobile construction, refrigeration and air conditioning, agricultural, and military machinery and equipment industries. This segment's sales are marketed primarily through field sales employees and approximately 13,200 independent distributor locations throughout the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aerospace products cater to the commercial and military aerospace markets to both OEMs and to end-users for spares, maintenance, repair, and overhaul.

  <p>
   Parker-Hannifin experienced an 11% drop in revenue from $12.7 billion in 2015 to $11.4 billion in 2016. Its profits also fell 20% from $1 billion to $807 million during that same time period mainly due to a spike in interest expenses. In addition, the company's operating cash flow decreased 10% from 2015 to 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue decline for 2016 was fueled by lower Diversified Industrial North American operations sales, reflecting lower demand from distributors and end-users in most markets. This primarily included the oil and gas, construction equipment, and farm and agriculture equipment sectors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Diversified Industrial International sales decreased in 2016 primarily due to lower volumes in Europe and the Asia/Pacific region. The largest decrease in sales was from distributors and end-users in the oil and gas, marine, engine, and construction equipment markets in these regions.

  <p>
   The company seeks to enhance its operations and profitability through a strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services and by divesting businesses that are not considered to be a good long-term fit. It also focuses on building up its operations around targeted regions, technologies, and markets through acquisitions and organic growth.

  <p>
   Parker-Hannifin uses acquisitions as a means of enhancing its product portfolio and growing its global footprint.
  </p>
  <p>
   To expand its filtration portfolio, in 2017 Parker Hannifin bought
   <company id="12842">
    CLARCOR
   </company>
   , a maker of mobile, industrial, and environmental filtration products, in a deal valued at $4.3 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company in late 2015 acquired President Engineering Group Limited (PEGL), based in Sheffield, UK. PEGL specializes in the design and manufacture of technically advanced, precision engineered cryogenic valves for liquefied natural gas (LNG) and industrial gas applications and specialized equipment for mining safety applications. The addition of PEGL allowed Parker to inherit product and manufacturing technologies and expanded systems capabilities along with solid brand names.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the summer of 2016, Parker Hannifin acquired Jäger Automobil-Technik GmbH and Jäger Automotive Polska Sp. z.o.o, headquartered in Hannover, Germany. The Jäger Group is a pioneer in rubber-to-plastic direct bonded sealing systems for automotive markets and a leading developer of two-component (2K) direct injection molding technology. The deal provided Parker with innovative injection molding technology and businesses with a strong reputation in the automotive industry.

  <p>
   Entrepreneurial engineer Arthur Parker founded the Parker Appliance Company in 1918 to make pneumatic brake boosters. Its products were designed to help trucks and buses stop more easily. Unfortunately, Parker's own truck slid off an icy road and over a cliff in 1919, destroying the company's inventory and ending that line of business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Undeterred, Parker started a hydraulics and pneumatic components business in 1924 to serve automotive and industrial clients. In 1927 the fuel-linkage system the company developed for the
   <i>
    Spirit of St. Louis
   </i>
   helped Lindbergh cross the Atlantic. The company prospered during the Depression; sales reached $2 million in 1934. Two of Parker's long-term clients were Douglas Aircraft and
   <company id="10903">
    Lockheed
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company went public in 1938. It employed 5,000 defense workers during WWII. After Parker died in 1945, his wife Helen hired new management to focus on the automation market. The firm bought cylinder maker Hannifin in 1957 and became Parker-Hannifin.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1960 Parker-Hannifin formed an international unit in Amsterdam, and it set up a German subsidiary in 1962. Overseas acquisitions and increased demand from the space program and the aviation market spurred growth in the 1960s. Patrick Parker, the founder's son, became president in 1968 and chairman in 1977. Parker-Hannifin expanded its aerospace business in 1978 with the purchase of Bertea (electrohydraulic flight controls). Patrick Parker continued as CEO until 1983 and as chairman until 1999.
