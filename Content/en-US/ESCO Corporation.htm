   ESCO is well ensconced as a global manufacturer of metal parts, castings, and components for industrial machinery. Mining customers account for the majority of sales for ESCO's engineered products, which include crusher wear-parts and bi-metallic buttons, as well as screens, blocks, tooth systems, and other heavy parts that hit the dirt and wear out. The company also has divisions specializing in engineered parts and components for the construction, industrial, oil, and gas sectors. ESCO was founded in 1913 as Electric Steel Foundry, which primarily made trolley car replacement parts.

   In 2015 ESCO launched a new supply and service branch in Charleston, West Virginia. With an increased focus on expanding sales of its products to mining  customers in the Appalachian region, ESCO established this new location to create a direct customer connection with nearby mines. The branch also allowed ESCO to localize sales and distribution of ESCO products for all of West Virginia, as well as parts of Virginia and eastern Kentucky. The branch is geographically located in a region with a high concentration of coal mining, including some of the largest coal producing companies in North America.
