   And lo, the Hittites did rise up out of their land (the Commonwealth of Massachusetts), and they did conquer Babylon...well, semiconductors, in any case. Hittite Microwave designs and develops microwave, millimeter-wave, and radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs) for aerospace, broadband, cellular, and military applications. In addition to standard amplifiers, frequency multipliers, mixers, modulators, switches, and other components, the company provides custom RFICs. It gets more than half of its sales from overseas customers.
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   (about 14% of sales) is Hittite Microwave's top customer. Hittite Microwave was acquired by rival
   <company id="10112">
    Analog Devices
   </company>
   in 2014 in a deal valued at about $2 billion.

   Rival semiconductor maker
   <company id="10112">
    Analog Devices, Inc
   </company>
   . acquired Hittite Microwave in July 2014 for $78 per share in cash. The deal reflected a total enterprise value for Hittite of approximately $2 billion. As a result, Hittite's shares were delisted from the NASDAQ stock exchange.

  <p>
   Massachusetts-based Hittite Microwave rang up 43% of its 2013 sales in the US. International sales accounted for the balance. The company has operations in Mexico, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, Japan, China, India, Israel, Korea, and Taiwan.

   The semiconductor firm is reliant on a small number of customers. Indeed, Hittite's 10 largest customers accounted for 35%, 40%, and 43% of annual revenue in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. Aerospace giant
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   is Hittite's #1 customer, accounting for 14% of its 2013 sales, versus 16% in each of the two prior years.

  <p>
   Hittite reported sales of $273.8 million in 2013, a 4% increase versus 2012. Net income rose 2% over the same period to $70 million. The uptick was driven by increasing sales to the microwave and millimeter wave communications market, and, to a lesser extent, higher sales to the cellular and broadband markets, partially offset by lower sales to the military and the test and measurement markets. Cash flow from operations increased by $11.8 million over 2012 to nearly $80 million in 2013.

   As a fabless semiconductor company, Hittite Microwave contracts out the production of its chips. Its principal foundry contractors are

   , Telefunken Semiconductor,
   <company id="17092">
    TriQuint Semiconductor
   </company>
   , United Monolithic Semiconductors (UMS), and WIN Semiconductors. Hittite Microwave also competes with some of those companies with its microwave and RFICs. Some of these companies (such as TriQuint and UMS), as well as customers such as
   <company id="41876">
    NEC
   </company>
   , are also competitors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Part of its strategy to preserve its own competitive niche is to concentrate on delivering high-performance rather than high-volume, addressing technically challenging needs rather than offering commodity RFICs. Even with its standard products, which serve a variety of basic needs, Hittite Microwave aims for a unique combination of form factor, functionality, and performance to set itself apart in the marketplace.

   In January 2011, Hittite Microwave acquired Norway-based Arctic Silicon Devices, a developer of mixed-signal integrated circuit technology, for about $12 million. The purchase gave the company new IC design and integration capabilities, as well as an analog-to-digital converter product line used in test and measurement and communications infrastructure applications.
