  <p>
   Saint-Gobain organizes its business into four segments. Its Innovative Materials unit, which comprises the company's flat glass and high-performance materials activities, showcases Saint-Gobain's technological expertise and serves the habitat, construction, and industrial markets. Saint-Gobain also devotes two-thirds of its total research and development dollars to this unit. The company's Packaging segment is one of the world's top makers of glass containers, supplying bottles for wines and spirits and jars for food products. Other products include glass bottles for beer, fruit juices, soft drinks, mineral water, and oil.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another segment, Construction Products is focused on acoustic and thermal insulation products, wall facings, roofing products, pipes, and other interior and exterior building items, including those that provide energy savings. Saint-Gobain's Building Distribution business, which generates most of its revenue, provides services for building professionals, large companies, and private project owners.

   In 2015 Saint-Gobain expanded its partnership with YouthBuild USA, Inc. to South Africa, extending the current national partnership through 2017 with a commitment of $600,000 to teach the next generation how to build responsibly and in a sustainable manner.
  </p>
  <p>
   Saint-Gobain announced in early 2013 plans to sell its Verallia North American glass container operation to Ireland's Ardagh Group for $1.7 billion by the end of the year as the company plans to exit the low-margin business to focus on its higher-margin building materials operations, including energy-efficient buildings. The downturn in both the auto industry (industrial glass) and Western Europe building activities conspired against a turnaround for the unit. Saint-Gobain is also considering alternatives for Verallia's European and Latin American activities, such as an initial public share offering or straight disposal.

  <p>
   In 2015 Saint-Gobain agreed to buy Oregon-based Structus Building Technologies, a manufacturer of innovative, high-performance drywall corner solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company purchased American Fluoroseal Corporation (AFC), which makes fluoropolymer bags for medical use and sterile sampling systems for the pharmaceutical manufacturing process. Based in Maryland, AFC's business complements Saint-Gobain's existing film production and single use systems for biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Buying AFC allows the company to serve customers looking for vessels or bags used in very specific cell culture applications.

  <p>
   The acquisition follows Saint-Gobain's late 2012 purchase of Michigan's Twin Bay Medical, a company that caters to the biopharmaceuticals manufacturing sector with BarbLock-brand flexible tube retainers and single-use components. The deal included a production facility located in Williamsburg, Michigan, all employees, and its development organization.
