   Visant Holding is a real class act. Through its Jostens Scholastic unit, the company provides school-related affinity products, such as class rings and graduation items, mostly to North American high schools and colleges. It also makes championship rings for professional sports and specialty markets. The Jostens Memory Book unit makes yearbooks for US middle and high schools and universities. Visant's Marketing and Publishing Services group produces advertising and direct marketing materials for the fragrance, cosmetics, and personal care markets, as well as the direct marketing sector. The company was formed in 2004 through the consolidation of Jostens, Von Hoffmann, and Arcade; consumer products company

   </company>
   owns it.

  <p>
   Of Visiant's three business segments its Scholastic business is the largest, accounting for nearly 40% of sales. The firm's Memory Book and Marketing and Publishing divisions each contribute about 30% of sales.

   Visant's sales fell 5% in 2012 versus 2011 and its net loss widened to $58.6 million. The slide in sales in 2012 was felt acrross all three of its divisions. The Scholastic division saw its sales decline by 6% on lower volumes of jewelry and announcement products sold and a shift in the jewelry sales metal mix from gold to lower priced metals. The Memory Book and Marketing and Publishing divisions each posted sales declines of more than 4% on lower volumes. Indeed, Visant's total sales have fallen by about 15% since 2008 on decreased demand for its products. US sales fell by 5%, while sales in Canada and France posted double-digit declines.

   In late 2015 Visant was acquired by consumer products company
   <company id="16009">
    Jarden
   </company>
   for about $1.5 billion. Jarden owns such diverse products as Sunbeam and Oster appliances, Coleman outdoor gear, Ball canning jars, K2 snowboards, and Bee and Bicycle brand playing cards. It will add Visant's school products to its team sports and educational lines.

   Acquisitive Visant is expanding its Scholastic division. In 2010 company paid roughly $6 million for Canada's Intergold, which makes championship rings and other jewelry for schools, corporations, and professional sports teams. Visant shelled out another $4 million (via a stock acquisition) for Iowa-based letter jacket producer Rock Creek Athletics. The Rock Creek deal complemented Visant's $2 million asset purchase of team outerwear maker Rennoc in 2009. Adding Rennoc, a top name in letter jacket manufacturing and distributing, made Visant a leader in that niche of the awards market and gave the firm a foot in the door with sporting goods dealers.
