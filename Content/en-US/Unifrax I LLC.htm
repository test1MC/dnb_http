   Unifrax keeps its cool in some very hot environments. The company makes heat-resistant ceramic fibers used primarily as insulation in automotive, commercial, and industrial applications.

Its brands include Fiberfrax, Insulfrax, and Isofrax. Based in the US, Unifrax does business throughout the Americas as well as in Asia, Australia, and Europe. The company is owned by investment firm American Securities LLC.

The companies produce and market more than 2,000 different products, including vacuum formed ceramic fiber shapes, to the European foundry and domestic appliance markets. The deal is expected to enhance Unifrax's vacuum-forming business, and in turn, its competitive position in Europe.
