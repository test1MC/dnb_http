   Acuity has enjoyed historic growth over the last few years. From 2015 to 2016 its total sales increased by 22% from $2.71 billion to $3.29 billion, its biggest revenue total in history. Profits jumped 31% from $222 million in 2015 to $291 million in 2016, another company milestone. Cash flow also jumped from $289 million to $346 million during that same time period.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 2016 growth was driven by a 20% spike in sales from the US and a 41% spike in international sales. The company was also helped by additional revenue from previous acquisitions.

  <p>
   Acquisitions are also helping Acuity exploit a wide-spectrum of technologies, intended to offer customers a one-stop source. In the summer of 2016, Acuity obtained DGLogik, a San Francisco Bay Area-based provider of software that enables users to visualize the Internet of Things (IoT). The acquisition expanded the company's portfolio of holistic IoT products and services for the growing market for intelligent networked systems that collect and exchange data to increase efficiency. The new software also offers data analytics to better enable smart buildings and smart cities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2016, Acuity picked up GeoMetri, a provider of a software and services platform used for mapping, navigation, and analytics. The acquisition added advanced indoor mapping and navigation capabilities to the ByteLight indoor positioning technology product owned by Acuity.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Acuity acquired Distech Controls, a provider of building automation products that allow for the integration of lighting, HVAC, access control, closed circuit television, and related systems. The acquisition is part of the company's strategy to offer a single digital ecosystem that will allow for all aspects of a building, including a quality visual environment, seamless operation, energy efficiency, operational cost reductions, and increased digital functionality.
