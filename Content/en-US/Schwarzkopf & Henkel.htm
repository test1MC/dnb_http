   Schwarzkopf &amp; Henkel, formerly Schwarzkopf &amp; DEP, could be called a "holding" company for doing its part to keep the hairstyles of harried humans securely in place. In addition to its L.A. Looks and DEP gel hairstyling lines, the subsidiary sells Agree shampoos and conditioners, Cuticura medicated antibacterial soaps and powders, Fa body washes, Lavoris mouthwash, Lilt home permanents, Porcelana fading skin cream, Schwarzkopf hair coloring, and Topol whitening toothpaste. Its products are sold in more than 100 countries. Schwarzkopf &amp; Henkel is a subsidiary of the German chemical maker

   Founder Arnold Lewis invented DEP styling gel for use in his chain of California salons after WWII. DEP (from a nickname bestowed by warehouse workers after an ingredient, deprovinyllol) was incorporated in 1956; DEP hair gel was its only product. Robert Berglass became president in 1969 after buying a chunk of DEP; he then took DEP into retail outlets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company went public in 1983. When Berglass wanted to expand in 1986, he raised $16.5 million through junk-bond king Michael Milken. The next year DEP acquired Lavoris, Topol, and Porcelana from Jeffrey Martin, Inc. To update its image, DEP redesigned product packaging and increased advertising. In 1990 DEP bought Lilt from Procter &amp; Gamble.
  </p>
  <p>
   L.A. Looks took off in 1991, three years after its introduction, and surpassed DEP's sales in 1992. In 1993 DEP acquired Halsa and Agree from

    S.C. Johnson &amp; Son
   </company>
   only to find out that the brands' sales were overstated -- and falling. DEP filed suit, but declining sales for the brands and expenses related to the acquisition led to losses in 1994 and 1995. The firm filed for bankruptcy and settled the suit out of court in 1996. Bouncing back, DEP emerged from Chapter 11 and launched two premium-priced brands in 1997: Le Systeme skin care and Theorie hairstyling. In 1998

    Henkel
   </company>
   paid $93 million for DEP and combined it with Schwarzkopf, a hair care company Henkel acquired from German chemical concern Hoechst in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Henkel launched the first ever TV commercials for DEP's L.A. Looks hair-care brand to increase slumping sales and introduced its Fa body washes to the US market. The Natures Family line, made with no animal ingredients or testing, was released in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 the company's President, Herman Ter Haar, was replaced by Tom Parr.
