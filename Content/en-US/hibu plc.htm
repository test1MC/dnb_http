   hibu (formerly Yell Group) helps small and medium-sized businesses connect with consumers in the busy business information age. The company offers both newer digital services and traditional print products. It offers an eMarketplace platform through which merchants can market and sell their products and services, as well as acquire and manage customers. It also offers digital and print directories, including Yell.com and Yellow Pages in the UK, Yellowbook in the US, and Paginas Amarillas in Spain and Latin America. hibu (pronounced "high-boo") changed its name and brand from Yell Group in mid-2012 to reflect its evolution from being just a print advertising provider to a digital services provider as well.

   hibu has consumer- and merchant-facing products and services in the UK, the US, Spain, Argentina, Chile, and Peru. It also has offices in India and the Philippines. The US accounts for more than half of hibu's total revenues, with a specific emphasis on growing customers in US Hispanic markets.

   in Spain. All told, the company boasts more than 300 live websites and some 1,200 business-to-consumer (B2C) yellow pages directories, in which businesses pay for advertising. Newer products and services include the hibu eMarketplace at hibu.com and hibu.co.uk, online stores and self-serve facilities that provide businesses with an e-commerce platform to create their own websites and transact with consumers through those websites, and mobile services through partnerships with German cloud platform provider Netbiscuits and Palo Alto, California-based shopping app provider Shopkick.

   The economic landscape remained difficult in fiscal 2012 (ends March) for hibu and its small and medium-sized business customer base, particularly in Spain. hibu's print and digital directory revenues are on the decline as consumers change their information searching behavior and small businesses adapt their advertising accordingly.
  </p>
  <p>
   Overall group revenue fell about 14% in fiscal 2012 due to a decline in digital and print directories, partially offset by the growth in digital services (primarily derived from providing online search and websites). The decline in digital and print directory revenues is also having an adverse effect on the company's earnings. To mitigate this decline, hibu is trying to reduce costs and maintain tighter expenditure controls. It is also continuing to contend with a heavy debt load -- having reduced net debt by 20% in fiscal 2012 -- and revising its capital structure in fiscal 2013.

   In order to deal with declines in directory revenues and survive in a market dominated by
   <company id="59101">
    Google
   </company>
   , hibu, then Yell Group, began embarking on a strategy in 2011 to transform from being a leading provider of print and online advertising for small and medium-sized businesses to being a leading provider of digital business tools and services for that market. Launched in 2012, the company's hibu eMarketplace platform and portal, in which businesses and consumers can connect and transact, is an important component of this effort. The company also renamed and rebranded itself as hibu in July of that year to reflect a more comprehensive focus on digital services.

  <p>
   In support of its eMarketplace strategy, hibu acquired the #1 hosted site builder in the UK, Moonfruit Limited, for £18 million ($29 million) in cash in June 2012. More than five million sites and 230,000 shops have been built using Moonfruit, which focuses on "light" commerce site building for small businesses and individuals. The deal complements the website building capabilities of Znode, which hibu acquired for £12 million ($19.2 million) in July 2011. The purchase of Ohio-based Znode gives hibu the other side of the coin -- an enterprise commerce platform.
