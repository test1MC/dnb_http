   Printed circuit board manufacturer Park Electrochemical has parked its manufacturing facilities where it can reach its niche market customers -- in Asia, Europe, and North America. The company's Nelco brand of copper-clad laminates and reinforced composite materials are used to make printed circuit boards and other components for laptop computers, cellular phones, satellite switching systems, and other electronics. Park also makes engineered materials, including composites for electronics, aerospace, and industrial markets. About half of Park's sales come from Asia and Europe.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Park's manufacturing facilities are located in France, Singapore, and the US (Arizona, California, and Kansas). The company also maintains R&amp;D facilities in Arizona, Kansas, and Singapore. The company's sales in North America, Asia, and Europe are 50%, 42%, and 6%, respectively.

  <p>
   Park develops and manufactures high-technology digital and RF/microwave printed circuit materials primarily for the telecommunications and internet infrastructure and high-end computing market and advanced composite materials, parts and assemblies for the aerospace market. Park's core capabilities are in polymer chemistry formulation and coating technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's two major product categories are: Printed Circuit Materials; and Advanced Composite Materials, Parts, and Assemblies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Park is a designer and manufacturer of advanced printed circuit materials used to fabricate complex multilayer printed circuit boards and other electronic interconnection systems, such as multilayer back-planes, wireless packages, high-speed/low-loss multilayers and high density interconnects.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also develops and makes engineered, advanced composite materials and advanced composite parts and assemblies for the aerospace markets and prototype tooling for such parts and assemblies. Its advanced composite materials are developed and manufactured by the company's Park Aerospace Technologies Corp. business unit, and by Park's Nelco Products Pte. Ltd. business unit in Singapore.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales of Park's printed circuit materials products account for more than 70% of the company's total revenues.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Customers for Park's advanced printed circuit materials include leading independent printed circuit board fabricators, electronic manufacturing service companies, electronic contract manufacturers and major electronic OEMs in the computer, networking, telecommunications, wireless communications, and transportation segments worldwide. Customers for the company's rocket motor materials (primarily used for commercial and military space launch, and for tactical and strategic weapons) include US-based defense prime contractors and subcontractors.

  <p>
   The company's net sales decreased by 10% in fiscal year 2016 (February year end) to $145.9 million due to lower sales of printed circuit materials products in Asia and North America, partially offset by higher sales of aerospace composite materials, parts and assemblies, and low-volume tooling. The lower sales in Asia were the result of a slowdown in demand for Park's products used by OEMs in the manufacture of equipment for the internet and telecommunications infrastructure in developing countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Park's 2016 net income decreased from $20 million in fiscal 2015 to $18 million, primarily due to lower sales and production levels of  printed circuit materials products in Asia and North America (combined with the fixed nature of certain overhead costs), partially offset by higher aerospace product sales, an improvement in its printed circuit materials production processes in North America, cost reduction initiatives in the US and lower utility rates. Net income also benefited from a rise in sales of higher margin, high performance printed circuit materials products and of Park's more technically advanced high performance products, coupled with a 13% reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash provided by operating income declined from $29 million in fiscal 2015 to about $14 million in fiscal 2016 due to a 29% drop in inventory stemming from lower sales and production; a 63% decline in prepaid expenses and other current assets; and an 11% decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of payments to vendors and raw material purchases from suppliers. Other factors included a 29% cut in income taxes payable as a result of a reduction in taxable income in Singapore in 2016; a 70% decrease in the current portion of long-term debt due to a new credit agreement with

   Bank USA compared to the credit agreement with
   <company id="11138">

   </company>
   Bank; and a 24% decrease in deferred income tax liabilities due to income tax payments made in connection with the $61 million repatriation of cash from Singapore to the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, Park paid $8.2 million and $39.6 million in cash dividends during 2016 and 2015, respectively, including a special cash dividend of $31.4 million paid in the fourth quarter of 2015. During 2016, it received $2 million of proceeds from the sale of the Nelco Zhuhai building in Zhuhai, China, made $19 million of principal payments on its long-term debt, and purchased treasury shares for $12.2 million.

   programs, and major jet engine production. It is also working with a large electronics OEM to develop next generation electronics materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   Park's business strategy is to develop long-term relationships with a select group of customers. Its top ten customers account for more than 50% of its annual sales.
