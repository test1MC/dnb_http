It's a leading maker of more than 200 frozen and ready-to-heat meals sold mostly under the Michelina's and Boston Market brands but also Lean Gourmet and Budget Gourmet.

  <p>
   The company is named after Paulucci's familial home in Bellisio Solfare, Italy. Paulucci has long been associated with convenience foods: He originally invented Jeno's pizza rolls, a brand now owned by
   <company id="10639">
    General Mills
   </company>
   . The company changed its name from Michelina's in 2007; the rebranding resulted from the growth of its product lines and its expansion into serving foodservice customers.
