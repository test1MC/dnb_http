  <p>
   Tekelec's strategy is to tap into its installed base and customer relationships to extend its share of the market by offering products that function within existing networks while allowing customers to transition to next-generation networks.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the past, Tekelec has dealt with revenue declines related to delays in the deployment of 3G networks in certain markets (such as India) and government security regulations that, along with other factors, kept orders down. The company has also boosted its international presence through marketing alliances with global distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   In product development, the company has been focusing on its next-generation portfolio, which is powered by EAGLE XG middleware and provides session and policy management, performance management, and other services that meet the challenges of changing networks.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 company released its market-leading Policy Server, which enables service providers to rapidly create and introduce new mobile data and digital lifestyle options and partner with advertisers, businesses, and Wi-Fi network providers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Tekelec partnered with Roke Manor Research Ltd. for successful interoperability testing between Tekelec's Mobile Policy Gateway (MPG) and Roke's SmartSwitch subscriber engagement and connection management app. The app allows the company to extend policy rules from the core network to handsets, tablets, and other smart communication devices.

  <p>
   Tekelec was co-founded in 1971 by Jean-Claude Asscher to distribute test equipment made by Tekelec-Airtronic, a French company also overseen by Asscher. Tekelec entered the communications diagnostic business in 1979. Asscher was named chairman in 1982 and led the company's move public in 1986. Two years later Tekelec acquired Protocol Technologies in order to enter the market for Signaling System 7 (SS7) switching technology, which was first used to provide services such as 800 number calling and calling card verification. It introduced the Eagle STP SS7 switch in 1992.
  </p>
  <p>
   With sales of diagnostic equipment stagnating, Tekelec made the decision to focus on switching products after losing money in 1996. In a push internationally, Eagle systems that year were sold to Telintar in Argentina, Telnor in Mexico, and the Societe Internationale Telecommunications Aeronautique in England.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1997 the Telecommunications Act of 1996 had helped boost the company's business. That year Tekelec added local number portability capabilities to Eagle so that customers could keep their phone numbers when they changed service providers. Telekom South Africa and Rogers Cantel, Canada's largest wireless provider, both purchased systems by 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 the company streamlined operations by combining two diagnostic product divisions. Tekelec added call center management software to its portfolio when it acquired IEX Corporation later that year. The company in 2000 expanded its UK-based European headquarters by adding a customer support center and began adapting its diagnostic systems for wireless broadband network testing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year Tekelec continued to pursue contracts with wireless broadband carriers, adding
   <company id="10950">
    Nextel
   </company>
   , VoiceStream, and
   <company id="126039">
    Verizon Wireless
   </company>
   as clients. Tekelec sold its diagnostic equipment unit, which made products for testing and monitoring networks, to Catapult Communications in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tekelec acquired next-generation network switching equipment makers
   <company id="101034">
    Santera Systems
   </company>
   (2003),
   <company id="110583">
    Taqua
   </company>
   (2004), and
   <company id="102801">
    VocalData
   </company>
   (2004). Tekelec also bought privately held maker of network performance management software, Steleus, in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Tekelec sold its IEX subsidiary, a developer of workforce and performance management software for call centers, to
   <company id="47719">
    NICE Systems
   </company>
   for $200 million in cash. The following year it sold its Switching Solutions Group (SSG) -- which was formed from its purchases of Taqua, Santera Systems, and VocalData -- to Internet protocol networking systems provider
   <company id="103943">
    GENBAND
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 Tekelec acquired one of its partners, Netherlands-based messaging software developer mBalance Group, for about $39.5 million in cash. With the purchase Tekelec gained applications that mobile operators use to support text messaging.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Tekelec bought Camiant, a supplier of policy control software for telecom carriers, for $135 million in cash. The same year it acquired subscriber data management software provider Blueslice Networks for $35 million in cash. The purchases broaden Tekelec's software portfolio for communications service providers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2011, CEO Frank Plastina stepped down, and was replaced by director Krish Prabhu on an interim basis. The following year Tekelec was taken private by a consortium of investors led by Siris Capital Group for $780 million; other buyers included ComVest, Sankaty Advisors, and
