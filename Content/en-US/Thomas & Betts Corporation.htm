   engineering graduates Hobart D. Betts and Robert McKean Thomas founded a distribution company for the infant electrical industry; they quickly moved into designing conduits and fittings. In 1905 the company incorporated as Thomas and Betts Company, and in 1912 it began manufacturing with the purchase of Standard Electric Fittings. In 1917 the two merged to form The Thomas &amp; Betts Company, consolidating operations in Elizabeth, New Jersey.

   In mid-2012, a new chapter in T&amp;B's history occurred when it was acquired by

   for about $3.9 billion. ABB made the transaction in order to double its low-voltage products inventory and gain significant ground in the US market. At the time of the transaction, Zurich-based ABB had a presence in about 100 countries and was primarily known for selling circuit breakers, switchgear, transformers, sensors, breakers, switches, generators and power electronics systems.
