   The detection and monitoring instruments of RAE Systems will confirm the presence of gas and detail its chemical composition. The company went from being a supplier of stand-alone analytical instruments to providing networked instrumentation that can be used in many locales, from factories to spills of hazardous materials, and even to find those pesky missing weapons of mass destruction. RAE Systems counts the US Departments of

   Before being acquired by Honeywell, RAE Systems underwent a plethora of changes. The company's headcount has increased dramatically over the years, through acquisitions and internal growth. More than half of RAE's employees were based in China, which accounted for around a third of sales. The company has spent more than $10 million expanding its presence in the country. It owned a 96% interest RAE-KLH (Beijing), or RAE Beijing, a maker of personal security and safety monitors. It sold its 70% interest in RAE Coal Mine Safety Instruments (Fushun), known as RAE Fushun, to the Shenyang Research Institute of China Coal Research. RAE Systems did not receive compensation for the unit, but Shenyang Research Institute assumed all liabilities of the JV and will repay amounts owed to RAE Systems under its RAE KLH and RAE Shanghai entities by the JV. While the company is generally focused on products for the environmental protection and industrial markets in China, the JV was formed to develop coal mine safety products to take advantage of opportunities presented by the country's modernization of its coal mining industry.

   Beefing up its technology, in 2013 the company upgraded its Closed-Loop Wireless System to support MultiRAE multi-threat monitors in addition to ToxiRAE Pro single-gas instruments.
