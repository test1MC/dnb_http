   Carlsberg Breweries was created in 2001 when Carlsberg A/S and
   <company id="107086">
    Orkla ASA
   </company>
   combined their brewing operations. However, Orkla sold its interest in the brewery to Carlsberg A/S in 2004, making Carlsberg the sole onwer of the brewery.

   Like other global brewers, Carlsberg Breweries is focusing on growth in Central Europe and China. In 2004 the company purchased Germany's

   Following its decision to end a licensing deal with
   <company id="41146">
    Labatt
   </company>
   , the company opened its own Canadian and US subsidiaries in 2004.

   <company id="10359">
    The Coca-Cola Company
   </company>
   for $225 million to concentrate on growing its beer business.
