   USG, the maker of the world's top brand of wallboard, is one of the largest building products manufacturers and distributors in the US. The company operates in four divisions. Its gypsum unit, which accounts for about half of sales, manufactures wallboard, gypsum fiberboard, and other products for finishing interior walls, ceilings, and floors under the SHEETROCK, DUROCK, AND FIBEROCK brands. The ceilings division makes ceiling systems and acoustic tile, used mainly in commercial buildings. USG's distribution arm distributes building products through

   for $670 million.

   USG, through its subsidiary L&amp;W Supply, is the nation's largest distributor of drywall and related building products, operating 145 distribution branches in the US. USG's gypsum products are distributed through L&amp;W Supply, other specialty wallboard distributors, building materials dealers, home improvement centers, and other retailers and contractors.

  <p>
   USG's revenues have steadily climbed over the last five years. Revenues increased by 1% from $3.72 billion in 2014 to $3.78 billion in 2015 due to a 6% bump from its distribution segment. This was driven by volume and price improvement on sales of gypsum wallboard as well as a spike in sales volumes for metal, joint treatment, ceilings, and other products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income also climbed from 2014 to 2015 due to a key gain from an income tax benefit. The growth was also due to the absence of litigation settlement charges and long-lived asset impairment charges, which it incurred in 2014. Cash flow from operations has also gained upward momentum, almost doubling from $173 million in 2014 to $331 million 2015.

  <p>
   USG has long-term priorities in order to strengthen its core business. It plans to expand internationally in emerging markets and is also focused on creating new products. In 2014 it formed two equally owned joint ventures in USG Boral Building Products Pte. Limited, a company organized under the laws of Singapore, and USG Boral Building Products Pty Limited, a company organized under the laws of Australia, with Boral Limited (Boral). The joint ventures, operating as a segment of the company and known as USG Boral Building Products, distributes and sells building products, and mines raw gypsum along with natural and synthetic gypsum throughout Asia, Australasia, and the Middle East.

  <p>
   In 1901 a group of 35 companies joined to form U.S.G., the largest gypsum producing and processing business in the industry. Sewell Avery became CEO in 1905 (he led U.S.G. until 1951). U.S.G. began producing lime in 1915. It became United States Gypsum (U.S. Gypsum) in 1920 and began making paint in 1924. By 1931 it was producing insulating board and metal lath fields. It also added two lime businesses and two gypsum concerns.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought Masonite in 1984 and changed its name to USG the next year. It acquired Donn (remodeling materials) in 1986 and DAP (caulk and sealants) in 1987.
