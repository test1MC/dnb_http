   Everybody needs a Reed's. The company makes two dozen all-natural soft drinks, such as Original Ginger Brew and Virgil's Root Beer, as well as ginger candy, and three ginger-flavored ice creams. Reed's brews its drinks from roots, herbs, spices, and fruits in a manner similar to how beer is brewed from malt and hops (without alcohol, though -- carbonation is added to Reed's drinks separately). The company also owns the China Cola brand, which contains an herbal mixture designed to help digestion. Reed's products are sold in some 10,500 natural food and traditional supermarkets, as well as specialty stores and restaurants throughout North America. It also makes private-label products for retailers.

   Los Angeles-based Reed's has two production facilities in California and Pennsylvania and markets its products in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia. The US is the company's largest market, accounting for about 98% of sales. Reed's rings up just over 1% of its sales in Canada.

   Reed's sells its products through a network of natural, gourmet, and independent distributors, While the premium soda, candy, and ice cream maker traditionally focused on gourmet and natural food retailers to sell its products, Reed's has expanded its distribution to include about 25% of all traditional supermarkets, such as
   <company id="10864">
    Kroger

   ,
   <company id="11308">
    Safeway
   </company>
   , Ralph's, and
   <company id="113769">
    Bristol Farms
   </company>
   , as well as other large retailers such as
   <company id="17060">
    Costco
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="53503">
    BJ's Wholesale
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="40781">
    Cost Plus World Markets
   </company>
   . It also sells its soda to industrial cafeterias, bars, and restaurants.

   The company's sales increased 24% in 2013 versus 2012, to $37.3 million. The double-digit increase, which came on the heels of a 20% rise in sales in the previous annual comparison, was driven by Reed's Kombucha product line and incentives given to customers and retailers increase market share of the company's entire product line. (Kombucha sales began in the third quarter of 2012 and have since grown to account for 10% of the company's net revenue.) Despite impressive sales growth, Reed's posted a loss of $1.5 million in 2013, compared with a loss of about $500,000 in 2012. Reed's blamed the wider loss on an increase in cost of goods sold, promotional and other allowances, rising delivery and handling expenses, and other costs of doing business. Indeed, Reed's long streak of unprofitability extends back by about a decade.

   Reed's claims to be the fastest growing premium soda sold in supermarkets. In 2014 the soda maker signed a distribution deal with Haralambos Beverage Co., based in Industry City, California, to distribute its full line of Reed's Ginger Brews, Virgil's Root Beers, and Reed's Culture Club Kombucha throughout Southern California. That same year, the company partnered with Superior Beverage Group of Columbus, Ohio to distribute its sodas to on-premise/restaurant and bar retailers in northeast and central Ohio. It also entered into new distribution deals in North Carolina and elsewhere in California.

   In addition to growing its branded business, a key growth driver for Reed's is its nascent private-label business (launched in 2010), which primarily makes sparkling juices, waters, and teas for select customers. Other initiatives to grow sales and increase the brand's visibility include partnering with alcohol brands such as Dewar's and Bacardi to create co-branded cocktail recipes such as "Dewar's and Reeds" and a "Reed's Dark and Stormy."The company has expanded its product line in recent years through acquisitions and new product development. In 2012 the drinkmaker launched Reed's Culture Club Kombucha line of organic live beverages and quickly became the #2 national producer of Kombucha. Kombucha (a fizzy, tart, fermented tea) is the largest growth segment of the functional beverage category of drinks and foods, including coconut water, yogurt, and fresh juices.

   In 2013 the company expanded its presence in Canada through a new distribution agreement with
   <company id="111019">
    Lassonde Industries,
   </company>
   a manufacturer of fruit and vegetable juices for sale throughout North America. The agreement gives Lassonde the distribution rights for Reed's brands throughout Canada. Previously, Reed's inked a deal with beverage wholesaler Intrastate Distributors in 2012 to gain 100% coverage in Michigan and boost its presence in the greater Detroit and Ann Arbor markets.
