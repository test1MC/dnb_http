   William Whittaker founded the company in 1942 to make aircraft valves, later broadening the product line to include guidance systems. In 1964 new executives led the firm on a shopping spree that mingled everything from pleasure boats to industrial chemicals with Whittaker's existing product lines. By 1970 the company was deeply in debt. Whittaker began selling assets to focus on technology, industrial chemicals, recreational products, and metals. It sold off the metals and chemicals units in 1989 to concentrate on its high-tech business.

  <p>
   By 1993 about 70% of Whittaker's sales were defense-related, but military budget cuts forced the firm to reduce its reliance on Uncle Sam. The company made an ill-considered move into the computer networking business, paying $36 million for Hughes LAN Systems in 1995 and $118 million the next year for Xyplex, Raytheon's networking unit. Whittaker's networking foray was marred by late products and unanticipated costs. Shortly after the Xyplex deal, CEO Thomas Brancati was shown the door and former chairman Joseph Alibrandi returned from retirement to right the company.

   Whittaker began raising cash and refocusing on core operations in 1997. It sold its defense electronics unit to Condor Systems that year and jettisoned Xyplex and Aviant Information the next. In 1999 Meggitt, a maker of aerospace and electronics equipment, bought the company in a deal valued at $382 million.

   In 2002 Whittaker agreed to team up with Moog's Industrial Controls Division to develop gas turbine control products.
