   Murad wants you to love the skin you're in. The skin care products manufacturer's portfolio includes cleansers, toners, hydration and skin protection products, dietary supplements, and sunscreens. Murad's products are sold through the company's website, as well as through infomercials, beauty supply stores (such as

    Sephora
   </company>
   and
   <company id="60271">
    Ulta
   </company>
   ), salons, and spas in 40-plus countries. In addition to topical skin applications, Murad launched the concept of "Internal Skincare," or the science of boosting skin health by taking nutritional supplements. It also boasts a Skin Scope, which uses ultraviolet light to indicate skin factors such as sun exposure. The company was founded in 1989 by CEO Dr. Howard Murad, a dermatologist.

   The clinical skin-care company targets different age groups with different products and price points. Catering to mature women, Murad has jumped on the anti-aging bandwagon with its Age Reform and Resurgence lines of skin care products, which claim to counter loss of firmness, fine lines, and wrinkles, and age spots and uneven skin tone. Anti-aging products, such as the company's Intensive Wrinkle Reducer, can cost up to $150. For the opposite sex, Murad has a line of men's skin care called "Murad Man." The three-step system attempts to target men's skin care issues related to shaving, aging, and environmental damage. The company's Clean Scene line targets teens and young adults priced from $16 to $24.

   In addition to boosting its revenue with new product rollouts, Murad is looking outside the US for growth. Its goal is to grow its entire business by up to 25%, while looking to log only 5% in the US. To this end, it's extending its reach into Thailand. It launched its products there in late 2008 in hopes of making the country as popular a geographic segment as its business in the US and Europe. Paua Group International is Murad's exclusive distributor in Asia, excluding Malaysia and Singapore. The company is also expanding into China, Taiwan, and Vietnam.

   The growing company in 2014 relocated its corporate office to accommodate future expansion. Murad committed $35 million to move to its new 45,000-square-foot global headquarters in El Segundo, California, near the company's former headquarters location.
