  <p>
   Israeli army engineers Alon Cohen and Lior Haramaty met in 1988 and worked on one of the first text-to-speech systems that produced human-sounding speech, developed under contract from the Israeli Defense Ministry for the visually impaired. They founded VocalTec Ltd. in 1989 and developed one of the first digital soundboards for PCs. After bringing in entrepreneur and physician Elon Ganor as chairman and CEO in 1990, the company suffered minor annual losses through the 1990s, but continued to add products, including an audio recording and playback device in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   VocalTec released Internet Phone in 1995, the first software sold for PC users to transmit voice over the Internet. Motorola led a stampede of high-tech companies in signing licensing agreements to bundle Internet Phone with their products. VocalTec went public in 1996 and later that year bought UK-based Insitu, a collaborative computing software specialist. VocalTec took a big hit in 1996 partly as a result of the acquisition.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 the company changed its name to VocalTec Communications and picked up former ECI Telecom COO Doron Zinger as president. Expanded development and marketing costs left it in the red yet again. Deutsche Telekom, aiming to build a presence in a market threatening its bottom line, bought a stake in VocalTec later that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 VocalTec bought Tel Aviv-based Radlinx, a developer of products for sending faxes via the Internet. Also that year Ganor stepped down as CEO and was replaced by Zinger. Ganor remained chairman. In 1999 VocalTec formed an Internet-based telecommunications equipment development deal with network hardware giant Cisco as part of an intensified effort to focus on the service provider market. Zinger resigned that year and Ganor stepped back into the CEO slot.
  </p>
  <p>
   VocalTec reorganized in 2000 to focus on selling its products and newly expanded service offerings to smaller service providers and consumers instead of global communications carriers. The next year, to counteract difficult market conditions, VocalTec cut about a third of its staff and shut down TrulyGlobal when that US-based spinoff failed to secure additional funding.
