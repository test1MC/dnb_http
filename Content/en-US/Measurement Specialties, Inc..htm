   Sensing the pressure? Measurement Specialties would rather do that for you. The company's industrial product line includes sensors that measure such properties as fluid level, gas, concentration and flow rate, humidity, torque, pressure, vibrations, and more. Its sensors are used in aerospace, consumer appliance, environmental water monitoring, industrial, medical, military, test and measurement, transportation, and vehicle applications. The company's biggest customer,
   <company id="149685">
    Sensata Technologies
   </company>
   (about 10% of sales in 2014), serves the automotive market. US customers account for 40% of sales; those in China make up another 20%. In late 2014 the company was acquired by
   <company id="110386">
    TE Connectivity
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   TE Connectivity, one of the world's largest suppliers of electronic components, paid $1.7 billion in stock for Measurement Specialties to boost its offerings in the high-growth sensor industry.

  <p>
   When TE Connectivity brought Measurement Specialties into its fold Measurement Specialties was riding the increasing demand for sensors to higher revenue year after year and profits. In 2014 (year-end March and the last year for which Measurement Specialties reported results) revenue increased almost 20% to $412.6 million. Acquisitions were a big factor, but broader product adoptions drove organic growth to a tidy 9% from almost all product lines, particularly pressure/force, humidity, temperature and optical. As manufacturers work to bring their customers "smart" products that improve energy efficiency, Measurement Specialties expects demand for sensors to remain strong.

  <p>
   Measurement Specialties uses acquisitions to add technologies, expand product lines, and grow geographically. The company has spent a combined $330 million snapping up 21 businesses since 2004. With its strategy of using customer proximity to maintain strong service levels for its global customers and attain economies of scale, acquisitions come from all around the world, and usually correspond to the amount of revenue a region brings in. While China is the exception to that rule (the #2 region for Measurement Specialties, but producing only one purchase in the above-noted period), third-ranked region France, and Europe in general, has been a hotspot for strategic buys, behind only the US.

  <p>
   In mid-2014 the company made its largest acquisition to date with the purchase of Norway-based Wema Group Holdings AS for $114.5 million. Wema Group is the global leader in SCR (selective catalytic reduction) tank level sensors, as well as urea quality sensors and diesel fuel level sensors.
