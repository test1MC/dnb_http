   Akorn has its roots firmly planted in the pharmaceutical industry. The firm makes and sells branded and generic drugs in therapeutic and diagnostic categories including ophthalmology, injectables, and specialty therapeutics. Akorn's ophthalmic segment includes antibiotics, steroids, glaucoma treatments, and diagnostic stains and dyes, as well as prescription and OTC eye care products. The firm's injectable and hospital-administered therapeutics segment includes anti-infectives, antidotes, anesthesia agents, pain management drugs, and other specialty substances. Akorn also provides contract drug manufacturing services. Chairman John Kapoor is the company's largest shareholder, owning a one-third stake in Akorn.

  <p>
   Akorn has manufacturing plants in the US (one in Illinois, one in New York, and one in New Jersey) and India, and nearly all of its revenues come from sales in the US market. The company also operates a Research and Development center in Vernon Hills, Illinois and a distribution warehouse in Gurnee, Illinois.

  <p>
   The company's largest operating segment is ophthalmics, which brings in about 36% of annual revenues, followed by hospital drugs and injectables, which together account for 57% of sales. Many of Akorn's products are generic drugs licensed from external sources, though it is working to increase the number of internally developed products in both the branded and generic categories. The company manufactures a variety of pharmaceutical products for third party pharmaceutical customers based on their specifications. Contract services accounted for 7% of Akorn's revenues in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through subsidiary Advanced Vision Research, the company makes and markets a line of over-the-counter (OTC) ophthalmic products for the treatment of dry eye under the TheraTears brand name, as well as a portfolio of private label OTC ophthalmic products.

  <p>
   Akorn's products are sold nationally to hospitals, physicians, optometrists, group purchasing organizations, pharmacies, and wholesalers via direct sales representatives and independent distributors. The company's three biggest customers, accounting for about two-thirds of its 2013 sales, are wholesalers

  <p>
   The company has reported year-to-year revenue growth since 2009. Revenues rose by 24% in 2013 due to primarily from increased sales of new and revived products, which accounted for $48.5 million of the increase.  Its hospital drugs &amp; injectables saw a surge in the sales of new and revived products, with more than half of the increase attributable to progesterone capsules and Td vaccine. Ophthalmic segment revenues grew due to increase in OTC product sales of TheraTears branded products and private label products, and sales of products acquired late in 2013 from
   <company id="11326">
    Merck
   </company>
   . Contract services revenue also increased due to a rise in US contract services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Akorn's net income increased by 48% in 2013 due to a bargain purchase gain and a decline in interest expense, related to a debt discount, and to the change in fair value of its additional consideration of $15 million payable to
   <company id="109409">
    Lundbeck
   </company>
   (related to its acquisition of various injectable products from that company in 2011).
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash flow increased by $31 million in 2013 due to a decline in cash used in trade accounts receivable and inventories.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In addition to regular growth through acquisitions, Akorn is working to increase its internal product development efforts to speed up the time it takes to bring a new product to market (as well as to reduce its dependence on licensing deals and acquisitions).

  <p>
   In 2014 Akon acquired the US NDA rights to Zioptan (a prescription ophthalmic eye drop indicated for reducing elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension) from Merck, Sharp and Dohme Corp., and the NDA rights to Betimol (a prescription ophthalmic eye drop for the reduction of eye pressure in glaucoma patients) from Japan-based

    Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company acquired from Merck the US rights to three branded ophthalmic products (AzaSite, Cosopt and Cosopt PF) for $52.8 million.  It began selling Cosopt and Cosopt PF at the end of 2013 and began selling AzaSite in early 2014. This acquisition allows Akorn to leverage its existing ophthalmic sales force and physician relationships.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2013 Akorn agreed to acquire
   <company id="15851">
    Hi-Tech Pharmacal
   </company>
   for some $640 million. The purchase will expand Akorn's development pipeline, as well as its offerings of generic and branded OTC and prescription products. Hi-Tech Pharmacal makes a number of dosage forms, including liquid, semi-solid, oral, topical, nasal spray, and sterile ointments and gels.

  <p>
   Joseph Yazbeck founded Akorn in Metairie, Louisiana, in 1971; the name was chosen so the firm would appear near the front of alphabetical listings. Akorn initially distributed eye care products from various suppliers. In 1988 the firm went public. In 1989 Yazbeck retired (replaced by John Kapoor), and Akorn bought its first manufacturing facility from Irish drug company Norbrook Holdings; two years later, after product recalls and a push from the FDA to modernize, Akorn closed the facility. The company resumed manufacturing operations in 1992 with the purchase of Taylor Pharmaceuticals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Akorn diversified in 1995, starting a surgical instrument repair unit, and boosted its line of injectable drugs the next year. Akorn moved its headquarters from Louisiana to Illinois in 1997 and introduced a generic version of Merck's antiglaucoma drug Timoptic.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Akorn increased earnings by acquiring eight new products, including worldwide rights to Allergan's Fluress stain. The purchase of a manufacturing facility in New Jersey decreased dependency on outside suppliers. In 1999 Akorn partnered with CIBA Vision to market a generic form of that company's Ocupress glaucoma treatment. In 2000 the company sought permission to begin testing a treatment for age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in elderly people.
  </p>
  <p>
   That same year, the FDA issued a warning about problems at the company's manufacturing facility in Decatur, Illinois. Additional inspections in 2002, 2003, and 2004 revealed other "deviations" at the facility, which the company has since responded to and corrected. These difficulties prevented Akorn from developing new products at Decatur for several years, which had a significant impact on its business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Arthur Przybyl resigned as CEO in 2009. The board then appointed newcomer Raj Rai as CEO in mid-2009.
  </p>
  <p>
   Akorn decided in 2009 to exit the market for flu vaccine distribution. Biologics and vaccines previously accounted for about 40% of Akorn's sales in 2009. The company discontinued the rest of the division's operations (tetanus-diphtheria vaccines) in early 2010. The exit didn't impact Akorn's revenues as it increased sales within its other segments during 2009 and 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company centralized its R&amp;D operations in early 2010 by opening a focused R&amp;D center in Skokie, Illinois; previously the company's internal research was performed at its two manufacturing plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   A major boost in the ophthalmics segment came when Akorn entered the OTC eye care market through the 2011 purchase of
   <company id="106928">
    Advanced Vision Research
   </company>
   for some $26 million in cash. The purchase added such brands as TheraTears and MacuTrition. Akorn is already familiar with the products, having been their primary contract manufacturer for several years. To round out its offerings it plans to manufacture private label eye care products and license new products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's generic injectables division experienced increased demand in 2011 (due to shortages of certain products in the US market), and in response Akorn decided to ride that wave by growing the segment's operations. To expand its portfolio of proprietary branded products, Akorn acquired manufacturing and marketing rights for three injectable drugs from Danish firm
   <company id="147681">
    Lundbeck
   </company>
   for some $50 million that year (plus potential future milestone payments). The drugs include Nembutal, a controversial drug used in lethal injection executions; Cogentin for Parkinson's disease symptoms; and Diuril, a diuretic and antihypertensive medicine. To focus on its most profitable growth offerings, the firm sold its stake in a portfolio of injectable products marketed with Strides Arcolab to
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   To increase its production of injectables, Akorn acquired a compound of contract manufacturing facilities for sterile injectables from India-based Kilitch Drugs in a deal worth some $60 million in 2012. The purchase expandedAkorn's capabilities in emerging international markets, and the firm plans to apply for FDA certification of the facility to boost its US offerings as well. As portions of the India facility are still under construction, the purchase also provided future capacity for additional products, including new ophthalmics and expansion into cancer drugs, in both the US and international markets.
