   Orbotech knows that manufacturing perfection is in the fine, technical details. The company is a supplier of high-speed automated optical inspection (AOI) systems used to identify defects in the printed circuit boards (PCBs), integrated circuit packaging, flat-panel displays, and electronic assemblies found in computers, cell phones, and other communications systems. Through subsidiary Orbograph, it makes character recognition software used by banks to process checks and detect fraud. Orbotech sells its products worldwide, but does most of its business in Asia. Customers have included
   <company id="107576">
    AU Optronics
   </company>
   and
   <company id="120393">
    Chunghwa Picture Tubes
   </company>
   . The company also provides such services as installation, maintenance, and training.

  <p>
   Orbotech traces its roots to Orbot, a company founded in 1981 by Yehuda Bronicki, Yochai Richter, and Zvi Lapidot; William Davidson, billionaire CEO of
   <company id="40191">
    Guardian Industries
   </company>
   and managing partner of the
   <company id="46815">
    Detroit Pistons
   </company>
   , was an early investor and partner.
  </p>
  <p>
   As printed circuit boards became more complex, the demand for quality control (coupled with the growing cost of production) made human inspection nearly impossible, leading to the development of automatic optical inspection (AOI) systems. By 1988 two companies, Orbot and Optrotech (both based in Israel) controlled nearly 85% of the AOI market.
  </p>
  <p>
   After battling it out for years, Orbot and Optrotech (an affiliate of
   <company id="51110">
    Elron Electronic Industries
   </company>
   ) merged in 1992; the combined entity, Orbotech, controlled about 75% of the world market for printed circuit board (PCB) inspection systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 Richter (a founding director of Orbot) was named president and CEO. The following year the company abandoned its attempts to convert its imaging technology for manufacturing circuit boards into applications for graphic arts, shutting down its graphic arts division.
  </p>
  <p>
   Orbotech in 1996 formed a joint venture with
   <company id="56468">
    Jenoptik
   </company>
   , Laser Imaging Systems, to develop laser direct imaging systems for the manufacture of PCBs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the company acquired the Japan-based PCB sales and marketing operations of Toyo Ink Manufacturing, as well as the computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) product line of Toyo's Israeli subsidiary, Electronic Imaging Technologies. Orbotech further strengthened its CAM software offerings that year with the creation of a joint venture (FrontLine P.C.B. Solutions) with
   <company id="102440">
    Valor Computerized Systems
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Orbotech acquired KLA Acrotec, a Japanese designer of AOI systems for flat-panel display production.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company established a venture fund for investing in development-stage high-tech companies. The steep decline in demand in the tech sector that year forced Orbotech to start cutting costs; it announced workforce reductions late in 2001 and salary cuts in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2005 Orbotech acquired the assets of Imarad Imaging Systems, an Israel-based maker of gamma radiation detectors designed for use in nuclear medicine, for $7 million in cash. The company then formed Orbotech Medical Solutions (OMS) to develop solid-state gamma radiation detectors based on the proprietary cadmium zinc telluride crystal-growth technology acquired from Imarad.
  </p>
  <p>
   Orbotech in 2007 acquired 3 D - Danish Diagnostic Development A/S (DDD) for about $39 million in cash, adding new products to its lineup. The firm made gamma cameras for nuclear medicine, primarily marketed in the US. DDD became part of Orbotech's medical imaging group.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 Orbotech acquired
   <company id="47200">
    Photon Dynamics
   </company>
   for about $290 million in cash. The acquisition, the company's largest up to that point in time, broadened Orbotech's portfolio in the flat-panel display (FPD) inspection market. Photon Dynamics became part of Orbotech's FPD Division.
  </p>
  <p>
   Restructuring in response to the faltering world economy in 2009, the company scaled back activities in the assembled PCB business when it stopped developing and marketing assembled PCB equipment. Orbotech reduced its worldwide workforce by about 15% the previous year, trimming management and employee salaries, among other cost-cutting measures.
