   News Corp. divides its operations into five segments -- news and information services, book publishing, cable network programming, digital real estate services, and other. (Its 50% stake in FOXTEL is treated as an equity investment.) The print and digital media publications (news and information services, book publishing) account for the majority of revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   The news and information services segment also includes News America Marketing Group (NAMG), a publisher and distributor of coupons in newspapers and on the SmartSource.com website. NAMG's customers include many of the largest consumer packaged-goods advertisers in the US and Canada. It reaches 74 million households for its freestanding coupon inserts and about 56,000 retail outlets for its in-store advertising.
  </p>
  <p>
   Murdoch moved his Australian TV operations to News Corp. in order to allow the US TV operations to grow as a stand-alone division.

  <p>
   The company's subsidiaries are located in Australia, the UK, and the US. In addition, book publisher HarperCollins has a warehouse in Scotland and Dow Jones runs an office in Hong Kong. North America accounted for 47% of sales during fiscal 2016.

  <p>

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's revenue was $8.29 billion for fiscal 2016, which was a decrease of $341 million (or 4%) compared to News Corporation's fiscal 2015 revenue. The decrease was largely attributed to the sale of  the company's digital education business during the first quarter of fiscal 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   News Corporation's net income was $179 million in fiscal 2016 compared to a net loss of $147 million it suffered for the prior fiscal period. Rebounding from a net loss to a $170 million profit in fiscal 2016 was primarily attributed to a tax benefit of $54 million compared to a tax expense of $185 million during the previous fiscal year.

  <p>
   Splitting the business into separate publishing and entertainment companies allowed each company to pursue uninhibited industry-specific opportunities, benefit from greater financial and operational flexibility, and provide investors with a more targeted investment opportunity.
