   Pure Storage is a pure play in computer storage. The company sells flash storage only and none of those old-school hard disk drives (HDD) which have been the storage devices of choice for decades. Since flash storage offers faster response than HDDs, Pure focuses on customers with needs in virtualization and transaction processing. The company's products include its solid state drives, Flash Array, the software that operates the drives, the Purity Operating System, and Pure1, which provides cloud-based management and support to customers. Like a consumer product company, Pure offers a 30-day, money back guarantee of its products.

   Pure's initial stock offering, made in 2015, raised $425 million. It intends to use the money to strengthen its balance sheet and increase its visibility in the market, which means using some of the proceeds on sales and marketing efforts. The company was founded in 2009.

   Pure has focused on building revenue over making a profit. And revenue has grown by leaps and bigger leaps. For 2016 (ended January), revenue rose 150% to $440 million from $175 million in 2015. Sales were driven by the company's FlashArray//m product that was released in mid-2015 and its 400-Series product.

  <p>
   Growth remains the goal for Pure as it increases spending across the board including jumps for research and development and sales and marketing. The company's loss reached $210 million in 2016, compared to $180 million in 2015.

   The company continues to spend than it takes in, but its negative cash flow fell to $8 million in 2016 from $140 million negative cash flow in 2015.

   Pure is a new company in an emerging market. Not only does it offer a relatively new technology, it does so without an established record. While it has gained more than 1,700 customers since it started selling flash storage in 2012, it faces a formidable band of established competitors. They include

    Cisco

   ,
   <company id="13193">
    Dell

   <company id="56726">
    Lenovo
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="47100">
    NetApp
   </company>
   . Those companies are technology brand names and they offer a wider range of storage products including HDDs and hybrid systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pure spends heavily to get word out about it and its technology. The company plows increasing amounts of money into sales and marketing and research development. The company has more than 200 patents.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company touts the ease of installation and use of its storage products. Hardware and software can be upgraded with less disturbance than with the 'forklift upgrades' needed for HDDs. It calls its incremental upgrades of hardware and software "evergreen storage." Pure offers flat fee-service as well as loyalty upgrade incentives as part of a program it calls Forever Flash. In a related program, dubbed Love Your Flash, the company offers a 30-day, money back guarantee for unsatisfied customers.
