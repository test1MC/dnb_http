   Once a machine toolmaker, Milacron has retooled to focus on plastics processing technologies and industrial fluids. Its plastics machinery unit makes injection molding and extrusion processing equipment used to produce dashboards, decking, and other products. Other units include Uniloy (blow molding systems), DME (parts such as mold bases for plastics machinery), CIMCOOL (coolants, lubricants, and cleaners for metal grinding, machining, and stamping), and Milacron Precision Machining Manufacturing (parts for wind power, oil and gas, and heavy equipment). Milacron went public in 2015.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 IPO.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Milacron went public in 2015 and raised $286 million in proceeds from its IPO. It intends to use the money to repay debt.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   North America is Milacron's core market. It operates about 35 facilities in the US, Canada, India, China, Germany, Belgium, Brazil, Mexico, Korea, and the Netherlands and provides support in 70 countries.
  </p>

  <p>
   Milacron's assets include its position as one of world's largest suppliers of injection molding machinery. Its extruders tout a range of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and plastic composite manufacturing capabilities, serving both commercial and residential construction applications. The company also boasts a leadership position in developing technology to help reduce customers' per part production costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In blow molding, Milacron is a dominant supplier of industrial blow molding equipment for a slew of products, from toys to furniture, car components, and shipping containers. Moreover, in North America, the company is the go-to source for mold base components, nozzles, screw tips, and more.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates through five businesses: Milacron Plastics Machinery (injection molding, extrusion, and blow molding);Mold-Masters (advanced hot runner systems, temperature controllers and auxiliary equipment); DME Mold (roducts for use with plastics machinery, including mold bases, mold components, hot and cold runner systems, and control systems); Milacron Aftermarket (process and machine auditing, quality replacement parts including industry-leading barrels and screws, machine rebuilding and upgrades, and technical training); and CIMCOOL Fluid Technology (fluids for machining, grinding, stamping, metal-forming, cleaning and specialty applications).

  <p>
   Milacron sells its products through direct sales, catalogs, and independent sellers.

  <p>
   Milacron is attempting to sell its products to markets farther East, a switch from its traditional targeting of customers in industrialized economies -- North America and Europe -- where plastics processing plays a major role in manufacturing most goods. Tight access to credit hampered blow molding and extruder purchases, because big equipment carries big price tags. With the economic tide turning and manufacturers cautiously investing in new machinery, the company has recognized an increase in orders for plastic parts.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to better assist its customers on the West Coast, in 2014 Milacron opened a new 17,000 sq. ft. technical center in Irvine, California. It also has announced plans to open a Milacron High Impact Technical Center (HIT) in Southlake, Texas, with two more regional centers in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of the company's Aftermarket PART-nership program, that year the company introduced a new technology package -- the Interactive Parts Catalog, Interactive Technical Manual, and Remote Monitoring Services -- available to engineers, purchasers, and maintenance staff.

  <p>
   To broaden its product portfolio, Milacron often uses acquisitions. In 2014 it obtained Industrial Machine Sales and its sister company, Precise Plastics Machinery. Industrial Machine Sales is based in Southlake, Texas, and it serves that state, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, New Mexico, and the northern border of Mexico. The Southlake facility became a Milacron High Impact Technical Center (HIT).
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it also acquired Kortec, a leading supplier of co-injection technology products for the packaging industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Milacron acquired Mold-Masters, a global hot-runner manufacturer with operations in North America, Europe, and Asia, in a transaction valued at $975 million. It also that year boosted its extrusion services with the acquisition of American Extrusion Services, of Springboro, Ohio.

  <p>
   In 2012 Milacron was acquired by affiliates of
   <company id="153771">
    CCMP Capital Advisors LLC
   </company>
   . The company benefits from CCMP Capital's experience investing in and supporting the growth of plastics and industrial companies. As a result, Milacron expects to expand its market share, extend global reach, and invest in technologies to meet customer needs around the world over the long term with CCMP Capitals' renewed financial stability and CCMP's support.

  <p>
   In 1874 George Mueller inherited a Cincinnati machine shop and brought on his friend Fred Holz as a partner. Two years later they built a screw-making machine and formed the Cincinnati Screw and Tap Company. In 1887 Frederick A. Geier bought an interest in the company and refocused it on milling machines; the company became Cincinnati Milling Machine Company in 1889. By the early 1900s both Mueller and Holz had sold their interests and retired.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1911 the company completed what was then the world's largest milling plant on the outskirts of the Queen City. Post-WWI excess production caused the company to reduce its workforce by 75% in the 1920s. It weathered the Depression by boosting export sales. Geier died in 1934, and his son, Frederick V., succeeded him. The company went public in 1946.
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the next decade the business diversified into cutting fluids, grinding wheels, lathes, and specialty chemicals and plastics. In the 1950s and 1960s it was molding plastic for everything from radios to bowling-alley seats. The company adopted the name Cincinnati Milacron in 1970 ("milacron" means "highest precision"). Frederick V. retired in 1976, and his nephew, James Geier, eventually succeeded him as chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cincinnati Milacron sold its specialty chemical unit in 1980 to focus on industrial products, machine tools, and plastics machinery. The 1980s recession decimated the capital goods market. The company reported its first loss in 1983 and cut employment by a third. In 1986 it formed the Wolfpack special projects group, which made recommendations for improving existing products and helped the company regain profitability in the early 1990s, although excess machine tool production led to a $100 million loss in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 Cincinnati Milacron acquired FM Maschinenbau (injection-molding equipment) and GTE Valenite (industrial metal-cutting tools). It consolidated its US machine tool operations and relocated production to Cincinnati the next year. The acquisitions of Krupp Widia and Talbot Holdings in 1995 greatly increased its market position in metal-cutting tools. Cincinnati Milacron bought D-M-E Company (mold bases for the injection-molding industry) from
   <company id="10180">
    Fairchild
   </company>
   in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   Buying continued in 1997 and 1998 with the purchases of Minnesota Twist Drill (high-speed twist drills), Data Flute CNC (solid-carbide end mills), Autojectors (plastics injection-molding equipment), Manpo Chemicals (metalworking fluids, South Korea), and Northern Supply (regional catalog distribution). Cincinnati Milacron paid
   <company id="10825">
    Johnson Controls
   </company>
   $190 million for Uniloy, the US's largest producer of plastics blow-molding equipment. After the spending, the company sold its oldest business -- machine tools -- to industrial tech company UNOVA (which was renamed
   <company id="55096">
    Intermec Inc.
   </company>
   in 2006) for $180 million. The company then dropped "Cincinnati" from its name, although it continues to be based in the famed city of Porkopolis.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company purchased Akron Extruders, a maker of single-screw plastic extrusions, and Ontario Heater and Supply and Rite-Tek Canada, both distributors of plastic maintenance, repair, and operating supplies. The following year, the company suffered from reduced sales, reporting its first annual loss in eight years. It responded by initiating plant closures and layoffs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company decided to sell its Valenite metal-cutting tool business to
   <company id="90917">
    Sandvik
   </company>
   for $175 million in 2002. Other divestitures that year included the sale of Werkö and Widia for €188 million and the disposals of Minnesota Twist Drill in 2003 and Cimform Grinding Wheels in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company responded to lower sales and earnings by consolidating Plastic Technologies facilities in Europe and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   A global downturn in the manufacturing and construction industries in 2008 crushed Milacron along with other suppliers of injection presses used to manufacture everyday plastic products. Milacron was forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March 2009. The company secured $135 million in debtor-in-possession loans, which kept its worldwide operations from coming to a halt. Milacron emerged in mid-2009 after hedge funds Avenue Capital Group and DDJ Capital Management, owners of its senior notes, purchased the troubled company for about $175 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company launched a new facility in Querétaro, Mexico.
