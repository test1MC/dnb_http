   Halozyme Therapeutics is searching for cures through a number of "ologys" by developing treatments for use in endocrinology, oncology, and dermatology fields. It is also creating products for the drug delivery market. Its Hylenex recombinant is used as an adjuvant for drug and fluid infusions. Most of Halozyme's products and candidates (including Hylenex) are based on rHuPH20, its patented recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme, while its lead cancer program is PEGPH20, which targets solid tumors. Halozyme partners with such pharmaceuticals as
   <company id="41787">
    Roche
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="100382">
    Janssen
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="163373">
    Baxalta
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="162908">
    AbbVie
   </company>
   for its ENHANZE drug delivery platform, which enables biologics and small molecule compounds to be delivered subcutaneously.

  <p>
   The firm's commercial products are marketed through distribution agreements, primarily in the US and Europe. It also receives revenue from its development partnerships. Halozyme has a development and marketing agreement with
   <company id="10188">
    Baxter International
   </company>
   to develop an under-the-skin delivery technology for Baxter's Gammagard Liquid immunodeficiency treatment using Halozyme's Enhanze platform. The two companies did partner on sales of Hylenex as well, however, in 2011 Baxter returned its marketing rights back to Halozyme. Halozyme intends to take advantage of the inroads already made by Baxter to commercialize the product further.

  <p>
   Halozyme is headquartered in and has research facilities in San Diego, California.
  </p>
  <p>
   Switzerland accounts for about 60% of the firm's revenue, and the US accounts for about 40%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Roche accounts for more than half of Halozyme's total revenue, while Janssen accounts for about 20%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Integrated Commercial Solutions, a division of
   <company id="40016">
    AmerisourceBergen
   </company>
   , is the exclusive distributor for Hylenex recombinant in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company employs outside vendors such as advertising agencies, market research firms, and marketing firms to help support its commercial activities.

   With the exception of 2012, revenue has been on the rise for the past five years. It rose 37% to $75 million in 2014 as product sales and royalty earnings increased. Bulk sales of rHuPH20 for the firm's collaboration with Roche grew by nearly $10 million that year, while Hylenex sales grew by more than $4 million. Royalties primarily increased due to sales of Roche's Herceptin SC (subcutaneous), which was launched in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   Halozyme has operated at a loss every year since its inception but, thanks to the higher revenue in 2014, that loss declined to $68 million (versus $83 million in 2013). At the end of 2014, its accumulated deficit totaled some $450.4 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow dropped 2% to $48 million in 2014.

  <p>
   Halozyme's two primary goals are to continue developing its PEGPH20 oncology program and entering more collaborations for its Enhanze technology. For instance, Halozyme has a collaboration with Roche to apply its ENHANZE technology to Roche's therapeutic biological compounds in areas including oncology and immunology. And in 2015, the company signed a collaboration agreement with
   <company id="56282">
    Eisai
   </company>
   to investigate Eisai's eribulin and PEGPH20 in metastatic breast cancer.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has made a number of related moves in the past couple of years. Also in 2015, it signed a global collaboration and license agreement with AbbVie to develop and commercialize products that combine Halozyme's ENHANZE platform with AbbVie compounds. In 2014, it entered into a similar agreement with Janssen which will focus on the rHuPH20 enzyme and Janssen's proprietary biologics.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, Baxter launched HyQvia, a subcutaneous immunoglobulin treatment for patients with primary immunodeficiency, in the US. Also that year, Roche launched the subcutaneous formulation of MabThera in Europe for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Both of those treatments utilize Halozyme's rHuPH20 enzyme.
  </p>
  <p>
   Halozyme's proprietary Ultrafast Insulin program combines the company's enzyme with mealtime insulins to increase absorption, speed of action, and glycemic control. Additional candidates target bladder cancer, solid tumors, and aesthetic dermatology conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2014, the company terminated a collaboration agreement with
   <company id="52432">
    ViroPharma
   </company>
   and a license agreement with
   <company id="163060">
    Intrexon
   </company>
   .
