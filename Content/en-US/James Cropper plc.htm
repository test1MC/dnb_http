   James Cropper (JC) doesn't cut corners when it comes to making paper. The company's largest unit, Paper Products (82% of sales), makes uncoated paper, manila board, book binding papers, packaging paper, and text and cover papers. Other operations produce display board and mount board, while Technical Fibre Products manufactures industrial insulation, composite materials, non-woven mats, and products used for fire protection. The UK is its largest market, accounting for more than 50% of the company's sales. JC traces its historical roots all the way back to 1845.

  <p>
   JC has its operations in over 50 countries worldwide, with the majority of its sales offices located in Europe, China, and the US. The UK accounts for 53% of net sales. Other major markets include Europe (18%), the Americas (17%), and Asia (9%). Australasia and Africa account for the remainder.

  <p>
   From 2014 to 2015 JC's revenue decreased by 2% due to a decline in exports. The company also experienced the exit of a key customer and a planned exit of a non-strategic line of display board business, which negatively affected its paper business. The Paper Products segment declined by 4% in 2015. This was offset by a 11% spike in Technical Fiber Products sales, resulting from growth from the aerospace, defense, industrial and infrastructure sectors, particularly across the China and UK markets.

  <p>
   JC is focused on growth in new and existing businesses through product enhancement and global expansion especially across the key markets of Germany, France, and Spain for the paper industry and China and Russia for TFP products. Adhering to this strategy, the company in 2014 opened a new China office in Guangzhou. The new office is registered by the name James Cropper (Guangzhou) Trading Co. Ltd.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout 2014, the company's Technical Fiber Products (TFP) division doubled its current production capacity with the introduction of a third manufacturing line, which comes in response to increasing demand for TFP's innovative nonwovens across all markets.
