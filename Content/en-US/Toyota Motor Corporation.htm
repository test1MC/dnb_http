   Toyota Motor, among the world's largest automotive manufacturers by revenue, designs and manufactures a diverse product line-up that ranges from subcompacts to luxury and sports vehicles to SUVs, trucks, minivans, and buses. Its vehicles are produced either with combustion or hybrid engines, as with the Prius. Toyota's subsidiaries also manufacture vehicles:

   produces mini-vehicles, while
   <company id="56932">
    Hino Motors

   Toyota divides its operations into the three segments of automotive (90% of total sales), financial services (5%) and other (5%). Automotive is obviously Toyota's bread and butter; the segment makes passenger and commercial vehicles, minivans, trucks and related parts. Its less known financial services segment provides financing to dealers and their customers for the lease or purchase of Toyota vehicles.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Toyota maintains a vast geographical reach, selling to almost 190 countries and regions through 550 consolidated subsidiaries and some 200 affiliated companies. Almost 55% of its sales come from Asia (Japan counts for more than 40%), while North America generates around 30% of total sales. Countries in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Oceania, and Latin America account for the remainder.
  </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
   Sales and Marketers
  </p>
        <p>
   Toyota sells its products mainly through dealers, distributors, and sales channels.
  </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" />
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Toyota's revenues jumped 4% from 2015 to 2016 due to a 14% spike in financial services revenue and a 4% bump in automotive revenue. The company also experienced a 14% increase in North American revenue due primarily to an increase of 124,000 vehicle unit sales compared with the prior fiscal year. This was fueled by favorable market conditions coupled with strong sales of the RAV4, NX, and other car models. Despite the overall growth, Toyota sold 8.7 million units in 2016, down from the almost 9 million units it sold in 2015.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Toyota's growth strategy is centered around global market penetration. To fulfill this goal, Toyota ensures that it offers products for every market segment. For example, the company makes and offers sedans, trucks, SUVs, luxury vehicles, and other product lines for every type of customer.
  </p>
        <p>
   Toyota is also focused on producing electric vehicles amid the strengthening of regulations around increasing the use of zero emission vehicles. It has created an in-house company dedicated solely to this product line and plans to start mass production of its new electric vehicles by 2020.
  </p>
        <p>
   Like its competitors, Toyota is also beefing up its Chinese operations by joining forces with local automotive players. With its partner
   <company id="140689">
    China FAW Group Corporation
   </company>
   , Toyota builds nine models, including Land Cruisers and Corollas, in the country.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2016, Toyota acquired the remaining stake of 49% of Japanese carmaker Daihatsu. The company plans for the deal to help strengthen cooperation by integrating development and production technologies in the categories of subcompact cars and eco-friendly vehicles.

        <p>
   In 1926 Sakichi Toyoda founded Toyoda Automatic Loom Works. In 1930 he sold the rights to the loom he invented and gave the proceeds to his son Kiichiro Toyoda to begin an automotive business. Kiichiro opened an auto shop within the loom works in 1933. When protectionist legislation (1936) improved prospects for Japanese automakers, Kiichiro split off the car department, took it public (1937), and changed its name to Toyota.
  </p>
        <p>
   During WWII the company made military trucks, but financial problems after the war caused Toyota to reorganize in 1950. Its postwar commitment to R&amp;D paid off with the launch of the four-wheel-drive Land Cruiser (1951); full-sized Crown (1955); and the small Corona (1957).
  </p>
        <p>
            <company id="43972">

   </company>
   debuted the Toyopet Crown in the US in 1957, but it proved underpowered for the US market. Toyota had better luck with the Corona in 1965 and with the Corolla (which became the best-selling car of all time) in 1968. By 1970 Toyota was the world's fourth largest carmaker.
  </p>
        <p>
   Toyota expanded rapidly in the US. During the 1970s the oil crisis caused demand for fuel-efficient cars, and Toyota was there to grab market share from US makers. In 1975 Toyota displaced
   <company id="41853">
    Volkswagen
   </company>
   as the US's #1 auto importer. Toyota began auto production in the US in 1984 through
   <company id="40345">
    NUMMI
   </company>
   , its joint venture with
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   . The Lexus line was launched in the US in 1989.
  </p>
        <p>
   Because of European restrictions on Japanese auto imports until 2000, Toyota's European expansion slowed. Toyota responded in 1992 by agreeing to distribute cars in Japan for Volkswagen and also by establishing an engine plant (later moved to full auto production) in the UK.
  </p>
        <p>
   The SUV mania of the 1990s spurred Toyota's introduction of luxury minivans and light trucks. Hiroshi Okuda, a 40-year veteran with Toyota and the first person from outside the Toyoda family to run the firm, succeeded Tatsuro Toyoda as president in 1995. The next year Toyota consolidated its North American production units into Cincinnati-based Toyota Motor Manufacturing North America.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1997 Toyota introduced the Prius, a hybrid electric- and gas-powered car. The next year Toyota boosted its stake in affiliate
   <company id="56355">
    Daihatsu Motor
   </company>
   (mini-vehicles) to about 51% and started Toyota Mapmaster (51% owned), to make map databases for car navigation systems. Okuda became chairman in 1999, replacing Shoichiro Toyoda, and Fujio Cho became president (later chairman). Also that year Toyota agreed to form a joint venture with
   <company id="41753">
    Isuzu Motors
   </company>
   to manufacture buses.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2000 Toyota launched the WiLL Vi, a sedan aimed at young people. It announced that it was building an online replacement parts marketplace with
   <company id="51649">
    i2 Technologies
   </company>
   and formed a financial services company (Toyota Financial Service) and a brokerage firm (Toyota Financial Services Securities Corp.). Toyota also bought a 5% stake in
   <company id="54040">
    Yamaha Motor
   </company>
   (the world's #2 motorcycle maker) and raised its stake in truck maker
   <company id="56932">
    Hino Motors
   </company>
   from about 20% to around 34%.
  </p>
        <p>
   International developments included Toyota's agreement with the Chinese government to produce passenger cars for sale in China built by Tianjin Toyota Motor Corp., a joint venture between Chinese carmaker Tianjin Automobile Xiali and Toyota. In 2001 Toyota opened a plant in France. Later that year Toyota also increased its stake in Hino Motors to 50%. With partners
   <company id="121195">
    Toyoda Gosei
   </company>
   and Horie Metal Co., Ltd., Toyota formed a joint venture in 2002 to manufacture resin fuel tank systems. In 2004 Toyota forged a joint venture agreement with Guangzhou Automobile Group to build engines in China. The following year Toyota established 14 Lexus dealerships in China. The company began joint car production in Europe with
   <company id="41827">
    Peugeot S.A.
   </company>
   in 2005. Also in 2005 Toyota bought just under 9% of
   <company id="52361">
    Fuji Heavy Industries
   </company>
   -- the Japanese maker of Subaru passenger vehicles. The two companies began production of Toyota Camrys at Fuji Heavy Industries' underutilized
   <company id="120065">

   </company>
   plant in 2007.
  </p>
        <p>
   After suffering through the Great Recession from 2008 to 2010, Toyota faced another unforeseen crisis. In March 2011 its business suffered unexpectedly from the Great East Japan Earthquake, which triggered a deadly tsunami and subsequent nuclear crisis that forced
   <company id="41887">
    Tokyo Electric Power
   </company>
   (Tepco) to shut down reactors at two nuclear power plants and five other conventional power plants. The events forced manufacturers to reduce their output or move production to other regions. Toyota, along with its rivals (
   <company id="41879">
    Nissan
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41867">
    Honda
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41860">
    Mazda
   </company>
   ), were forced to close their factories days after the devastation.
