    Land O'Lakes
   </company>

   WhiteWave's coffee creamers and beverages unit was its biggest revenue producer in 2015, accounting for 27% of revenue. The unit that sells foods and beverages from plants brought in 24% of revenue with premium dairy goods generating 20% of revenue. The fresh foods and European units split the remaining 30% of revenue almost evenly.

  <p>
   Geographically, the company's North American business, which accounted for nearly 86% of sales in 2015, offers plant-based foods and beverages, coffee creamers and beverages, and premium dairy goods. The European business generated about 14% of revenues through sales of plant-based foods and beverages in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK, and less so in France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, WhiteWave poured into China through a joint venture with China Mengniu Dairy Company Limited, a Chinese dairy company. Through the JV, the companies make, market, and sell premium plant-based beverages in China. The joint venture, a 49/51 split between WhiteWave and Mengniu, sells under the Silk ZhiPuMoFang brand name with available in several major Chinese markets. They include almond milk and walnut milk beverages in single-serve and multi-pack formats.

   WhiteWave maintained robust revenue growth in 2015 with a 14% increase to nearly $3.9 billion from $3.4 billion in 2014. The three contributors to the Americas Foods and Beverages unit grew in 2015, paced by a 29% increase ($204 million) in the sale of plant-based foods and drinks. Acquisition contributed to the growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue increase led to a rising tide of profit for WhiteWave in 2015, when it posted a 20% gain to $168 million from $140 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations also increased in 2015, reaching $315 million, compared to $284 million in 2014.

   In 2015, WhiteWave acquired Sequel Naturals, which owns the Vega brand and has been a pioneer in developing plant-based nutrition products, for some $553.6 million. This acquisition extended the Company's plant-based foods and beverages platform into nutritional powders and bars.
  </p>
  <p>
   In another 2015 deal, WhiteWave bought EIEIO Inc., which has owned the Magicow brand and other brands, for $40.2 million. The acquisition expands WhiteWave's portfolio of bulk coffee creamer and flavor dispensing products and provided new product capabilities to support growth in away-from-home channel.
