   Pratt Industries (USA) doesn't mill around when it comes to recycling and caring for the environment. The company rivals the world's largest manufacturers of recycled paper and packaging and claims to be the 5th largest box manufacturer in the US and the world's largest, privately-held 100% recycled paper and packaging company. Pratt has a handful of operating divisions: recycling, mills, corrugating, converting, displays, packaging systems, and national accounts. Its products, which include container board and corrugated sheets, are sold to clients such as

   Pratt has strategically located its manufacturing facilities to reduce freight time and cost and to provide regional design and account management support. The locations enable it to react quickly and decisively to meet the needs of customers.

   In 2015 Pratt Industries broke ground on its new $52 million corrugated box factory in Beloit, Wisconsin. The 350,000 sq. ft. facility, due for start-up in early 2016, will sit on a 56-acre site and produce 600 tons of recycled boxes a day at capacity.

  <p>
   In 2015 the company improved its footprint through the purchase of California-based food and agricultural packaging company, Robert Mann Packaging (RMP). Pratt paid $60 million for the privately-owned RMP group which has $150 million in annual sales and more than a dozen facilities in the western US and Mexico, including a 350,000 square-foot box-making plant in Salinas, California. The deal gave the company a nationwide footprint throughout the US with manufacturing sites stretching from New York to the West Coast.
