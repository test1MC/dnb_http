   Griffin Industries takes what no one else wants to deal with and renders it useful. The Kentucky company collects and recycles a variety of items, such as inedible scraps and waste from meat-processing plants and grocery stores, used cooking oils, waste from restaurants and bakeries, and even dead farm animals. It turns these into animal feed, fertilizer, tanned leather, solvents, industrial oils and fats, and alternative fuel for vehicles. Griffin operates in 18 states and markets its products worldwide. A wholly owned subsidiary of

    Darling International
   </company>
   , Griffin was founded in 1943 by John and Rosellen Griffin, whose five sons owned and operated the rendering company prior to its purchase.

        <p>
   Griffin was purchased by rival renderer Darling International, based in Texas, in late 2010. The $840 million deal has given Darling a boost in the southeastern US, a leg up in the development of biofuels, and access to Griffin's owned fleet of ocean-going vessels used to export its products. For Griffin, the transaction has given it an extended reach nationwide and Darling's deeper pockets.

   With nearly 60 locations across 18 US states, Kentucky-based Griffin operates more than half of its locations in Florida, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas. It markets its products worldwide.

   Griffin's operations reach nationwide. Its dozens of plants recycle billions of pounds of material annually. The company's known for its expertise in recycling animal and bakery by-product and restaurant grease. Its Bakery Feeds division recycles inedible bakery waste from bread, dough, pasta, crackers, cereal, bagels, sweet goods, and snack chips. The waste is cleaned, mixed, and milled to produce Griffin's Cookie Meal brand ingredients for animal feed.
  </p>
        <p>
   It boasts alliances with more than 30 affiliates, such as ASTM International, Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary System, Biscuit &amp; Cracker Manufacturers Association, Cookie &amp; Snack Baker's Association, Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, Pet Food Institute, and state restaurant associations.

   Producing alternative fuel has been part of the company's market diversification strategy. Griffin Industries' Bio G-3000 brand of biodiesel fuel is made from soybean oil and recycled restaurant grease, thus allowing it to expand its customer base by offering more than the traditional rendering company's products and services, such as cleaning restaurant grease traps and generally ridding its customers of their unwanted effluvia.

   Environmental stewardship is also important to Griffin Industries. Its Nature Safe division manufactures fertilizers from

   -approved ingredients containing no waste by-products, such as feathers, bone, meat, fish, poultry, and blood meal. Nature Safe is sold to golf courses, sports turf maintenance companies, organic farmers, and businesses in the horticulture, lawn care, landscaping, and nursery sectors. It also makes non-toxic VersaGen brand methyl esters, which can replace mineral spirits and other toxic solvents; Nature Safe natural and organic fertilizers; and Fat for Fuel products, which can be used in industrial boilers and driers.
