   It's rare when the illness and cure are one in the same; but in AMAG Pharmaceuticals' case, iron is the problem
   <em>
    and
   </em>
   the solution. The biopharmaceutical company is focused on the development and commercialization of an iron compound to treat iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Its primary money maker is Makena, a drug a drug to reduce the risk of pre-term births. Another product, Feraheme Injection treats IDA in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). AMAG sells Feraheme in the US and Canada through its own sales force. AMAG's other product, MuGard Mucoadhesive Oral Wound Rinse, is used in the management of oral mucositis; it is also marketed in the US.

  <p>
   Makena, which accounted for some 60% of revenues in 2015, is exclusively marketed by
   <company id="16711">
    Lumara Health
   </company>
   . AMAG gained Makena in late 2014 when it acquired Lumara's Maternal Health operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   AMAG also owns Cord Blood Registry, a newborn stem cell bank. Cord Blood Registry holds more than half of the US' privately stored cord units; it partners with academic institutions to evaluate the use of stem cells in treating autism, cerebral palsy, and other diseases and conditions.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's products are sold in the US and Canada.

  <p>
   Makena is distributed through specialty pharmacies, specialty distributors, and home infusion companies; customers include health care providers, hospitals, government entities, and health groups. The company sells Feraheme to health care providers in hospitals, hematology and oncology centers, and nephrology clinics.
  </p>
  <p>
   AMAG markets its product outside of North America primarily through its alliance with
   <company id="56037">
    Takeda
   </company>
   . It also use sales call channel to market MuGard and sells to wholesalers and specialty pharmacies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015
   <company id="40016">
    AmerisourceBergen
   </company>
   accounted for 25% of AMAG's revenues; Takeda, 12%;and
   <company id="10977">
    McKesson
   </company>
   , 11%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   After seeing flat revenues through 2013 and a nice jump in 2014, revenue spiked more than 200% to $418 million in 2015. That growth was driven by sales of the recently acquired Makena as well as higher sales (and selling price) of Feraheme. The 2015 acquisition of Cord Blood Registry also boosted service revenue. Finally, deferred revenue related to the termination of an agreement with Takeda in 2015 contributed to the dramatic rise.
  </p>
  <p>
   AMAG was losing money until 2014, when it made a profit of $136 million. However, despite the spike in revenue in 2015, net income fell 76% to $33 billion that year as operating expenses (including acquisition-related costs) rose. Income tax provisions also impacted the bottom line.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations roses 741% to $96 million that year due to several non-cash operating items, including deferred income taxes, equity-based compensation expense, and inventory write-downs.
  </p>

  <p>
   AMAG is looking to expand its portfolio organically or through the acquisition of additional specialty pharmaceutical products or companies. It is seeking complementary products that will leverage its commercial infrastructure and focus on hematology and oncology centers, hospital infusion centers or other sites of care where iron is administered intravenously.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company entered the maternal health market when it acquired specialty pharmaceutical
   <company id="16711">
    Lumara Health
   </company>
   . The following year, it entered an agreement with Velo, gaining the option to buy the rights to an orphan drug candidate that is being developed to treat severe preeclampsia in pregnant women.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company pours much of its research and development funds into growing applications and markets for Feraheme, since the drug has seen faces challenges in the US due to changes in the way dialysis services are reimbursed by programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The changes make it less likely that dialysis providers would choose to use Feraheme, so AMAG expects the majority of demand for Feraheme in the US to come from the non-dialysis CKD market.
  </p>
  <p>
   To diversify its uses, Feraheme is being tested to treat iron deficiency in a broad range of patients for whom oral iron treatments don't work including women with abnormal uterine bleeding, patients with cancer or gastrointestinal diseases, and post-partum women.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, AMAG terminated its existing development and commercialization agreement with Takeda, which held the rights for Faraheme in the European Union and Switzerland. AMAG retained the worldwide development and commercialization rights for the drug.

  <p>
   In 2015 AMAG broadened its maternal health business with the $700 million acquisition of Cord Blood Registry, a firm that collects and stores umbilical cord blood and tissue stem cell samples.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In a move to try to diversify its product base, AMAG agreed to buy
   <company id="99832">
    Allos Therapeutics
   </company>
   (maker of cancer drug Folotyn) in mid-2011 in a deal worth about $686 million; however, the deal was terminated later that year. In the midst of its negotiations with Allos Therapeutics, AMAG received a proposal from one of its minority investors, MSMB Capital Management, which sought to acquire AMAG for some $378 million. MSMB opposed the Allos transaction, believing that the company's current strategy was not beneficial to its stockholders. AMAG's board disagreed and rejected MSMB's bid, choosing instead to continue with plans to acquire Allos. Ultimately though, the Allos transaction was voted down by AMAG's shareholders.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following the failure of the Allos deal, AMAG returned to its previous growth strategy, which hinges upon gaining approval for additional uses of Feraheme in more countries and regions. The drug is currently approved for use as an IV iron replacement therapy in both the dialysis and non-dialysis CKD markets.
