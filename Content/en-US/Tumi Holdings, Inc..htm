        <p>
   Tumi's business is divided into four operating segments: Direct-to-Consumer North America, Direct-to-Consumer International, Indirect-to-Consumer North America, and Indirect-to-Consumer International.
  </p>
        <p>
   The Direct-to-Consumer North America segment sells products directly to consumers through a network of company-owned retail stores consisting of full-price stores and outlet stores located in high-end retail malls or street venues. It also sells products to consumers through its e-commerce website. The segment generates almost half of revenue.
  </p>
        <p>
   The Indirect-to-Consumer North America segment sells to wholesale customers, including specialty luggage retailers, prestige department stores, and business-to-business channels. Wholesale customers also sell Tumi products through their own e-commerce websites. Tumi also sells products in partner stores operated by local distributors or retailers that carry only Tumi products and are governed by strict operating guidelines dictated by Tumi. It accounts for a fifth of revenue.
  </p>
        <p>
   The Direct-to-Consumer International segment sells directly to consumers through a network of company-owned full-price and outlet stores in high-end street venues and select malls in international locations. Tumi sells products directly to consumers through its e-commerce website. It brings in about 6% of revenue.
  </p>
        <p>
   The Indirect-to-Consumer International segment sells products through wholesale distribution channels across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa; the Asia-Pacific region; and Central and South America. As part of this business, products are sold through partner stores operated by local distributors or retailers that carry only Tumi products and are governed by strict operating guidelines dictated by Tumi. It also operates concessions in department stores throughout Europe and the Middle East. (Many Tumi wholesale customers also operate their own e-commerce websites to peddle Tumi-branded products.) The segment is responsible for about a quarter of revenue.
