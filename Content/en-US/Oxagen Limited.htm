   Oxagen wants patients with asthma to be able to breathe new life. Founded in 1997, the privately held biopharmaceutical company is developing a pipeline of drug candidates to treat inflammatory and respiratory diseases. Oxagen has a number of candidates in preclinical and clinical research stages for ailments including asthma, allergic conjunctivitis (itchy, red eyes), and allergic rhinitis (nasal inflammation). The company seeks collaborations and licensing deals with other pharmaceutical companies to commercialize its products. It is partnering with with Eleventa to develop and commercialize its lead compound, asthma treatment OC000459, for the Russian and CIS markets.

  <p>
   Oxagen raises capital to fund its R&amp;D operations through private financing rounds with venture capital firms. Proceeds are used to expand the development-stage company's clinical and pre-clinical stage portfolio, as well as to advance clinical trials on its lead project.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is pushing to establish a presence in Russia and its neighboring countries, where 4% to 8% of the population suffers from asthma. It is working with firm Eleventa (owned by Maxwell Biotech) to bring OC000459, a once-daily oral treatment of asthma and allergic conjunctivitis, to the Russian and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) markets. The drug is pending approval from Russian regulatory authorities.
