   Pioneer's sales in North America have risen steadily in recent years driven by increasing car sales, which spur demand for its car audio products, and the improving economy. In fiscal 2014 (ended March), sales in North America totaled $938.7 million, an increase of 8% versus the prior year. Sales or car audio products increased, as did sales of home electronics.
