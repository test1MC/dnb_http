   Like others in the power wheelchair industry, Pride Mobility is dealing with government regulations aimed at reducing Medicare costs, such as reduced reimbursement rates and stricter coverage standards for mobility products. To help its dealers cope with the changes (particularly the Medicare reimbursement cuts), Pride Mobility offers a number of services to its buyers, including reimbursement consultation and alternative payment plans. It has even inked deals with companies like Creek Ridge Capital, a vendor leasing company, to offer private-label leasing programs to its dealers. In 2014 it partnered with Navitas Lease Corp. to offer financing.
