   A large part of MKS Instruments' strategy involves acquisitions. And it started 2016 off with the biggest acquisition in its history. It agreed to acquire Newport Corp. for $980 million. The addition of Newport's laser business provides MKS Instrument an entry into research, health, and life sciences markets. It would have combined revenue of $1.4 billion and net income of more than $150 million.

   In 2015 the company acquired Precisive, a developer of optical analyzers based on Tunable Filter Spectroscopy (TFS), for $13 million for the process and environmental markets. The acquisition target in 2014 was Granville-Phillips, a division of Brooks Automation Inc. That $86 million deal added to MKS Instruments' vacuum measurement and control instruments portfolio.
