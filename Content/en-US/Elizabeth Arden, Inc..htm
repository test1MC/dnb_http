   Elizabeth Arden products are sold in more than 120 countries through 50,000-plus retail locations worldwide. About 45% of the company's sales come from foreign markets, led by the UK, which has shrunk over the last few years, followed by growth in Australia, Canada, and South Africa.

   Elizabeth Arden divides its business between North America and International activities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Contributing 57% of 2014 revenue, the North America segment sells Elizabeth Arden's lineup to department stores, mass retailers, and distributors in the US, Canada, and Puerto Rico. It includes Elizabeth Arden namesake retail outlets and e-tail business, and some 50 Red Door beauty salons operated by privately-held Red Door Spa Holdings. As part of its agreement with the salons, Elizabeth Arden charges the salons a licensing fee based on sales of its namesake products and for use of its Elizabeth Arden and Red Door trademarks.
  </p>
  <p>
   The International segment drives the sale of owned and licensed brands beyond North America to perfumeries, boutiques, department stores, travel retail outlets, and distributors.

   Elizabeth Arden devoted fewer dollars to advertising expenses in 2014, logging $367.8 million that year, down from $414.1 million in 2013 and $353.1 million in 2012.

  <p>
   Elizabeth Arden logged $1.16 billion in revenue in fiscal 2014 (ended June), representing a 13% decline from $1.34 billion in 2013. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency -- together with $9.5 million in returns and markdowns recorded as a result of the company's 2014 Performance Improvement Plan and Pricing Changes -- also dragged down revenue results. The company, however, reported a $145.7 million loss in 2014, attributable to a 13% drop in sales. In 2014, Elizabeth Arden posted $38 million in net cash used in operating activities, down more than $100 million from 2013's cash flow of $62 million.

   Having become a centenarian in 2009, older and wiser Elizabeth Arden has shifted its focus to serving the younger and determined-to-stay-young consumer on a global basis. To this end, the beauty company regularly introduces new products in each of the skin care, fragrance, and color categories that strengthen its association with leading celebrity and designer names, as well as anti-aging lifestyle trends.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's also working to penetrate international markets, particularly in the large European fragrance sector, with its prestige fragrance portfolio. Additionally, it aims to grow in markets such as Brazil and the Middle East.

Elizabeth Arden already holds an exclusive global fragrance agreement with country pop singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. Elizabeth Arden also purchased the licenses and related assets for the Ed Hardy, True Religion, and BCBGMAXAZRIA fragrance brands from New Wave Fragrances (for $60 million), and has launched a stream of other celeb and designer fragrances, including scents sold under the Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, Kate Spade, and John Varvatos brands.
