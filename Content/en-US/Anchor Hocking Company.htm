   While the company makes most of its revenue through its retail efforts, Anchor Hocking distributes glass products for the foodservice industry through licensing agreements. It has extended its reach into foodservice glassware through its partnership with Germany's Stölzle, a manufacturer of crystalline stemware and barware for hotels and restaurants. As part of the agreement, Anchor Hocking markets the Stölzle line of foodservice glassware in North America from its Ohio location. It also provides World Kitchen, maker of the Corelle and Chicago Cutlery product lines, with distribution services in the US, Canada, and Mexico through an agreement that became effective in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   Anchor Hocking is banking on extending its portfolio of products. Thanks to Monomoy's purchase of flatware and dinnerware supplier
   <company id="11119">
    Oneida
   </company>
   , the glassware giant aims to gain market share in the tabletop niche alongside its sister company as the two leaders work together to reposition their lines for other parts of consumers' homes.

   , which had filed for bankruptcy protection in 2006. Global Home bought Anchor Hocking from

   in 2004 for $310 million.
