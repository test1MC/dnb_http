   Named for the legendary Shawnee chief, Tecumseh Products makes a line of hermetically sealed compressors and heat pumps for residential and commercial refrigerators and freezers, water coolers, air conditioners, dehumidifiers, and vending machines. The company's line of scroll compressor models are suited for demanding commercial refrigeration applications and consist primarily of reciprocating and rotary designs. Tecumseh sells its products to OEMs and aftermarket distributors in more than 100 countries worldwide, with more than 80% of its sales generated outside of the US. In mid-2015, Tecumseh agreed to be acquired by affiliates of
   <company id="11839">
    Mueller Industries
   </company>
   and
   <company id="156880">
    Atlas Holdings
   </company>
   for $123 million.

  <p>
   Tecumseh's products are manufactured in about a dozen plants in the US, Brazil, France (five facilities), and India (two facilities); assembly plants are located in Canada, Malaysia, and Mexico. Some of the company's facilities are made possible through joint ventures; one such venture is Song Jiang in China.

   The company serves 1,600 customers including
   <company id="11632">
    Whirlpool
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41778">
    Electrolux
   </company>
   , which together generate about 12% of the company's business. In 2014 almost 45% of the sales from its Brazilian location were made to its three largest customers. The company sells its products in 97 countries primarily through its own sales staff as well as independent sales representatives and authorized wholesale distributors. It markets its products under brand names that include Celseon, Tecumseh, Wintsys, Masterflux, Silensys, and Vector.

  <p>
   Tecumseh has suffered four straight years of declining revenues and two straight years of net losses. Revenues fell 12% from $824 million in 2013 to $724 million in 2014 as the company posted a net loss of $33 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The decrease in revenue for 2014 was primarily due to a 8% drop in sales of compressors used in commercial refrigeration and aftermarket applications, a 23% decrease in sales of compressors for air conditioning applications, and a 13% drop in sales for compressors used in household refrigeration and freezer applications. Tecumseh was also negatively affected by a competitive pricing environment in Brazil and soft market conditions in North America throughout 2014.

  <p>
   Focused on growing internationally, Tecumseh has invested in research and development engineering laboratories in North America, Europe, South America, and India. It also partners with R&amp;D facilities at universities throughout the globe to provide life science research on how its products interface with the environment.

  <p>
   Master toolmakers Ray Herrick (friend and advisor to Henry Ford and Thomas Edison) and Bill Sage founded the Michigan-based company in 1930 as Hillsdale Machine &amp; Tool. Its first products included small tools, toys, and car and refrigerator parts. By 1933 Herrick controlled the company. The next year the company bought a facility in Tecumseh, Michigan, where it began mass-producing car and refrigerator parts. The company changed its name to Tecumseh Products in 1934 and went public in 1937.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the end of the 1930s, Tecumseh was a major producer of hermetic compressors. In 1941 its focus shifted to WWII efforts, and it began making anti-aircraft projectile casings and aircraft engine parts. Herrick's son Kenneth began working for Tecumseh in 1945. Two years later, a company-made compressor was used in the first home window air-conditioning unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tecumseh bought two Ohio companies in 1950 and 1952, and introduced an AC compressor for cars in 1953. Two years later the company bought compressor designer Tresco, and hired Joseph Layton as Tecumseh's president and CEO. Tecumseh gained entry into the gasoline engine market with the purchase of Wisconsin's Lauson Engine (1956) and Power Products (1957). Acquisitions in the 1960s allowed Tecumseh to tap into the power-train market.
