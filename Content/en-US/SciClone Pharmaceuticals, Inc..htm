   SciClone hopes its drug sales create a whirlwind in China. The drug firm's flagship product Zadaxin is approved for use in some 30 countries, including China, its primary market. Zadaxin treats hepatitis B, as a vaccine adjuvant (to boost a vaccine's effectiveness), as well as certain cancers. The company also partners with other drug makers, including
   <company id="10188">
    Baxter International
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   , to market those companies' products in China. SciClone also maintains a pipeline of products that it is shepherding through the approval process in China. The company entered a strategic review process in early 2016, but in July announced that it was no longer continuing active discussions with potential acquirers.

  <p>
   SciClone relies upon third parties in Europe and the US to manufacture Zadaxin. However, the drug has yet to receive the regulatory green light in the world's two largest drug markets -- the US and the European Union (EU). SciClone is working with development partner Sigma-Tau to gain marketing approval in the US and EU. In the meantime, the company figures that China will be the second largest market in the world soon enough, so it is focusing more of its efforts on development there. Its pipeline includes CDBead, Neucardin, Loramyc, and ProFlow along with cardiovascular drug Aggrastat.

  <p>
   Zadaxin is sold in 30 countries across Asia/Pacific, Latin American countries, Eastern Europe, and the Middle Ease. China accounts for about 97% of sales.

   SciClone's own sales force markets the drug to doctors and hospitals in China; distributors handle sales and marketing of the drug in other countries. In 2013

    SinoPharm

   and
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi
   </company>
   accounted for 75% and 20% of revenue, respectively.

  <p>
   In 2013 SciClone reported a 19% drop in revenue, from $156 million to $127 million, as demand dropped for Zadaxin and other products. About $5.5 million of the drop was due to the non-renewal of the company's agreements with Sanofi. Net income, however, recovered slightly after being down in 2012. In 2013 it was $11 million, up $1 million, a 14% increase as the company laid off about 300 sales people to cut expenses. Cash from operations also fell, by $34 million, to $9.5 million, due to the absence of cash from intangible assets.

   SciClone makes no secret of its plans to expand in China, particularly in the largest cities. It does this by launching new products from its pipeline and through acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   SciClone's purchase of China-based NovaMed Pharmaceuticals added a handful of products in development, including cancer, neurology and pain medicines, and broadened SciClone's existing sales force in the country. While SciClone's Zadaxin commands higher prices due to its reputation and branding, lower-priced generics from local manufacturers are a constant threat to its market share.

   As a research and development company, SciClone has already gone through a couple of candidates that turned out to be duds. While such disappointments are expensive, they are the nature of drug discovery and development.
