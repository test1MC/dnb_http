   ' Roanoke Bar Division turns crumpled Cadillacs, wrecked Renaults, and bashed Buicks into merchant steel bar, billets, and steel joists. The company operates an electric arc furnace minimill in Virginia that serves customers located mostly east of the Mississippi River. It melts scrap metal that it tunes into billets and further into rolled steel products such as trusses, girders, steel joists and steel decking primarily for the non-residential building components market. The Roanoke Division produces a substantial amount of the steel products that allowed its parent to manufacture 367,000 tons of steel fabrication products in 2013.

   The Steel Dynamics Roanoke Bar Division operates a state-of-the-art steel mini-mill in Roanoke, Virginia, which melts recycled scrap steel in electric furnaces and casts the molten steel into billets. The billets are then rolled into merchant steel products including angles, plain rounds, flats, and channels.
  </p>
  <p>
   Roanoke Bar Division sells primarily merchant steel products, including angles, plain rounds, flats and channels, and billets. It has an annual capacity of 650,000 tons of merchant bar and billet production.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2013 the Roanoke Bar Division produced 601,000 tons of billets, and 479,000 tons of finished steel products. Roanoke exported 1% of its products that year.

  <p>
   Excess steel-billet production is sold to mills without melting facilities. The company sells merchant steel products to steel service centers, fabricators, and OEMs.

   Financial Performance
  </p>
  <p>
   There are no separate financials for the company. However, its parent company said that its steel segment's revenues increased by 1% in 2013, due to higher selling volumes of sheet products and long products.

  <p>
   The Roanoke Bar Division (founded in 1955) became a part of
   <company id="52436">
    Steel Dynamics
   </company>
   when that company bought Roanoke Electric Steel in 2006 and changed its name.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   John "Jack" Hancock Jr. sold securities for 15 years before joining the Army Air Corps during WWII. He took advantage of the postwar building boom by starting a business selling Quonset huts and other products. He branched into joist fabrication but became frustrated by steel shortages during the Korean War. In response he formed Roanoke Electric Steel as a public company in 1955 and built the Southeast's first electric minimill.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the early 1970s Roanoke Electric Steel bought Shredded Products; it obtained a second rolling mill, in Salem, Virginia, in 1975. In 1985 Donald Smith became president, and the firm acquired Socar. The next year the company formed RESCO. It retrenched in 1990 as demand dwindled with the US economy. The firm consolidated its two rebar facilities into one and then shuttered its Salem mill.
  </p>
  <p>
   Demand slowly returned, and by 1994 the company's Roanoke mill had resumed operating at full capacity. Hancock died that year. A softening steel market and increased competition caused sales to drop in 1996. Roanoke Electric Steel rebounded the next year, and in 1998 it bought Steel of West Virginia, a minimill and steel fabricator that makes custom steel for heavy equipment, manufactured housing, truck trailers, and guard rails. Workers at that plant went on a two-week strike in 1999 over seniority-related issues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hurt by foreign competition, the company laid off workers in 2000. Roanoke Electric Steel faced overseas competition, a recessionary economy, crumbling construction activity, and weakening niche markets, all of which combined to lower the company's profits in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 sales fell from the previous year by 14%, and the company suffered its first loss since 1956. Despite its hardships, the company paid its 176th consecutive quarterly cash dividend (44 years of consecutive payments) to its shareholders that year. The following year, Roanoke Electric Steel's bottom line returned to the black as demand, prices, and sales improved.
