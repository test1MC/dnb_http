   LSI Industries makes lighting, graphics, and menu boards for various commercial markets, primarily in the US and Canada. LSI operates via several business segments. Its lighting unit makes LED light fixtures for outdoor/indoor/landscape use, such as convenience and chain store lighting. A graphics arm produces indoor/outdoor graphics lighting and menu boards, including digital signage, canopy graphics, and shelf talkers. Design and production of LED video screens is led by its technology and electronic components units. The company sells to a diverse group of customers, like

   LSI Industries looks to differentiate itself from the LED lighting pack by serving as a one-stop shop for lighting, graphics, and related professional services. LSI's product introductions target retail space customers that include

   dealerships. The company's lineup of LED video screens and theme lighting are marketed to sports stadiums on college and high school campuses, as well as public entertainment centers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates through three segments. The Lighting segment generates the majority of its revenue (around 70% of total sales), while Graphics contributes nearly 24%. Technology generates 6% of sales.

  <p>
   The company's lighting products are sold throughout the US, but also in Canada, Australia, and Latin America through regional sales managers and independent sales representatives and national accounts. Graphics products are sold primarily through a sales force. In addition, sales are made from local architects, engineers, petroleum, and electrical distributors and contractors.

  <p>
   LSI's revenues peaked at $322 million in 2016, its highest total in about 10 years. The growth was fueled by a 19% spike in Graphics sales and a 3% bump in Lighting sales. This offset a 21% decline from the company's Technology segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout 2016, the Graphics segment generated additional net sales of graphic identification products that contain solid-state LED light sources and LED lighting for signage. This growth occurred within the petroleum/convenience store, national drug store, quick-service restaurant, and banking markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits soared by 84% from $5 million in 2015 to $9 million in 2016 mainly due to the peak in revenue coupled with a gain on the sale of a facility. In addition, the company's cash flow from operations has fluctuated over the years; after rising the previous two years, cash flow dropped in 2016 mainly due to a net increase in inventories and a slight rise in accrued expenses.

  <p>
   LSI grows its business by focusing on product development and new product launches while keeping its spending on research and development as low as possible. Its Graphics segment has had recent success selling new graphic identification products that contain solid-state LED light sources and LED lighting for signage to the convenient store and quick-service restaurant markets.
