   Financial information is king and Thomson Reuters Corporation holds the crown. The company is the market leader in financial data (ahead of rival information provider
   <company id="40671">
    Bloomberg
   </company>
   ). Thomson Reuters provides electronic information and services to businesses and professionals worldwide, serving the financial services, media, legal, tax and accounting, and science markets. Data is primarily offered online, and to a lesser extent via CD-ROM and print formats; nearly all revenues come from subscription sales to its plethora of offerings. Thomson Reuters was created in 2008 as the result of the $16 billion cash and stock purchase of news service
   <company id="41832">
    Reuters
   </company>
   by information provider The Thomson Corporation.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Thomson Reuters has a truly global scale indeed. The company operates in more than 100 countries, and more than 40% of revenues come from outside the Americas. The business has US offices in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, and Texas, and international offices in London and Bangalore, India.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company is organized into four business units. Its Financial &amp; Risk segment accounted for more than 50% of total net sales in fiscal 2014. The segment provides news, information, and analytics to financial institutions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Legal segment provides online and print information, decision tools, software, and services that support legal, investigation, business, and government professionals. The Legal unit accounted for more than 25% of total net sales in fiscal 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thomson Reuters' Tax &amp; Accounting segment offers integrated tax compliance and accounting information, software, and services to accounting firms, corporations, law firms, and governments. The unit accounted for 11% of total net sales in fiscal 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Intellectual Property &amp; Science segment provides comprehensive intellectual property and scientific information, decision support tools, and services to governments, academia, publishers, corporations, and law firms. The Intellectual Property &amp; Science unit accounted for 8% of total net sales in fiscal 2014.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Thomson Reuters sells its products and services directly to its customers. In addition, it has been successful in selling some of its products and services online directly to customers. Focusing some of the marketing and sales efforts online has allowed it to broaden the range of customers and reduce sales and marketing costs.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In fiscal 2014 Thomson Reuters' revenue was $12.6 billion. That was a decrease of $95 million compared to fiscal 2013. The primary reason for the drop was decreased sales from the company's Financial &amp; Risk unit partially offset by increased sales from the Tax &amp; Accounting segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income was $1.9 billion in fiscal 2014. That was a dramatic increase compared to the previous fiscal period. The primary reason was due to decreased operating expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thomson Reuters ended fiscal 2014 with $2.3 billion in cash on hand from operations. That was an increase of $263 million compared to the prior fiscal year.

  <p>
   The Thomson Corporation was established when Roy Thomson started a radio station in Ontario in 1930. He next began purchasing town newspapers, venturing outside Ontario in 1949 and into the US in 1952.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Thomson newspaper empire grew rapidly, and the company next entered into a North Sea oil drilling venture. Oil accounted for the bulk of Thomson's profits by 1976, when Thomson died, and the company used its oil earnings to expand and diversify its publishing interests.
  </p>
  <p>
   Purchases included American Banker and Bond Buyer (financial publications, 1983), Gale Research (library reference materials, 1985), and several online information providers. Thomson then completed the sale of its oil and gas holdings. In 1991 it bought Maxwell's Macmillan Professional and Business Reference Publishing.  It bought law and textbook publisher West Publishing in 1996. Continuing its selective divestment of newspapers, the company sold 43 daily papers in the US and Canada in 1996. In 2000 Thomson announced it would sell its newspapers to focus on the Internet.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other Thomson purchases included a pair of tax and law publishing units from UK's
   <company id="41338">
    Pearson
   </company>
   ;
   <company id="10859">
    Knight-Ridder's
   </company>
   Technimetrics financial information unit;
   <company id="15277">
    Sylvan Learning Systems'
   </company>
   Prometric division, which provided computer-based testing services; and
   <company id="42105">
    Wave Technologies International
   </company>
   , a provider of multimedia instructional products. Thomson also bought the online data services division of
   <company id="109150">
    Dialog
   </company>
   , and it acquired rival financial data provider
   <company id="11206">
    Primark
   </company>
   for $1 billion. In 2001 the company bought the higher education and corporate training businesses of Harcourt General (which later became
   <company id="138807">
    Harcourt Education
   </company>
   ) from Reed Elsevier Group (since renamed
   <company id="41830">
    RELX Group
   </company>
   ), and acquired business content provider NewsEdge.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thomson started trading on the New York Stock Exchange in mid-2002. Later that year it beefed up its Internet education group with the purchase of certain e-learning assets from McGraw-Hill (later renamed
   <company id="10976">
    S&amp;P Global
   </company>
   ). In 2003 the company purchased Elite Information Group, a maker of law firm practice software, for more than $100 million. (The software firm later dropped the "Information Group" portion of its name to become simply
   <company id="15729">
    Elite
   </company>
   .)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Thomson purchased
   <company id="43036">
    Solucient LLC
   </company>
   , a provider of data and advanced analytics to hospitals and health systems; Quantitative Analytics, Inc., a provider of financial database integration and analysis solutions; and LiveNote Technologies, a provider of transcript and evidence management software to litigators and court reporters. Kenneth Thomson died at the age of 82 that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year Thomson exited the educational information market when it sold Thomson Learning (now called
   <company id="113006">
    Cengage Learning
   </company>
   ) to investment groups Apax Partners and OMERS Capital for $7.7 billion. Thomson cited a lack of growth potential as its primary rationale for selling Thomson Learning. The move was the latest in a long line of divestutures for Thomson -- the company had spent years selling nearly all of its traditional media assets, including most of its 130 newspapers and its stake in Bell Globemedia in favor of electronic products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thomson used the proceeds of the 2007 Thomson Learning sale to help acquire Reuters in 2008 in a $16.2 billion deal that created Thomson Reuters, the largest player in the field of financial data. Thomson Reuters was initially owned through a complex dual listing, and traded on the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq through the
   <company id="159651">
    Thomson Reuters PLC
   </company>
   entity. Tom Glocer, former CEO of Reuters, was named head of Thomson Reuters that year. His first order in the consolidation was to cut some 1,500 jobs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In its first major strategic move after its formation, Thomson Reuters sold its
   <company id="109150">
    Dialog
   </company>
   subsidiary to information provider
   <company id="121793">
    ProQuest Information and Learning
   </company>
   in 2008. Dialog offered a broad source of aggregated information; the divestiture reflected Thomson Reuters' goal of building deeper content within specialized markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of an effort to expand its content offerings, Thomson Reuters acquired some 30 companies in 2009, its first full year of business. While these purchases helped grow the company's holdings, that year Thomson Reuters saw a drop in profits from existing operations compared to 2008. The decline was mainly due to a decrease in sales from its print and non-subscription legal business, as well as from its Markets division. These businesses took a hit as the economic meltdown had a particularly harsh effect on the financial and media world.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thomson Reuters grew its Markets holdings through two key acquisitions in 2009, including Hugin Group, a provider of regulatory and news distribution services, and Breakingviews, a financial commentary website. Also in 2009 the company unified its ownership structure in order to simplify trading. The move was due to UK investors making up a shrinking portion (only 5%) of its shareholder base; as a result, the company ceased to be listed on the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. The unification did not affect Thomson Reuters' day-to-day business operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thomson Reuters added to its Professional division in 2010 with the acquisition of Complinet, which it used to help form its new Governance, Risk and Compliance business. Also in 2010 Thomson Reuters launched WestlawNext, a new version of its flagship online legal information service.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company completed the integration of Reuters, a process that began back in 2008. And after a disappointing 2011 financial performance, in 2012 the business reogranized into four core units: Thomson Financial &amp; Risk,
   <company id="41700">
    Thomson Reuters, Legal
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="112345">
    Thomson Tax &amp; Accounting
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="138124">
    Thomson Intellectual Property &amp; Science
   </company>
   . Later that year the company sold its healthcare business.
