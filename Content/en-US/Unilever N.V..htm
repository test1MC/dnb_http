   Following five years of sales growth, Unilever Group's revenue in 2014 fell by 14% to $58.9 billion, with sales declines from all product segments. Two-thirds of the drop was driven by a 7% decline food product sales, mostly from lagging spread sales in the European and North American markets. The group's refreshment product sales also fell by 4%, further hurting the top line. The company's Personal Care segment fell the least, as its Dove brand remained strong.
  </p>
  <p>
   Declining revenue caused the group's net income to drop by 6% to $6.29 billion, after two years of profit growth in 2012 and 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operations provided $6.74 billion, or 22% less cash than in 2013, partly from lower earnings, but mostly due to a combination of negative cash flows from working capital and from an elimination of profits from discontinued brand operations.

   To free up resources and focus them on growing divisions and product lines, Unilever Group has made a series of brand divestitures in recent years. In In 2013, as part of its strategy of making Foods fit for growth, the company sold off its flailing Wish-Bone, Skippy, and Unipro brands. Between 2011 and 2013, the company made a series of brand acquisitions to strategically expand its product portfolio, buying Alberto Culver, Sara Lee, Kalina, and Toni &amp; Guy.

  <p>
   In 2016 Unilever acquired start-up razor manufacturer Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion in cash. Founded in 2011, Dollar Shave Club built its business selling inexpensive men's razors exclusively through digital commerce sites. The acquisition bolsters Unilever's presence in the online sales space; the company traditionally sells its products through brick-and-mortar retailers, where profit margins can be smaller.
