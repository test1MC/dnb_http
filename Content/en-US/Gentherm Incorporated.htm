  <p>
   Gentherm has achieved unprecedented growth over the last few years primarily due to acquisitions it has made. In 2014 its revenues surged 23% to peak at a record-setting $881 million. The historic growth was fueled by overall increases in new program launches for its climate-control seat (CCS) technology coupled with additional revenue gained from an acquisition it made in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gentherm's profits have also reached historic levels, more than doubling from $34 million in 2013 to $70 million in 2014. Its operating cash flow climbed 34% from $60 million in 2013 to $80 million in 2014 due to the increased profits, increases in accounts receivable due to product revenues, and timing differences between the collection of sales in 2014.

  <p>
   The company has achieved historic revenue growth over the years primarily through the use of acquisitions. In mid-2014 it acquired Global Thermoelectric (GTE), a Calgary-based maker of industrial thermoelectric generator systems and remote power generation products. The acquisition gave the company additional expertise in thermoelectric generators and provided it with access to a number of new industrial and commercial markets. GTE operates as a subsidiary of the company and has been rebranded to Gentherm Global Power Technologies.
