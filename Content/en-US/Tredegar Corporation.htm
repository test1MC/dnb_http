   Tredegar's products can be found over, under, and in-between. The company manufactures primarily a variety of film products and aluminum extrusions. Its film lineup specializes in personal care materials, and protective and packaging films, such as liners and back sheets used in diapers, feminine-hygiene products, surgical masks, permeable ground covers, and cheesecloth. Aluminum extrusions, produced by its
   <company id="117225">
    Bonnell
   </company>
   subsidiary, are used mainly in building and construction markets. Tredegar's manufacturing facilities are located in the US, the Netherlands, Hungary, China, Brazil, and India.

   Tredegar operates through two segments: Film Products and Aluminum Extrusions. The Film Products segment (contributing 61% of net revenue) manufactures plastic films, elastics, and laminate materials primarily for personal care products and surface protection and packaging applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aluminum Extrusions (36%) is operated by
   <company id="117225">
    The William L. Bonnell Company
   </company>
   , which produces high-quality, soft-alloy and medium-strength aluminum extrusions primarily for the building and construction, automotive, consumer durables, machinery and equipment, electrical and distribution markets.

  <p>
   Tredegar's products are sold across the building and construction (nonresidential and residential), consumer durables, machinery and equipment, automotive, distribution, and electrical sectors. Its largest customer is
   <company id="11211">
    The Procter &amp; Gamble Company
   </company>
   , which contributed 23% of its net revenue in 2014. Tredegar's aluminum extrusions serve approximately 1,500 customers.

  <p>
   After logging three straight years of growth, Tredegar saw its revenues dip 2% from $961 million in 2013 to $945 million to 2014. Its profits, however, climbed 68% from $22 million to $37 million over that same time period. Its operating cash flows decreased by 33% in 2014, due to increased cash outflows in accounts and notes receivables.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue decline for 2014 was due to lower sales in Film Products due to the shutdown of a babycare elastic laminate films manufacturing facility, along with reduced sales volumes for polyethylene overwrap and surface protection films.
  </p>
  <p>
   The seismic increase in profits for 2014 was attributed to a major decline in income taxes, along with a gain from discontinued operations. Profits were also affected by a decline in selling, general, and administrative expenses, resulting from lower costs in Aluminum Extrusions.

  <p>
   Tredegar is focused on investing into productivity improvements and growth and market diversification in its Bonnell subsidiary. In 2014 it added medium-strength extrusion capability to its large press in the Carthage, Tennessee facility, expanding Bonnell's breadth of offerings to its customers. Tredegar is also focused on cost reductions and gains from new surface protection films and new personal care products.
