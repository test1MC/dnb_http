   Astex Pharmaceuticals (formerly SuperGen) fights for a better way to treat cancer. The company focuses on compounds in preclinical and early-stage clinical development. Its development pipeline includes candidates aiming to treat conditions such as lung cancer and leukemia. Astex Pharmaceuticals also has preclinical cancer research programs conducted in partnership with
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   . Successes include cancer compound Dacogen, which is licensed to
   <company id="56282">
    Eisai
   </company>
   . The company, which was acquired by
   <company id="138076">
    Otsuka Pharmaceutical
   </company>
   in 2013, has research operations to the UK and development and regulatory operations in the US.

  <p>
   Astex Pharmaceuticals receives development and license revenues from partnered programs and royalty revenues relating to sales of Dacogen (decitabine) for Injection (a product approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes), which is licensed to
   <company id="56282">
    Eisai
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Astex Pharmaceuticals also partially funds its R&amp;D operations through royalty revenues received from Eisai on sales of myelodysplastic syndromes treatment Dacogen in about 30 countries. Dacogen is also under development for use in the treatment of leukemia.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company's revenues grew by 26% in 2011 thanks to an increase in royalty, development, and license revenues. Royalty revenues grew thanks to higher worldwide Dacogen sales by Eisai. Development and license revenue growth included the recognition of up-front payments from
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   and
   <company id="100382">
    Janssen
   </company>
   in connection with research and license agreements of $2 million in 2011 as compared to $509,000 in 2010. The increase in revenues from up-front payments in 2011 came from a research alliance with Janssen that generated revenues subsequent to the then SuperGen's acquisition of
   <company id="133824">
    Astex Therapuetics
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the company's net income dropped by 66% in 2011 due to an increase in R&amp;D costs, general and administrative expenses, and higher amortization of intangibles and impairment charges primarily due to the consolidation of Astex Therapeutics' activities and corresponding expenditures related to drug discovery efforts and clinical trial costs for a handful of drugs, and one-time severance costs of $995,000.

   The company focuses on the discovery and development of novel small molecule therapeutics with an emphasis on oncology and hematology. Like all drug developers, Astex Pharmaceuticals works to keep its operations flexible. It focuses on preclinical and early-stage clinical candidates that it can later license out to third parties. To differentiate itself, the firm prefers to work with complex targets that aren't identified by the high through-put screening models used by larger companies. The company's research programs use cell signaling, cancer metabolism, and epigenetic (gene activity control) technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Astex Pharmaceuticals expanded its cancer and virology research programs through the $55 million acquisition of Astex Therapeutics in 2011, adding candidates previously being developed by Astex Therapeutics both independently and through partnerships with the likes of
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Its current pipeline includes SGI-110, a treatment for solid tumors including myelodysplastic syndrome (a bone marrow disease) and acute myeloid leukemia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Development of cancer candidate amuvatinib was discontinued in 2012, pending possible future funding should the company find interested partners. A compound that was undergoing clinical trials for small-cell lung cancer, SGI-1776, for prostate cancer and lymphoma was canceled in 2010 due to toxicity issues.
