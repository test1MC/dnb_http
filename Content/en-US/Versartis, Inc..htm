   Versartis seeks to help the short-statured. The development-stage biopharmaceutical company has a single drug in development: VRS-317, a long-acting recombinant human growth hormone (HGH) for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in children. While recombinant treatments for GHD (an orphan disease) already exist, they require daily injections, while VRS-317 does not. (The company is evaluating weekly, semi-monthly, and monthly dosing regimens.) The drug is currently being studied in children in phase 3 clinical trials. A treatment for adults is a longer-term prospect. Founded in 2008, Versartis went public in 2014.

  <p>
   In March 2014 Versartis sold 6 million shares priced at $21 each, raising $126 million. Proceeds from the offering are being used to see VRS-317 through clinical trials and development.

  <p>
   If VRS-317 gains marketing approval, Versartis plans to sell the drug in the US and Canada through its own specialized sales force.

  <p>
   The start-up has yet to generate any income from operations, as it has no marketed products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Versartis has incurred significant losses since its inception; net losses increased 349% to $83 million in 2014 on higher R&amp;D expenses and increased general and administrative costs. At the end of 2014 the firm had an accumulated deficit of $111.3 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow increased 132% to $40 million that year.

  <p>
   Versartis's goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutics for the treatment of endocrine disorders, such as GHD. Near-term, the company is looking to complete the clinical development and seek regulatory approval for VRS-317 for the treatment of GHD in children; and to commercialize VRS-317 independently in the US. Longer term, Versartis plans to explore the use of VRS-317 in adults with GHD, ISS (idiopathic short stature, which is short stature of unknown cause), and Turner Syndrome.
