   Consumers rely on Want Want China Holdings when they're looking for something tasty. Recognized for rice cracker brands Hot Kid and Want Want, the company also makes roasted nuts and seeds, ice pops, candy, jellies, and other snack foods. The firm's beverage offerings include aseptically packaged milk, milk powder, canned sodas, teas, juices, and yogurt drinks, as well as wine, sake, and distilled liquors. Mainland China accounts for most of Want Want China's sales, but the company also sells its products in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and elsewhere in Asia and beyond. In addition to food and beverages, Want Want manufactures packaging materials, including bags, films, boxes, and cans.

   Want Want sells its products through sales outlets, product roadshows, e-commerce, and maternity channels. The company's five largest customers contributed almost 30% of its total revenues in 2015.

  <p>
   From 2014 to 2015 the company's revenues decreased by 9% and profits fell by 13%. This was mainly due to fewer sales from dairy products and beverages, which was fueled by fewer Hot-Kid milk products sold due to a weak market environment and heavy discounts offered by the industry to reduce its inventory level. Snack foods sales also decreased by 10% in 2015 due to a decline in popsicles and jellies revenue.

  <p>
   Want Want focuses on expanding its promotional activities by concentrating more on feedback provided by its customers. In 2016 and beyond, the company will integrate its marketing resources and strive for breakthroughs in new differentiated product areas. Adhering to this strategy, it will be promoting its yogurt drink products, including its O Bubble fruit milk drink and children's yogurt.
