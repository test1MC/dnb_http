   A rock-solid reputation? You betcha. One of North America's containerboard giants, WestRock (formerly Rock-Tenn) produces packaging for food, hardware, apparel, and other consumer goods. With approximately 9.2 million tons of mill capacity, the company's lineup includes recycled and bleached paperboard, containerboard, consumer and corrugated packaging, and point-of-purchase displays. Specialty paperboard is also converted into book cover and laminated paperboard and sold to other manufacturers for such applications as furniture, storage, and automotive components. In mid-2015, Rock-Tenn purchased rival

   WestRock completed the acquisition of Cenveo Packaging, a leading provider of value-add folded carton and litho-laminated display packaging solutions during 2016. The deal gave the company seven facilities in North America with capabilities including MiraFoil, cold foil, and low migration ink systems.
