   Those wanting to see more clearly might benefit from a range of eye care  products made by Abbott Medical Optics (AMO). The  company makes eye care products in three key segments: corneal, refractive, and cataract. Its corneal products include contact lens solutions and eye drops for consumers. Its refractive and cataract product lines focus on professional devices, equipment, and accessories used in laser vision correction procedures and cataract surgery; AMO is the global leader in LASIK surgical devices.
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   bought AMO from
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Laboratories
   </company>
   for $4.3 billion in early 2017.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Products in AMO's cataract line include laser cataract technology, monofocal and multifocal intraocular lenses, phacoemulsification systems, viscoelastics, and related products used in ocular surgery. Refractive line products include wavefront diagnostic devices, femtosecond lasers and associated patient interface devices; excimer laser vision correction systems and treatment cards. Products in the eye care line include disinfecting solutions, enzymatic cleaners, lens rewetting drops, and artificial tears.

  <p>
   AMO's eye care and contact lens products, including the Blink and COMPLETE brands, are promoted to eye care clinics and retail merchandisers for direct sale to consumers. Its surgery products are marketed to eye surgeons and surgery centers worldwide through a direct sales force. The company has sales and manufacturing operations in some 25 countries and markets its wares worldwide. Its products are sold through independent distributors in smaller markets.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015, AMO reported sales of $1.1 billion, a 7% decline from the $1.2 billion in made in 2014. Although the company saw an increase in sales of cataract products, there was a decline in the refractive line products that year. Some 61% of that revenue came from outside of the US.

  <p>
   In a move to focus more on its cardiovascular and diagnostic operations,
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Laboratories
   </company>
   agreed to sell AMO to health care giant
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   (J&amp;J) in 2016. That $4.3 billion deal, which closed in early 2017, will help J&amp;J as it works to develop a stronger vision care business, an area it is targeting as the population ages and faces such ailments as cataracts. (It is estimated that some 20 million people globally are blind from cataracts, and that number is only expected to grow.) J&amp;J's
   <company id="103993">
    Vision Care
   </company>
   subsidiary entered the cataract surgery arena through the acquisition.
  </p>
  <p>
   AMO is working to expand its line of laser devices for vision correction procedures. It is also developing new cataract surgery devices, such as the Synchrony intraocular lens that was recently introduced in Europe and other countries and is under
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   review for marketing in the US. The Synchrony implant mimics the eye's ability to change focus and see clearly at all distances. AMO is also working on other instruments for optical scanning and treatment procedures.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, AMO introduced new products including the TECNIS-1 Monofocal IOL in a preloaded insertion system; an upgrade to its Signature phacoemulsification system for cataract removal; an upgrade to its CATALYS laser cataract system that helps surgeons to identify a cataract patient's axis of astigmatism; and iDesign, an advanced vision diagnostic and LASIK treatment planning system.

   Former parent
   <company id="10059">
    Allergan
   </company>
   spun off Advanced Medical Optics in 2002 through a public share offering.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 it beefed up its cataract product offerings through the $450 million purchase of
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   's surgical ophthalmology business the previous year, adding the Healon viscoelastic and Tecnis intraocular lens product lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired
   <company id="17105">
    VISX
   </company>
   in 2005 for $1.3 billion and continued to market the acquired company's refractive laser vision correction systems and treatment cards under the VISX brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its acquisition of laser correction rival
   <company id="133079">
    IntraLase
   </company>
   for more than $800 million in early 2007 represented a significant addition, giving it technology used in LASIK procedures and also in corneal transplant surgery.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company attempted to make a $4.3 billion acquisition of rival eye care products maker
   <company id="10187">
    Bausch &amp; Lomb
   </company>
   in mid-2007, but it later withdrew its bid, stating that Bausch &amp; Lomb seemed intent on completing its earlier $3.7 billion agreement to be acquired by
   <company id="103796">
    Warburg Pincus
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Advanced Medical Optics issued a voluntary recall of one of its lens care products -- Complete MoisturePlus lens solution -- after the
   <company id="104757">
    Centers for Disease Control
   </company>
   discovered a link between the solution and an outbreak of a serious eye infection.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advanced Medical Optics was acquired by
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Laboratories
   </company>
   in 2009; its name was then changed to Abbott Medical Optics.
