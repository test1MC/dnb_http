   STRATTEC's moving beyond its traditional lock and key products and diversifying with a more sophisticated set of power access control products, as purely mechanical devices are growing stale. The company views electro-mechanical devices for vehicles -- mechanical locks, keys, housings, and latches that are enhanced by built-in electronics -- as the future. These include devices that incorporate user bio-identification systems, keys with remote entry capabilities, and ignition interfaces with passive start capabilities, among other technologies.
