   PQ Holdings (formerly PQ Corporation) minds its Ps and Qs when producing industrial chemicals. It operates in three principal segments: Performance Chemicals, Catalysts, and Specialty Glass Materials. PQ is one of the world's largest producers of sodium silicates (a widely used glass product made from sand). Its Catalysts unit produces silica and zeolite-based catalysts serving the polyethylene, polymerization, chemical synthesis, emissions control, lube, and refining markets. The company's Specialty Glass Materials business produces engineered glass materials for the transportation safety, oil and gas, polymer additives, and metal finishing markets. The
   <company id="42166">

   -backed company filed to go public in 2014.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 IPO.flsnp" />
  <p>
   PQ is looking to raise $450 million though its IPO. Prior to the filing,
   <company id="42166">
    Carlyle
   </company>
   owned 50.6 % of the company;
   <company id="162787">
    INEOS
   </company>
   , 33.7%. (A resurgent stock market and continued low interest rates has prompted Carlyle and other private equity firms to take some of their private portfolio companies public in order to generate new capital).
  </p>
  <p>
   PQ plans to use the net proceeds from the IPO to pay down long term debt, pay related premiums, accrued, and unpaid interest and expenses, and to pay a fee to INEOS and Carlyle to terminate consulting agreements.
  </p>

  <p>
   PQ markets about 40 different silica-based chemical and performance product lines and operates more than 60 chemical and manufacturing sites worldwide. It has operations in Australia, The Netherlands, South Africa, and the US. It has R&amp;D centers in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, and Warrington in the UK. Its Pulp &amp; Paper Excellence &amp; Drilling Fluids center is in Toronto, Canada.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates through three principal businesses: Performance Chemicals, Catalysts, and Specialty Glass Materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Performance Chemicals segment produces sodium silicate, specialty silicas and other high performance chemical products for the personal care, food, detergent, pulp and paper, electronics, mining, oil processing and construction industries. Its potassium silicates are used in welding rods, soaps, and detergents. PQ's magnesium sulfate is used in animal feed, packaging, and pharmaceuticals. PQ Europe, South Africa and Indonesia focuses on silica, soluble silicate, zeolite and magnesium silicate technology and operates 15 manufacturing sites on three continents.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Catalysts Group consists of the Silica Catalysts business (advanced silica gel products for catalyst and antiblocking applictions) and  Zeolyst International (a partnership with
   <company id="50019">
    Royal Dutch Shell
   </company>
   which makes zeolite products for catalyst and adsorbent applications).
  </p>
  <p>
   The Specialty Glass Materials segment produces engineered glass materials serving the transportation safety, oil and gas, polymer additives, metal finishing, and conductive particle markets. It sells to more than 4,000 customers, across 14 major end-uses from six manufacturing facilities on six continents. Glass-bead products from its Potters Industries affiliate are used in highway striping to reflect headlights. PQ's glass beads are also used to grind and process pigments for paints, inks, and cosmetics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wholly owned Canadian subsidiary National Silicates has production and distribution facilities for sodium and potassium silicates in Valleyfield, Quebec; Toronto, Ontario; Fort Frances, Ontario; Whitecourt, Alberta; Surrey and Parksville, British Columbia. Liquid Magnesium sulphate, commonly known as Epsom salt, is produced in Surrey, Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company supports its various performance chemical product lines as well as their many applications though a technical service and quality assurance group. For both its catalyst and antiblock customers, PQ seeks to establish long-term, mutually beneficial relationships to enable rapid product development and cost-efficient problem solving.

  <p>
   The company serve more than 4,000 customers including National Silicates (PQ's wholly owned Canadian subsidiary), engineered glass materials producer (and affiliate) Potters Industries LLC, and zeolite-based catalysts and adsorbents manufacturer (and partner) Zeolyst International.

  <p>
   In 2013 PQ formed a partnership with the Kansas Department of Commerce, agreeing to invest $120 million to expand its manufacturing footprint at its Kansas City plant to meet the growing global demand for specialty catalysts. The investment expands the already extensive equipment and manufacturing capacity for PQ's silica catalyst business and its Zeolyst International specialty catalyst operation.

  <p>
   After more than a century and a half of family ownership, PQ Corporation has gone through several ownership changes in recent years. It was owned by the founding Elkinton family until 2005, when the family sold the company to an affiliate of
   <company id="99789">
    JPMorgan Partners
   </company>
   . JPMorgan then sold PQ to the
   <company id="42166">
    Carlyle Group
   </company>
   for $1.5 billion in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   Not long after Carlyle Group acquired the company, it merged PQ with former competitor
   <company id="135965">
    Ineos Silicas
   </company>
   , creating a billion-dollar behemoth that still retained the PQ name. In 2014 PQ was owned by The Carlyle Group, INEOS, and PQ Management.
  </p>
  <p>
   PQ traces its roots to a family soap and candle business opened by Joseph Elkinton in 1831 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's PQ moniker dates back to 1864 when the company was renamed as Philadelphia Quartz and was selling sodium silicate.
