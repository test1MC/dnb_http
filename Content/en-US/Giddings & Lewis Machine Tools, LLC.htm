   Giddings &amp; Lewis Machine Tools (dba MAG Giddings &amp; Lewis) hopes your business is boring. The company manufactures large capacity precision machine tools, including horizontal and vertical machining and turning centers and boring mills. Its tools feature modular functions that allow workers to adjust the machine to their job, increasing productivity. Its lineup is used worldwide by small shops and heavy equipment manufacturers in aerospace, construction, mining, oilfield, and power generation industries, as well as military services. The company also offers contract machining services. It is part of MAG Industrial Automation Systems, a portfolio of businesses held by acquisition and management firm Maxcor Inc.

  <p>
   Founded in 1859, Giddings &amp; Lewis incorporated in 1895 as Giddings &amp; Lewis Machine Tool. The company went public in 1937. United Dominion Industries bought the company in 1982. After restructuring the firm, United Dominion sold Giddings &amp; Lewis to the public in 1989. The business grew through acquisitions and by focusing on custom-designed, high-value machines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales fell in 1993, hurt by a drop in aerospace and defense orders. The next year Giddings &amp; Lewis introduced VARIAX, a faster, more accurate machine tool than others available at the time. In 1995 the company bought Fadal Engineering, the #1 US producer of small vertical machining centers. The 1995 restructuring of its German subsidiary resulted in a big write-off and depressed profits for the year. The next year Giddings &amp; Lewis posted a loss that was related, in part, to its expense of more than $64 million to fix tools at GM and Chrysler plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   Harnischfeger Industries made a hostile takeover bid for the company in 1997. The chairman and CEO at the time, Marvin Isles, turned to German industrial giant Thyssen for assistance. Thyssen bought Giddings &amp; Lewis for $675 million. The next year Thyssen (now
   <company id="59131">
    ThyssenKrupp
   </company>
   ) initiated a $100 million project with the company to develop a new family of tool systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seeking to expand its presence in China, in 1998 the company formed Shanghai Fadal Machine Tool Company, a joint venture with the Industry Management Investment Company (China). Giddings &amp; Lewis also combined its Sheffield Measurement and its controls business units to increase efficiency and technical alignment. In 1999 the company bought a controlling interest in India-based Kirloskar Warner Swasey (horizontal lathes and vertical machining centers). When the US manufacturing economy slowed down in late 2000 and early 2001, the company partly offset the sales decline with better sales in Latin America and Europe. In late 2001 Giddings &amp; Lewis started a restructuring plan to offset a slump in US sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 the company closed a Wisconsin foundry that had been in operation for more than a century. Foundry employees had been on strike for about a month, and customers had looked to other companies to fill orders.
  </p>
  <p>
   Maxcor, a private equity buyout firm, and Silver Point Finance acquired Giddings &amp; Lewis from ThyssenKrupp in 2005, along with several other firms from the German conglomerate's MetalCutting group. ThyssenKrupp's move to restructure resulted in its selling off Giddings &amp; Lewis (G&amp;L), along with Cross Huller, Huller Hille and Hessapp, and Witzig &amp; Frank. Maxcor picked up the lot and married them, along with Cincinnati Lamb (now
   <company id="105511">
    Cincinnati Automation &amp; Test
   </company>
   ), under MAG Industrial Automation Systems (MAG). G&amp;L subsequently merged with Cincinnati Automation &amp; Test and Cincinnati Machine to create Cincinnati Technologies, which became a core operating segment of MAG.
