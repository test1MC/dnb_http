  <p>
   The company reported a 5% jump in overall revenues led by stronger performances by its High Performance Fibres, Pharmaceuticals and Home Health Care, Trading and Retail segments, where revenue increased by 15%, 5%, and 3%, respectively. This offset weaker performances by its Polyester Fibres and Films and Plastics segments, which decreased by 1% and 1.4%, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   Teijin's net income decrease of 52% in 2012 was due to the decline in operating income caused by supply chain disruptions as a result of the natural disasters in Japan and Thailand, as well as to lackluster conditions in electronics markets worldwide, which caused a deterioration of results in the Films and Plastics segment. Other factors included a 7% increase in cost of sales due to as a consequence of costs incurred by subsidiaries that changed their accounting period and of rising prices for fuel and raw materials, and a 7% increase in selling, general and administrative  expenses due to standardization of accounting periods, as well as an increase in labor costs. R&amp;D expenses were up 1% due to forward-looking investments in corporate research in key technological areas and in the cultivation of new businesses.
