   Steel processor Friedman Industries operates in two business segments: coil products and tubular products. The company's Texas Tubular Products unit, the larger of Friedman Industries' segments, buys pipe and coil material and processes it for use in pipelines, oil and gas drilling, and piling and structural applications. Friedman Industries' coil products unit purchases hot-rolled steel coils and processes them into sheet and plate products. The company's XSCP unit sells surplus prime, secondary, and transition steel coils. Friedman Industries' processing facilities are located near mills operated by

   and

   (USS)'s Tubular Products subsidiary is both a supplier to and a customer of Friedman Industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sells coil products and processing services to 150 customers primarily in the midwestern, southwestern, and southeastern areas of the US. Its principal customers include steel distributors and customers fabricating steel products such as storage tanks, steel buildings, farm machinery and equipment, construction equipment, transportation equipment, conveyors and other similar products. It sells most of its coil products through its own sales force.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tubular products are sold across the US to 170 customers (steel and pipe distributors, piling contractors and USS. Sales of pipe to USS accounted for 14% of  company's total sales in 2013, and 24% in 2012. Tubular products are sold through Friedman Industries' own sales team.

  <p>
   The company's revenues declined by 16% in 2013. Tubular sales dropped by 25% as the result of lower volumes sold (111,500 tons in 2012 compared to 92,000 tons in 2013) and lower prices ($828 per ton in 2012 compared to $754 per ton in 2013).
  </p>
  <p>
   Coil sales decreased by 3% due to lower prices (from $807 per ton in 2012 compared to $727 in 2013), partially offset by higher coil tons sold.
  </p>
  <p>
   Friedman Industries' net income decreased by 25% in 2013 due to a decrease in revenues.

  <p>
   The company's financial health is heavily affected by steel commodity and product pricing in the market as well as its dependency on one of two major suppliers.

  <p>
   In 1939 Mendel Friedman founded a steel business in El Dorado, Arkansas. His sons Jack and Harold joined him, and in 1965 the family consolidated its businesses to form Friedman Industries. The company had a steel service center in Houston and a steel service center and a structural pipe manufacturing plant in Fort Worth, Texas.
  </p>
  <p>
   Faced with strong competition, the firm diversified in 1969 by building a steel coil-processing plant near the Lone Star Steel plant in Lone Star, Texas. In 1970 Friedman closed its Fort Worth facilities and sold its pipe manufacturing equipment. The company went public in 1972 and used the proceeds to expand the Lone Star plant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Friedman performed well in the mid-1980s and returned to the pipe business. In the early 1990s steel producer Nucor asked the company to set up shop near its Hickman, Arkansas, minimill. Friedman agreed and construction was completed in early 1994.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rising oil prices in 2000 led to sales increases in Friedman's tubular products, but softness in steel coil sales more than offset the gains and the company saw its profits decline about 7%. Again in 2001 Friedman prospered in its tubular sector with the increase in domestic oil drilling; however, the coil-processing sector took a hit with the influx of cheap imported steel.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2002 the company announced that it would boost its higher-producing operations by closing its marginally productive coil-processing unit in Houston. In 2004 Friedman Industries opened a second pipe mill at its Lone Star facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   In past years, it has generally purchased enough pipe from USS to account for about 30% of Friedman Industries' overall sales. In 2009, when its orders dried up, USS idled its Texas plant adjacent to the Friedman facility, significantly affecting sales. In response, Friedman cut its workforce and lowered its output. A weak economy also affected Friedman Industries' other operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   By early 2010 the USS plant was operating again, but only at about half-capacity. By then, the financial damage was done: Friedman Industries' revenues for 2010 dropped almost 70% to $65 million from $208 million the previous year; net income dropped even further (some 95%) to about $650,000, down from almost $14 million in 2009.
