   One of the largest containerboard manufacturers in the US, Packaging Corporation of America (PCA) produces about 3.7 million tons of containerboard a year, most of which is converted into corrugated boxes, and ships about 48.9 billion square feet of corrugated products. PCA's mills also churn out about 1.1 million tons of kraft linerboard and about a million tons of semi-chemical corrugating medium. The company sells to a diverse group of industries. Its corrugated packaging includes shipping containers for manufactured goods, retail boxes and displays, and wax-coated boxes and meat boxes for agricultural use.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates in three segments: packaging, paper, and corporate and other. Packaging, which accounts for 78% of sales, produces a variety of corrugated packaging products. The paper segment, 20% of sales, makes and sells a range of papers, including communication papers, and pressure sensitive papers (collectively, white papers), and market pulp. PCA's Paper segment operates under the trade name Boise Paper. Corporate and other includes support staff services and related assets and liabilities, transportation assets, and activity related to other ancillary support operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nationwide, the corrugated products industry consists of 525 companies and 1,200 plants. Plants generally serve a market radius of around 150 miles. At PCA, more than 80% of the containerboard produced at its plants are used by its corrugated products locations. Remaining output is used by external customers. Along with containerboard, corrugated containers, retail packaging, storage supplies, and heavy-duty packaging products, the company provides services including graphics, design, technical support, value improvement, branding, and e-commerce support.

  <p>
   PCA operates eight containerboard mills (five containerboard mills and three paper mills) and about 100 corrugated products plants in more than 30 US states. The company's substantial manufacturing footprint is enhanced by a technical and development hub, half a dozen regional graphic design centers, and several printing and distribution sites. PCA also leases cutting rights on 83,000 acres of timberland and has supply agreements on an additional 281,000 acres -- most neighboring its Counce, Tennessee, and Valdosta, Georgia, mills. The company operates also has some converting operations in Europe, Mexico, and Canada.

  <p>
   PCA promotes its products through a direct sales and marketing force as well as independent brokers and distribution partners. It employs a sales manager and sales representatives at most of its corrugated product manufacturing locations. The company serves 17,000 customers in more than 33,000 locations. About three-quarters of sales of corrugated products go to local and regional accounts (located near a single PCA plant); remaining sales come from national accounts (customers who have widespread locations and are served by several PCA plants). Products are distributed by rail or truck. Rail shipments  account for 65% of the tons shipped; truck shipments, 35%. PCA's largest paper segment customer has been

  <p>
   After posting a record-setting $5.8 billion in revenues for 2014, PCA saw sales decline by 2% to $5.7 billion in 2015. PCA's profits, however, increased 11% from $393 million in 2014 to $437 million in 2015 mainly due to a decrease in expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The marginal revenue drop for 2015 was due to a decrease in sales from its packaging segment in addition to its exit from its newsprint business and the sale of its Hexacomb operations in Mexico and Europe.

  <p>
   The company has been trimming its operations in order to increase its profits. In 2015 it sold its Hexacomb corrugated manufacturing operations in Mexico and Europe for $23 million. The year before, PCA exited it newsprint business.
