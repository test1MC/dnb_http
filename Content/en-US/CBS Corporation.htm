   CBS Corporation operates through five segments. Its Entertainment segment consists of the CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios, CBS Global Distribution Group, CBS Films, and CBS Interactive. The Cable Networks segment consists of Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Publishing segment consists of Simon &amp; Schuster's consumer book publishing business with imprints such as Simon &amp; Schuster, Pocket Books, Scribner and Free Press. The Local Broadcasting segment consists of CBS Television Stations and CBS Radio, with revenues generated primarily from advertising sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2015 the Entertainment segment contributed more than half (60%) of the company's total revenue. The company's Cable Networks segment accounted for 16% in fiscal 2015.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   CBS Corporation has operations in the US, Canada, and Europe (including the UK). In fiscal 2015 the US contributed about 86% of the company's total revenue.
  </p>

  <p>
   CBS continues to draw the largest number of TV viewers among broadcast networks with hit crime shows and comedies. The high ratings allow CBS to charge advertisers more and more every year. Advertising accounted for almost 50% of the company's total revenues during fiscal 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   CBS Corporation itself incurred total advertising expenses of about $369 million in fiscal 2015. The company has a presence online with such leading websites as CNET (technology news and reviews), GameSpot (video game information), and Last.fm (social networking for music fans). Its CBS Interactive segment focuses on selling advertising across its vast collection of properties.

  <p>
   The company's revenue has fluctuated during the past five fiscal years. In fiscal 2015, its revenue was $13.89 billion, which was an increase of 1% compared to fiscal 2014. The small spike was due to an increase in revenue from the company's Entertainment and Cable Networks segments. Revenue from Local Broadcasting and Corporate/Eliminations decreased during fiscal 2015 compared to the previous fiscal period.
  </p>
  <p>
   CBS claimed $1.41 billion in net income for fiscal 2015. That was a drop of 52% compared to the company's net income in fiscal 2014.  The sharp decrease in net income was due to a decrease in earnings from discontinued operations along with impairment charges.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the drop in net income during fiscal 2015, CBS ended the year with $1.39 billion in cash on hand from operations. That was an increase of 9% compared to its cash on hand at the end of fiscal 2014.

   Like rival media companies including
   <company id="11603">
    Walt Disney
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41816">
    News Corporation
   </company>
   , CBS Corporation focuses on the integration of its content production and distribution businesses in order to generate multiple streams of revenue. A television show created by CBS Television Studios, for example, can be broadcast by the CBS network and later syndicated to local stations and cable outlets. Programming can also be released to consumers on DVD by CBS Home Entertainment and turned into licensed apparel and other retail goods by its CBS Consumer Products division. CBS Corporation also uses its multiple outlets, on TV, radio, and online, to cross-promote its vast array of media properties.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, CBS launched its digital streaming subscription offering of Showtime that is available both on a stand-alone basis and through third-party digital platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's publishing business is looking to digital media in order to turn itself around. Like other publishers, Simon &amp; Schuster is struggling to manage the long, slow decline in consumer book purchasing by focusing on cutting operating and production costs. Part of that effort has meant investing in new technologies to sell books to users of electronic readers, such as
   <company id="51493">
    Amazon
   </company>
   's Kindle and the iPad from
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   . It also sells manuscripts through social publishing site
   <company id="161243">
    Scribd
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   CBS has been working to expand its global channel presence through domestic and international joint ventures. The company is licensing its entire Showtime portfolio in the international marketplace through deals with Bell Media in Canada, and Sky in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Austria, and Italy. CBS expanded into Australia through a deal with Stan, a joint venture between Nine Entertainment and Fairfax Media.

   The company that would eventually become CBS Corporation began as Viacom in 1970. It was the result of numerous mergers and acquisitions dating back nearly 90 years, combining everything from a movie studio to a company that made car bumpers. CBS launched Viacom after the FCC ruled that TV networks could not own cable systems and TV stations in the same market. Viacom took over CBS's program syndication division and bought TV and radio stations in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1978 it co-founded pay-TV network Showtime. Viacom became full owner in 1982 and combined Showtime with The Movie Channel the following year to form
   <company id="104060">
    Showtime Networks
   </company>
   . Viacom also began producing TV series and bought
   <company id="101156">
    MTV Networks
   </company>
   in 1986.
  </p>
  <p>
   After a bidding war with renowned financier Carl Icahn and a Viacom management group, Sumner Redstone's
   <company id="42260">
    National Amusements
   </company>
   bought 83% of Viacom in 1987. Viacom bought King's Entertainment (theme parks) shortly thereafter and followed that with two mega-deals in 1994: it bought
   <company id="54403">
    Paramount Communications
   </company>
   for about $10 billion (which included
   <company id="43566">
    Simon &amp; Schuster
   </company>
   ) and
   <company id="10218">
    Blockbuster
   </company>
   for $8.4 billion (which included Spelling Entertainment). The next year, along with
   <company id="10332">
    Chris-Craft
   </company>
   , Viacom launched UPN (
   <company id="101166">
    United Paramount Network
   </company>
   ), the fifth commercial-broadcast TV network in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chiseling away at a mountain of debt, Viacom dumped its radio stations and sold its share in USA Networks (now named
   <company id="52963">
    IAC/InterActiveCorp
   </company>
   ) to
   <company id="43679">
    Universal
   </company>
   for $1.7 billion in 1997. In 1998 it sold the reference and education publishing divisions of Simon &amp; Schuster to Pearson for $4.6 billion and unloaded the unprofitable Blockbuster Music chain to
   <company id="41707">
    Wherehouse Entertainment
   </company>
   for $115 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Viacom created an Internet division (MTV Networks Online) in 1999 to house its MTV, VH1, and Nickelodeon Web sites (later decentralized into
   <company id="99990">
    The MTVi Group
   </company>
   and Nickelodeon Online). Later that year it sold 18% of Blockbuster in an IPO and sold 10% of MTVi to TCI Music (later
   <company id="12312">
    Liberty Digital
   </company>
   ) in exchange for the SonicNet websites.
  </p>
  <p>
   Viacom bought Chris-Craft's 50%-stake in the struggling UPN Network for a paltry $5 million in 2000 by exercising a buy-sell clause in the contract. BHC Communications (Chris-Craft's 80%-owned subsidiary that actually owned the stake in UPN) filed suit to block Viacom's merger with CBS, claiming that it violated a non-compete clause in the contract, but the New York Supreme Court ruled in Viacom's favor. Its $45 billion merger with CBS went through (reuniting two companies split apart by the government 30 years ago), and Viacom was given one year to sell UPN. However, a federal law prohibiting ownership of more than one TV network was overturned in 2001 allowing Viacom to keep the network.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later that year Viacom's victory over Chris-Craft turned to sour grapes when
   <company id="41816">
    News Corp.
   </company>
   agreed to buy Chris-Craft. The deal could have forced UPN to fold if News Corp. had turned Chris-Craft's large-market UPN stations into
   <company id="103359">
    FOX
   </company>
   affiliates (a new pact later signed with Chris-Craft keeps UPN as the stations' network).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001, Viacom bought the rest of Infinity Broadcasting that it didn't already own, as well as
   <company id="109897">
    Black Entertainment Television
   </company>
   (the media company targeting African-Americans) for $3 billion. It also folded MTVi back into parent MTV Networks. Other cost cutting measures in 2002 included combining the business operations of UPN and CBS and placing Simon &amp; Schuster under the same division as its film and TV production holdings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Two years later, Viacom finally sold its majority stake in Blockbuster, which never really fit in with Viacom's other media properties. The media firm also didn't want to deal with the new challenges facing Blockbuster, such as stiff competition from video on demand services, the cheap DVD market, and mail order video rental company
   <company id="100752">
    Netflix
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In a move designed to simplify the firm's operations and re-focus the company on its core assets, in late 2005 Viacom split into two separately traded firms -- one called CBS Corporation, consisting of traditional television and radio broadcasting operations and headed by former co-COO Les Moonves; and the other called the "new"
   <company id="143020">
    Viacom
   </company>
   , made up of cable television and film operations and headed by former co-COO Tom Freston. (Freston resigned in 2006.) Redstone retained his title as chairman of both firms, as well as his majority control.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shortly after the split, CBS Corp. sold
   <company id="107457">
    Paramount Parks
   </company>
   to
   <company id="10305">
    Cedar Fair
   </company>
   for $1.2 billion. A newly formed network called
   <company id="153120">
    The CW
   </company>
   , a combination of UPN and
   <company id="101420">
    The WB
   </company>
   , debuted in 2006. The following TV season, the CBS network fell from first place in the ratings for the first time in six years. CBS Corp. expanded its online publishing operations in 2008 with the $1.8 billion acquisition of
   <company id="48081">
    CNET Networks
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 production on the eighth season of its hit comedy
   <em>
    Two and a Half Men
   </em>
   ceased as a result of the erratic behavior of actor Charlie Sheen. CBS fired Sheen and has put the show on hiatus for an undetermined period of time.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company spun off its CBS Outdoor Americas advertising business.
