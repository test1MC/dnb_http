   Liquid resources are big assets at Lindsay Corp. The company designs and manufactures irrigation systems primarily for farmers. The Zimmatic brand irrigation system, a self-propelled center-pivot and lateral-move lineup, is designed to use water, energy, and labor more efficiently than traditional flood or surface irrigation equipment. Touting better-to-bumper crop yields, a dealer network sells to farmers in key markets worldwide. (The US represents more than 60% of sales.) Lindsay offers chemical injection systems, water pumping stations (via subsidiary Watertronics), as well as replacement parts. An infrastructure division supplies movable barriers for traffic control and crash cushions for road safety.

  <p>
   With most of its operations residing in the US, Lindsay has production and sales operations in Brazil, China, France, Italy Turkey, South Africa, as well as distribution and sales operations in Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and South Africa.

  <p>
   Lindsay operates through two primary segments. Its largest, irrigation (81% of sales), is responsible for making its irrigation systems and water pumping stations. It also offers repair services and replacement parts. The company's infrastructure segment (19%) makes road safety equipment such as movable barriers for traffic control and crash cushions for road safety.

  <p>
   After achieving milestone revenues in 2013, Lindsay saw its revenues drop during 2014 and 2015. The declines were mainly attributed to weaknesses within its irrigation segment as a result of a decline in the number of irrigation systems sold in the US. Also, international irrigation revenues decreased in 2015 due to declines in revenue from the Middle East, Europe, Latin America, and China regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, Lindsay's net income plunged by 49% from 2014 to 2015 due to the lower revenue coupled with higher selling, general, and administrative expenses. Its operating cash flow also plummeted by 47% during that same time period.

  <p>
   Lindsay invests in its own product portfolio in order to grow. It spends around $3 million to more than $4 million a year in research and development of irrigation products. Its irrigation systems are made to work in harsh environments, such as on steep grades. Among its recent introductions, Lindsay launched a pivot control for smartphones. The application allows farmers to control and monitor their irrigation pivots whenever and wherever they are. Benefits include optimized growing conditions and lower labor costs. R&amp;D expenses related to its roadway infrastructure products are also considerable, averaging more than $3 million annually.

  <p>
   Lindsay Manufacturing was founded in 1955 as a farm equipment repair firm. In 1969 the company introduced its first Zimmatic-brand center-pivot irrigation system. Diversified agricultural firm DEKALB bought Lindsay in 1974. Gary Parker was appointed Lindsay's CEO in 1984, and in 1988 DEKALB spun off the company. Parker retired in 2000.
