   Technip wants to be like catnip to the oil, gas, petrochemical and process industries: that is to say, irresistible. One of Europe's largest engineering and construction firms, Technip builds drilling platforms, pipelines, gas processing plants, refineries, and petrochemical plants. Technip is organized into three business segments: Subsea (umbilicals, risers, and flowlines); Onshore (chemical plants, refineries, mining, and pipelines); and Offshore (oil and gas and wind  platforms). The company also manages some 50 operations centers on five continents, a fleet of more than 30 ships, and several production plants. In 2016 it agreed to merge with
   <company id="103275">
    FMC Technologies
   </company>
   to form a $13 billion company, TechnipFMC.

  <p>
   Compagnie Française d'Etudes et de Construction Technip was founded in 1958 to provide engineering services for refineries and petrochemical facilities in France and its territories.
  </p>
  <p>
   Controlled by the Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP), a state-owned petroleum R&amp;D company, Technip began constructing a liquefied natural gas plant (LNG) in Algeria in 1962, the year the country gained its independence from France. The unit began shipping LNG products to the UK in 1964. It completed a second LNG facility in Algeria in 1972.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, in the late 1950s
   <company id="41759">
    British Petroleum's
   </company>
   Chimie unit developed a process to develop styrene, a chemical compound used in the manufacture of plastics and rubber. In 1968 Technip teamed with the company to develop the process.
  </p>
  <p>
   To gain more business in developing East Bloc countries, in 1972 Technip began accepting new forms of payment. That year in Bulgaria it signed a contract to build an ethylene plant and three downstream units and agreed to take partial payment in plant output.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1976 Technip set up a division dedicated to handling barter-type payments, and it began building two petrochemical complexes in the Soviet Union that year. Though it was paid in cash, Technip agreed to buy the plants' chemicals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Extending its business in Canada, Technip repaired an oil refinery in Newfoundland for
   <company id="54033">
    Petro-Canada
   </company>
   in 1978, and the next year it performed a feasibility study for a LNG plant in the Arctic for the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Demand for new energy facilities took a nosedive in the early 1980s, but Technip still bought financially troubled rival Creusot-Loire in 1984. At the time the French government owned a majority of Technip, primarily through the IFP (40%) and Elf Aquitaine (25%).
  </p>
  <p>
   Facing its own financial problems, Technip cut 30% of its workforce in 1984. That year none of its divisions turned a profit, and the company posted a loss of nearly $150 million. It trimmed its workforce by another 20% in 1985.
  </p>
  <p>
   Coming to the rescue in 1985, Petro-Canada invested in Technip. However, the effort was not enough, and the French government devised a bail-out plan. French banks wrote off several Technip loans and extended fresh credit. Elf Aquitaine, which didn't approve of the plan, was forced to increase its stake to 33%. The rest of the company was owned by the IFP (27%), oil company

    TOTAL
   </company>
   (13%),
   <company id="90731">
    Gaz de France
   </company>
   (13%), and French banks.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1990 the company had been awarded more than 1,000 projects, including 120 fertilizer units, in some 85 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eager to reduce its Technip stake, Elf Aquitaine organized the firm's public offering in 1994. Elf decreased its stake to 12%; the French Petroleum Institute (through its ISIS unit), TOTAL, and Gaz de France remained shareholders. In 1995 the company dropped all but Technip from its name.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Technip won a contract to build a polyethylene factory in Malaysia. The oil slump that year slowed investment in new facilities, but Technip continued to grow. The company gained substantial clout when it bought

    Mannesmann
   </company>
   Demag's petrochemicals, energy, and environmental businesses in 1999. That year it also added units in the Benelux region, Germany, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   To extend its offshore oil and gas operations, Technip took a 30% stake in offshore construction firm
   <company id="47885">
    Coflexip
   </company>
   in 2000. The next year Technip bought controlling stakes in Coflexip and ISIS and moved to combine the three companies under the name Technip-Coflexip. The group sold the subsea well operations business of its Coflexip Stena Offshore unit to marine construction group
   <company id="150502">
    Cal Dive
   </company>
   in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   Late in 2004 Technip inked a $4 billion LNG joint venture deal with Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited II (Qatargas II).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 and 2008 the company grew through acquisitions of other engineering and consulting companies with offshore and oil expertise.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008, Technip acquired Eurodim, a French engineering and consulting company with technological expertise in the offshore oil and liquid natural gas transfer sectors, adding to Technip's experience in mobile systems and equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   It formed a joint venture in 2009 with Norwegian firm
   <company id="91067">
    Statoil
   </company>
   to develop the world's first full-scale floating wind turbine, with a generating capacity of 2.3 MW.
