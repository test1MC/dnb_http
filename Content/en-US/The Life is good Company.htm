   Life certainly sounds good for brothers Bert and John Jacobs, who went from living in their van and subsisting on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to running a $100-million-plus firm in just a few years. The Life is good co-founders sold T-shirts to college students up and down the East Coast before creating the firm's stick-figure mascot, Jake. Life is good got its official start in 1994 and, today, the unconventional company sells casual apparel (T-shirts, lounge pants, boxers) and accessories, caps, backpacks, jewelry, pet gear, and home goods through a handful of company-owned stores, its website, and through more than 4,500 specialty and sporting goods stores in the US, Canada, and 30 other countries.

   The apparel maker is working to extend its retail presence in the US through about 100 independently owned Life is good retail shops that trade exclusively in its namesake merchandise. The stores operate under the banner Genuine Neighborhood Shoppe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Life is good, which has a flagship store in Boston, has also added to its portfolio of products with home goods, wall artwork, and book publishing as the company extends the reach of its global brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's product line has grown from T-shirts to include more than 900 items, including the Good Karma line of organic clothing for men and women. Life is good continues to look for product extensions. Rather than expand wildly, the company has chosen to grow more slowly to maintain its product quality foremost. To this end, in 2013 Life is good partnered with Planet Dog to add to their dog accessories.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through a partnership established with
   <company id="40196">
    Hallmark
   </company>
   in 2012, Life is good is co-branding products for sale throughout the US, Canada, and the Caribbean. Its primary goal, as part of the alliance, is to spread the power of optimism.

   In addition to peddling apparel, Life is good raises funds for The Life is good Kids Foundation through its own branded festivals. It donates 10% of its net profits to The Life is good Kids Foundation, raising more than $10 million for kids to date. Life is good Festivals fund the foundation 100%. In turn, the foundation donates money to charities that support children. Life is good Festivals have raised millions of dollars in recent years and donated to non-profit organizations.
