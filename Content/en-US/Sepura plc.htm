   Sepura knows that communications is a two-way street, especially in emergencies. One of the top manufacturers in its industry, Sepura makes digital commercial two-way TETRA (TErrestrial Trunked RAdio) radios used by emergency and police personnel, the military, and transportation agencies. Private mobile radios (PMRs), less jargonally known as walkie-talkies, are used on TETRA networks in more than 110 countries. In addition to ambulance, fire, and other emergency responders, the company supplies such commercial customers as

   Sepura's revenue increased 12% in 2015 (ended March) from 2013 as it shipped more terminals -- Saudi Arabia was a big destination -- and integrated an acquisition. Net income did revenue three percentage points better, rising 15% in 2014. Higher revenue and lower research and development costs more than offset increases in costs for sales and marketing and distribution. The company reported negative cash flow from operations at the end of 2015.

   In 2014, Sepura acquired Fylde Micro Limited, which develops trunking controllers that simplify the migration from analog to digital networks. The move expands Sepura's product portfolio. In 2015, the company acquired a Spanish walkie-talkie company, Teltronic S.A.U., with the aim of diversifying geographic, especially in Latin America as well as bolster its presence in the US.
