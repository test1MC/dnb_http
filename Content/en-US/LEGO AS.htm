   Toy blocks are the building blocks of success at LEGO. Keeping little hands busy worldwide for decades, LEGO Holding (dba LEGO Group) has made more than 480 billion of its interlocking toys. In a nod to kids' growing high-tech skills, the toymaker offers LEGO Mindstorms to build PC-programmable robots and BIONICLE sets that feature an evolving online story line. Other collections include LEGO Space Police and LEGO City. It makes its
   <em>
    Star Wars
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Indiana Jones
   </em>
   toys under license with
   <company id="47482">
    Lucasfilm
   </company>
   . The group owns namesake retail outlets in the US and Europe and sells its products in more than 130 countries. Vice chairman Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, grandson of the founder, is LEGO's majority shareholder.

   LEGO's revenue rose some 25% to $4.04 billion in 2012 as compared to $3.49 billion in 2011. Net profit increased to $969 million vs. $776 million in 2011.
  </p>
        <p>
   The toy maker has logged revenue increases while its traditional-toy rivals saw sales slide. The company points to the success of its classic toy lines -- LEGO City, LEGO Creator, LEGO Technic, and LEGO
   <em>
    Star Wars
   </em>
   -- for the rise in revenue. Geographically, LEGO expects moderate sales increases in its North American and Western Europe markets.

   LEGO has been working to fine-tune its performance during the past few years. It has done so through product additions, such as the widely successful
   <em>
    Harry Potter
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Star Wars
   </em>
   lines, as well as forming alliances with the

   And it's far from game over for LEGO's videogame business. The company secured the future of its LEGO Universe multiplayer online game as long ago as 2011, when it bought the rights to the game's development from Gazillion Entertainment. LEGO publishes the game, but the move brings its development in-house. To this end, the toy company is working to retain a handful of Universe game developers and their Colorado studio. In 2010 LEGO also extended its licensing agreement with
   <company id="142708">
    Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group
   </company>
   through 2016. The deal, which has developer TT Games Publishing creating LEGO videogames across multiple platforms, gives traction to titles LEGO Star Wars, LEGO Batman: The Videogame, and LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures. Collectively, LEGO has sold nearly 50 million units of the games worldwide.

   In a bid to make it to the big screen, LEGO launched its first full-length DVD movie in 2010 under the
   <em>
    LEGO: The Adventures of Clutch Powers
   </em>
   title. The partnership with

   Fears in the industry concerning toys made in China, which have had an unusually high number of recalls in recent years, has helped to boost LEGO's bottom line further, as LEGO only has a fraction of its production in China. However, in 2013 LEGO announced plans to build and operate a factory in Jiaxing City, China, that will supply products for the growing Asian market. Construction is expected to begin in 2014. This is part of the company's strategy to position production near to its core markets, which include Asia.

   The word LEGO is derived from the Danish words for "play well," and children have been doing so with the company's familiar building blocks for years. The LEGO brick celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008. To boot, LEGO toys were named the Toy of the Century by
   <i>
    FORTUNE
   </i>
   magazine.

   Ole Kirk Christiansen opened a carpentry shop in 1916 in Denmark, and in 1932 began making carved wooden toys. Two years later Ole held a contest among his employees to name the company, from which came LEGO (a combination of two Danish words, "leg" and "godt," meaning "play well"). A fire destroyed the LEGO factory in 1942, but the company quickly resumed manufacturing.
  </p>
        <p>
   The availability of quality plastic following WWII prompted the company to add plastic toys to its line. The predecessor to the common LEGO block was invented in 1949; called Automatic Binding Bricks, they fit on top of each other but did not snap together.
  </p>
        <p>
   After hearing criticism that no company made a comprehensive toy system, in 1954 Ole's son Godtfred assembled a list of 10 product criteria for LEGO's toys, including that they have lots of compatible components. Deciding that the Automatic Binding Bricks had the most potential, the firm launched the first LEGO playset in 1955. It introduced the "stud and tube" snap-together building block in 1958. LEGOs were soon one of the most popular toys in Europe. When a second fire in 1960 destroyed its warehouse for wooden toys, the company ceased production of wooden items in favor of plastics.

   began manufacturing and distributing LEGOs in the US in 1961 under license. LEGO's first LEGOLAND park, built from 42 million LEGO blocks, opened in Billund, Denmark, in 1968. (A UK park followed in 1996, a California park in 1999, and one in Germany in 2002.) By 1973, after relatively lackluster US sales, Samsonite opted not to renew its license, and the LEGO Company set up a sales and production facility in Connecticut. US sales increased tenfold by 1975.
  </p>
        <p>
   Aiming for the preteen market, the company introduced the more-complex LEGO Technic model sets in 1977 and the popular LEGOLAND Space playset two years later. However, LEGO hit a bump when its patent for the LEGO brick expired in 1981 and a slew of knockoffs flooded the market.
  </p>
        <p>
   The first LEGO Imagination Center opened in Minneapolis in 1992, and the second followed in Walt Disney World five years later. Two years later Godtfred died; his son, Kjeld, who changed the spelling of Christiansen to Kristiansen, succeeded him.

   In the 1990s growth of the video game industry far outpaced the growth of the construction toys market, and LEGO suffered. With profits shrinking, in 1998 the company reversed its tradition of avoiding commercial tie-ins; it snapped together an agreement to produce building kits and figures based on the popular
   <i>
    Star Wars
   </i>
   movies and
   <company id="11603">
    Walt Disney
   </company>
   's Winnie the Pooh. However, those events came too late to prevent LEGO from suffering its first loss since the 1930s. The company began cutting up to 10% of its workers in 1999.
  </p>
        <p>
   To build up its interactive, electronic, and educational toy development, LEGO bought smart toys developer Zowie Intertainment in 2000, marking the first time the company purchased another toymaker. In 2001 LEGO inked a deal to create children's online games and activities for software giant
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft Corporation
   </company>
   . However, amid another periodic slump in sales, LEGO announced in 2001 it would cut 500 jobs and discontinue some noncore products.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2003 LEGO entered into the arts and crafts market with the introduction of CLIKITS: a fashion design system made up of a variety of kits allowing girls (ages 6 and up) to design room decor, picture frames, jewelry, and fashion and hair accessories. The product line targeted the 'tween market (girls ages 7-14) and included an initial marketing partnership with Limited Too (a fashion retailer with more than 500 stores nationwide).
  </p>
        <p>
   Facing record losses for 2003, LEGO announced in early 2004 significant changes to both its strategy and management structure. The company refocused on its core LEGO brick product and brand (including a relaunch of its pre-school product line), and downsized its top leadership structure from 14 members to nine. Included in the departures were EVP and COO Poul Plougmann and head of corporate development Francesco Ciccolella. In October co-owner Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen resigned as the company's CEO, but remained on the board as vice chairman. Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, SVP of corporate affairs, was named as his replacement. The move was a result of a slower than expected recovery from its previous year's losses. Later that year the company changed its name from LEGO Company to LEGO Group. It also created LEGO Holding A/S to be parent of both the Danish and Swiss operations of the group.

   The company divested its 44% stake in playground equipment manufacturer KOMPAN in 2004. The next year it sold its LEGOLAND parks, which featured LEGO sculptures, rides, and exhibits, to the
   <company id="43093">

   . It also sold a Swiss tool factory, Lego Werkzeugbau Steinhausen, in 2005.
