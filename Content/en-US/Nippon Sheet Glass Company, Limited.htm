   For Nippon Sheet Glass (NSG), it's not a question of whether the glass is half full or half empty but whether or not it's flat. NSG makes flat glass and glazing products for the automotive and building products markets, including safety glazing and solar control glass for automobiles, noise control and fire protection glazings for buildings, and glass for solar energy panels. It also makes specialty glass for industrial applications, such as fiber optics, thin display glass for lenses and printers, and glass fiber. Customers include construction firms, electronics companies, and automobile makers. NSG owns UK-based glassmaker

   ; it sells its automotive and building products under the Pilkington brand.

  <p>
   The company has manufacturing operations in 28 countries and a sales network in 130 countries. Geographically, 40% of its sales stem from Europe, 26% from Japan, and 16% from North America. The remaining 18% are generated mainly in South America, China, and South East Asia.

  <p>
   NSG's operates through a three-segment organizational structure: Automotive (50% of net sales), Architectural (40%), and Technical Glass (10%). The Pilkington brand has been a key player in the industry for years and is recognized as the company that invented the float glass process, which has become the global standard for manufacturing high-quality glass. (Float glass is made by floating molten glass on molten tin to achieve a flat surface and uniform thickness.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In recent years, NSG has been working to expand its Pilkington-branded product line, particularly in its Architecture segment. Specifically, the segment has been focused on producing glass for the growing solar energy industry. Its offerings include a range of products for photovoltaic modules (used in solar panels found on solar farms and buildings) and solar thermal collectors (for solar heating systems).
  </p>
  <p>
   NSG's smaller specialty glass business represents the company's non-flat glass business. It primarily serves makers of optical products for printers and copiers and niche electronics devices. The segment could potentially grow into a more significant business for the company in the future, however, as NSG looks to attract customers from outside its traditional automotive and building markets. Other growth strategies employed by NSG include expanding its overall presence in emerging markets, including South America and Eastern Europe, through acquisitions.

  <p>
   NSG's net sales climbed 3% from 2014 to 2015 due to growth from its Architectural and Automotive segments. Architectural experienced growth due to cost savings arising from its restructuring program and improved market conditions within North America. Automotive sales were stronger in 2015 due to the impact of translations involving the weaker Japanese yen.

  <p>
   NSG's growth strategy involves restructuring to achieve financial sustainability and transitioning to maintain strategic growth in longer term. It is working to create a more agile, leaner, lower cost organization to become more well-positioned to respond to the changing and diversified global economy.
