   Sometimes it's all right to get loaded. Mayville Engineering Company (MEC) manufactures shotshell reloading machinery and equipment, used by hunters, sport shooting enthusiasts, and sporting goods stores. MEC also provides coating, welding, riveting, painting, manufacturing, prototyping, and mechanical assembly services. Its operations are divided across the main divisions of MEC Tube, MEC Coatings, MEC Fabrication, and MEC Shooting Sports. Overall, these divisions cater to the agricultural, construction, military, medical, and industrial markets.

   In addition to MEC's manufacturing processes, its MEC Coaters division offers coating services which include electrocoating, shot blasting, alodine conversion coating, and liquid painting for military and other diverse commercial applications.

   The company has partnered with the

    National Rifle Association
   </company>
   to provide training to NRA instructors on the operations of their MEC reloaders. Reloading is an environmentally friendly practice since the hulls and brass are recycled in the process.

  <p>
   MEC grows its divisions through the use of acquisitions and in investing in its capital. In 2013 it acquired Missouri-based clay trap machines manufacturer APEX Clay Traps in a deal that allowed MEC to launch a full line of clay target machines, complementing the market presence of its MEC shotshell reloaders. To sell this new product line, the company formed the MEC Shooting Sports group.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 MEC picked up Center Manufacturing, a Michigan-based manufacturer of metal products. Center became a division of the MEC family of companies, and provides additional products and processes through an expanded geographic footprint.
