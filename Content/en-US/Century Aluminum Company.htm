  <p>
   The company operates three US aluminum smelters (in Hawesville, Kentucky, Robards, Kentucky, and Mt. Holly, South Carolina) and one smelter in Grundartangi, Iceland.
  </p>
  <p>
   US operations' shipments were up year-over-year from 472,977 tons in 2013 to 570,600 tons in 2014, due to the acquisitions of the Sebree smelter in 2013 and Mt. Holly in 2014. In Iceland, shipments increased from 291,621 tons in 2013 to 296,525 tons in 2014,  due to increased production capacity as a result of the ongoing expansion project.
  </p>
  <p>
   Century Aluminum's annual primary aluminum production capacity is approximately 1,166,000 tons per year. It produced 881,000 tons of primary aluminum in 2014.

  <p>
   In 2014 the company got 77% of its consolidated sales from its two major customers:
   <company id="101467">
    Glencore
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40437">
    Southwire Company
   </company>
   .

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Century Aluminum's revenues increased by 33% in 2014 thanks to higher shipment volumes, due to production from the Sebree and Mt. Holly smelters and a shift in product mix from toll to direct sales at Grundartangi. Higher price realizations had a positive impact on net sales of $134.2 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 its net income was $112.5 million, a 379% improvement from the previous year's loss. This improvement was caused by higher net sales, decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses due to a reduction in external legal and outside professional service support, and the absence of the relocation and severance expenses. It also saw a gain on fair value of contingent consideration and on the remeasurement of equity investment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities increased by 896%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's strategic objective is to maximize the financial returns by optimizing safety and environmental performance; improving their cost structure for existing assets by managing costs and improving productivity and efficiency; pursuing upstream investment opportunities in bauxite mining, alumina refining and the production of other key operating supplies; and expanding its primary aluminum business by improving and investing in the facilities it owns as well as constructing, investing in, or acquiring additional capacity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Century Aluminum has a history of making acquisitions and it expects to opportunistically seek out further acquisitions in the future.

  </p>
  <p>
   In a similar vein, in 2013 it acquired the Sebree aluminum smelter (with a 205,000-ton capacity) in Kentucky from
