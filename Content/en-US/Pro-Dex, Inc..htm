   Pro-Dex is responsible for that high-pitched whirring sound at the dentist's office. The company designs and manufactures rotary drive systems used in the dental and medical instrument industries. Its motors are used in instruments for arthroscopic, cranial, dental, orthopedic, and spinal surgery. It also markets its own line of dental handpieces under the Micro Motors brand. Pro-Dex also develops motion control systems for industrial manufacturing and scientific research industries under the Oregon Micro Systems brand. In addition to manufacturing, Pro-Dex also offers repair services on its products.

   Pro-Dex primarily sells its products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), with medical components making up about three-fourths of annual revenues. The company receives nearly 90% of revenues from its 20 largest customers, which include

  <p>
   Pro-Dex has manufacturing facilities in Irvine, California, and Beaverton, Oregon (Oregon Micro Systems). Products made at the California plant, including medical and dental devices and the Micro Motors equipment, account for nearly 90% of the company's annual sales. The smaller Oregon facility focuses on motion control systems for automation and research customers.

   Due to its small customer base, the loss of a key client can take a heavy toll on Pro-Dex's financial results. For instance, in fiscal 2012 the company's annual sales figure decreased by 36% to some $17 million, primarily due to reduced revenues from a top customer. This also caused a sharp drop in net income, pushing the company back into the red.

  <p>
   Pro-Dex aims to grow through increased sales of its core medical products to both existing and new customers. The company also seeks to expand its product offerings through research and development efforts, both independently and through partnerships with customers. At the same time, the company has been working to reduce operating costs to improve its returns.
  </p>
  <p>
   For instance, the company reduced its workforce by about 20% during 2011 and 2012 in response to reduced sales volumes from its largest (un-named) customer, which previously accounted for 45% of revenues. The company began preparing for the change in 2010 after the top customer informed Pro-Dex of its decision to manufacture surgical devices previously supplied by Pro-Dex. The firm lost about half of revenues from that customer during fiscal 2012, and it expects to lose another large portion of income from the client in 2013 as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company sold off its Astromec motor business which served the aerospace industry. That sale brought in some $830,000 and allowed Pro-Dex to focus on its medical device and motion control system operations.
