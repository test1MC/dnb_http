   Fusion-io wants to help businesses access data in a flash. The company's ioMemory hardware modules offer storage and processing using an array of flash memory delivered through its proprietary data-path controller and virtual storage layer (VSL) software. VSL allows ioMemory to function as data storage within a server, allowing data access without traditional storage devices. Fusion-io's products are used in sectors such as education, energy, entertainment, financial services, government, and life sciences, among others. The company's three biggest clients have been

   Since the acquisition by Sandisk, Fusion-io's financial results have not been reported. The last full year of results were reported for 2013 when revenue hit a company high of $432 million from about $360 million in 2012. Higher volume of shipped products means higher revenue.

   The company's net loss expanded by about $5 million to $39 million in 2013. Fusion-io fed its sales growth by increasing sales and marketing spending (nearly $260,000 in 2013, up from $120,000 in 2012) and research and development costs. It also higher legal fees because of litigation.

   With Fusion-io on board, SanDisk can accelerate efforts to create a flash-transformed data center for customers. Fusion-io will benefit from SanDisk's vertical integration. (Fusion-io develops software in-house but outsources manufacturing, to Alpha EMS,
