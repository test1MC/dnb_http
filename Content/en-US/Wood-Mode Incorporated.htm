   When it comes time to remodel the kitchen or bath, it's best to get into a Wood-Mode frame of mind. The company manufactures custom and semi-custom cabinets for the kitchen, bathroom, and other areas of the home. It offers a variety of styles, wood selections (cherry, knotty cherry, maple, heartwood maple, oak, and pine), more than 85 standard wood finish colors, hardware, laminates, and mouldings for its customized cabinetry. Wood-Mode can also customize unique finishes to customer specifications. The company sells its products under the Wood-Mode and Brookhaven names through showrooms located in the US, Canada, Mexico, and Bermuda. Privately-owned Wood-Mode has been in business since the 1940s.

   Wood-Mode serves several customer sets, including builders, contractors, architects, remodelers, and interior designers. Rather than selling its cabinetry directly to customers through home improvement retailers, such as
   <company id="11470">
    Home Depot
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10920">
    Lowe's
   </company>
   , Wood-Mode taps the expertise of longtime independent kitchen and bath dealers to peddle its products. Products are sold through these showrooms and more than 600 independent dealers in the US, Canada, Mexico, and Bermuda. It prefers this method of marketing for its more personalized and professional design and installation services.

The company has extended its product range beyond kitchens and bathrooms to closets and wardrobes, entertainment centers, home offices, and bars and fireplaces.
