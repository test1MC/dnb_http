   Plexus flexes its manufacturing muscles in doing contract work for customers in a wide range of businesses. The company develops and manufactures electronic products for companies in the telecommunications, medical, industrial, and defense markets. Plexus does product design, assembly, and testing of printed circuit boards (PCBs), test equipment, and other electronic components. The company also offers prototyping, materials procurement, warehousing and distribution, and other support services. Major customers include
   <company id="16536">
    Arris Group
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   . Plexus gets most of its sales from customers in the US and Malaysia. The Neenah, Wisconsin-based company was founded in 1979.

  <p>
   Plexus's healthcare and life sciences unit abd the industrial and commercial unit each supply about 30% of revenue. Another 23% of revenue comes from its networking and communications products while the unit focused on defense, security, and aerospace supplies 16%.

  <p>
   Plexus operates more than a dozen manufacturing and engineering facilities in China, Malaysia, Mexico, Romania, the UK, and the US (in Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, North Carolina, and Wisconsin). The company closed its Fremont, California plant in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Customers in the US generate 43% of the company's revenue and another 32% comes from customers in Malaysia. China is the third biggest market for Plexus, accounting for 12% of sales.

  <p>
   Altogether Plexus has manufacturing contracts with about 140 customers. Some 59% of sales comes from Plexus' top 10 customers, so losing just one could put a significant dent in revenue. Its biggest customers are
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="14116">
    Micron Technology
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="16536">
    ARRIS Group
   </company>
   each supplying about 10% of revenue.

  <p>
   Revenue at Plexus slipped 4% in 2016 (ended October) to $2.6 billion from $2.7 billion in 2015. Revenue from the networking and communications segment plunged 29%. The losses of two customers and lower end-user demand for another customer resulted in striking about $196 million from Plexus's sales compared to 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 net income decreased 19% to about $76 million compared to $94 million in 2015. Reduced revenue and restructuring charges related to the closure of its manufacturing plant in Fremont, California combined to reduce profit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations surged to about $128 million in 2016 from about $77 million in 2015.

  <p>
   Flexibility is key for Plexus, whether it means reconfiguring a production line to make another product or expanding and contracting manufacturing space. In 2015, Plexus closed its Fremont, California manufacturing plant to align its resources with the end-market needs of its customers. The closure cost Plexus about $5 million. The company also consolidated its manufacturing facilities in Wisconsin and in Mexico.
  </p>
  <p>
   Plexus' sales and profits rely on demand from customers and end-users, as well as the mix of products produced for its customers. The company's strategy is to focus on mid-to-low volume, higher complexity turnkey programs focusing on flexibility, technology, quality, and adhering to regulatory requirements. It also offers value-added services such as logistics management and repair services. In addition, it segments its R&amp;D, with teams dedicated to each of its target sectors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to boosts its business in the European, Middle East, and Africa market (about 6% of revenue), Plexus is investing in an Environmental Stress Screening facility at its Kelso, Scotland, manufacturing operation. The investment includes specialized equipment and dedicated ESS engineers. The move provides an in-house service to customers in its expanding defense, security, and aerospace sectors, and the oil and gas industry.

  <p>
   In the 1970s Peter Strandwitz needed a contract electronics manufacturer when his small electronics business suffered from a lack of engineering expertise. He founded Plexus in 1979 and marketed its services to electronics companies that could not efficiently operate their own manufacturing facilities. The company went public in 1986. Three years later it discontinued its faltering International Communications subsidiary, which made pay phones, to concentrate on its core business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Plexus grew throughout the early 1990s, and in 1994 doubled its manufacturing capabilities with a new facility in Neenah, Wisconsin. In 1996 Plexus and Oneida Nation Electronics, a company owned by the Native American Oneida tribe, built an electronics fabrication plant in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The next year, Plexus acquired NEI Electronics and computer parts maker Tertronics.
