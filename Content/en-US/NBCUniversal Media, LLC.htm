   NBCUniversal, like other media conglomerates such as
   <company id="102518">
    Time Warner
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41816">
    News Corporation
   </company>
   , is focused on using its numerous distribution channels to maximize the profit potential of its creative content. However, the company has been beleaguered by uneven performance at the box office and low ratings for its broadcast network. The recession has also had a negative impact on advertising revenue and home entertainment DVD sales.

  <p>
   NBCUniversal has turned significant focus toward digital entertainment and online media distribution to capitalize on new technologies. The company has an almost 30% stake in video streaming site Hulu.
