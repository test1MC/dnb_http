   As part of SAC, Diversey expands its parent's business both geographically and operationally, beyond specialty packaging solutions, into the chemical cleaning and hygiene marketplace. In 2012 Diversey launched a track treatment system called Dicolube Sustain for the brewing and beverage industry. The new product aims to offer advantages in production line hygiene and lubrication while also reducing water usage.

   Prior to 2011 Diversey had completed a reorganization following a wave of consolidation and globalization among its customers. Among the changes, Diversey reduced its worldwide workforce and exited certain services to health and hospitality customers. The company closed a number of facilities, including its principal US manufacturing site located in Sturtevant, Wisconsin. Diversey moved production to other locations in North America, or contracted out manufacture of certain product lines.
