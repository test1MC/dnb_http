   Despite the sluggish automotive industry environment, Akebono Brake is accelerating its OEM brake manufacturing operations. In 2013 the company initiated an $82 million expansion of its Clarksville, Tennessee, location in order to improve its manufacturing processes, increase its depth of manufacturing, and offer its customers a more diversified product portfolio.
