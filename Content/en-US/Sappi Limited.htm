   When it comes to paper, Sappi Limited is actually unlimited. The company is one of the world's top producers of coated fine papers, such as those used in books, magazines, brochures, and annual reports, among many applications. Fine paper, coated and uncoated, is the company's principal product; about 6 million tons of paper are churned out annually. Its Forest Products business produces kraft pulp, containerboard, packaging paper, and newsprint, as well as plantation timber. Sappi is also a big producer of chemical cellulose, used to make acetated tow and viscose fiber. The company owns and manages forestland in South Africa. Its distribution arm, Sappi Trading, sells products outside of Sappi's core markets.

  <p>
   Sappi operates a network for the sale and distribution of its products outside its core operating regions of North America, Europe, and Southern Africa. The company's customers are usually large paper merchants. It also targets the food and drink markets, print and publishers, corporate paper buyers, and graphic designers.

  <p>
   From 2014 to 2015, Sappi's revenues decreased 11% due primarily to reduced demand for coated paper in Europe. Weaker Euro and Rand currencies relative to the US dollar also impacted the decrease.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's profits increased by 24% from 2014 to 2015 due to decreased variable manufacturing and delivery costs and fixed costs that were partially offset by decreased sales.
