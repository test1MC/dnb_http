It supplies private-brand baked goods for retailers, as well as the contract-manufacture of custom goods for the supplemental, new-product, and seasonal baking needs of regional and national food manufacturers. Through its ABC Bakers unit, the company has been a

   doesn't breakout sales for Interbake Foods, it reported that 2013 biscuit sales -- which include the sale of wafers, ice cream cones, cookies, and crackers -- accounted for about 19% of Weston Foods' sales, up from about 18% in 2012. Thanks to higher volumes among cookies and ice cream cones and pricing and changes in the sales mix, biscuit sales rose 5% during the reporting period. The company's new product launches, including Mrs. Fields-branded pre-packaged cookies, began to prop up sales beginning in Q4 2012.

In 2014 the pair rolled out Nibblers miniature cookies in grocery stores. Previously, Nibblers were only available for purchase through catalogs, online, and through Mrs. Fields kiosks.
