   Idera Pharmaceuticals, a clinical-stage biotech firm, is developing DNA and RNA therapies that manipulate the immune system's response to disease. It is focused on Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) -- immune cell receptors that recognize and respond to viral and bacterial invaders. Some of Idera's drugs (such as treatments for infectious disease and cancer) mimic those invaders to stimulate an immune response; others (including treatments for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases) target TLRs to suppress the immune response. The firm's lead candidate is IMO-8400. Idera conducts some of its R&amp;D efforts through partnerships.

  <p>
   The firm also has a drug discovery technology platform to inhibit the production of disease-associated proteins. Other pipeline products include IMO-2125 and IMO-2055 (for the treatment of cancer). Idera owns about 50 US patents and patent applications; it has more than 80 patents in other countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Idera depends on third parties for the manufacturing of its drug candidates.

   The company's bread and butter comes from collaborative and license agreements. In 2015, revenue increased 241% to $0.3 million, thanks to its collaboration agreement with
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   to develop and commercialize candidates for treating renal disease. However, Idera is still losing money every year, with the exception of 2002, 2008, and 2009 when collaboration earnings outweighed expenses. In 2015, net loss increased 26% to $48 million as R&amp;D expenses and other costs related to the development of its pipeline products rose. At the end of the year, Idera's accumulated deficit totaled $500.1 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow increased in 2015, rising 37% to $43 million thanks to the higher net loss.

   </company>
   , GlaxoSmithKline, Abbott Molecular, The Myositis Association, and
   <company id="11326">
    Merck

   . The agreements cover a range of drug discovery processes and target a variety of diseases.

  <p>
   In 2015, Idera's R&amp;D expenses increased 23% to $34 million.
