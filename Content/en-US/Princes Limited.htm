In addition to its namesake and private-label lines, Princes owns an array of food and drink brands and produces and distributes a handful of labels under license, including Shippam's, Napolina, Aqua-Pura, Crosse &amp; Blackwell, and Farrow's. Both the products that it sources and makes are supplied to grocery and foodservice markets in the UK and Europe. Princes is part of Japanese trading giant

   In line with Mitsubishi's plans, Princes focuses on expanding its product portfolio along with its geographic presence in the UK and Europe by further enhancing its capabilities in terms of a stable product supply and upgrading its ability to respond to customers, such as major retailers.

   In 2016 Princes invested again in its Bradford soft drinks factory as part of an ongoing program of upgrading its manufacturing operations. The move, which has seen Princes install a new Ready To Drink bottling line, follows investment over the past two years including the launch of a new on-site warehouse and state-of-the-art ingredients processing center. The new line produces 250ml and 500ml bottles, increasing the capacity at the site and giving scope for further growth and development of new products. The installation of a new Ready to Drink bottling line opens up additional capacity to meet consumer demand for Princes' products and to develop new ones.

   In 2013 the company signed a supply partnership agreement with Pastificio Guido Ferrara SPA (Ferrara), a leading Italian producer of dried pasta. The agreement is part of a strategy to more than double Princes' sales of customer own brand and branded pasta in the European market over the next five years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company acquired a 51% stake in a major Italian canned tomato processor, AR Industrie Alimentari SpA. The deal, which Princes hopes will double its revenue in Europe by 2017, created a new company: Princes Industrie Alimentari SrL, and included a factory in Foggia that can handle 400,000 tons of tomatoes a year. Princes looks to gain broad control over securing tomato supplies as well as processing and selling tomato products in the European market.

   Within days of the agreement, Princes sold off its Fray Bentos brand (canned meat pies) and manufacturing assets to Scots company

   ' canned grocery business in mid-2011. Prices acquired two of the major UK food producer's canning sites, and the Crosse &amp; Blackwell, Farrow's, and Smedley's name brands. As part of the deal, Princes inked a long-term licensing pact to can baked beans and pasta under the Branston and Batchelor's labels, which Premier retained.
