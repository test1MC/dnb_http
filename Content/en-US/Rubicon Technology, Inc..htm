   Sapphires are the jewel in Rubicon Technology's crown. Using proprietary crystal growth technology, Rubicon makes sapphire materials, wafers, and components for a variety of products. In the field of optoelectronics, the vertically integrated company makes sapphire components for light-emitting diodes (LEDs) used in cell phones, video screens, and other items. Rubicon's sapphire materials also are used for compound semiconductor manufacturing and laser imaging. In the telecom sector, the company's silicon materials are in demand for the silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) components of cellular and fiber-optics products. The majority of its sales are to customers in Asia.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Rubicon operates two manufacturing plants, a 130,000 sq.-ft. plant in the US (Illinois) and a smaller 65,000 sq.-ft. one in Malaysia. The Malaysian plant processes the sapphire grown at the Illinois plant into finished cores and wafers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Asian countries such as China, Taiwan, and Korea account for about 60% of sales; Australia and the US contribute another 25% and about 10%, respectively.

  <p>
   The company uses a direct sales model; its primary customers are semiconductor device manufacturers and wafer polishing companies. Because its products are custom designed, Rubicon relies on a small number of customers. In 2013,
   <company id="122608">
    Peregrine Semiconductor
   </company>
   and China-based Nanjing J-crystal Photoelectric Technology Co. together accounted for 45% of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its sapphire materials are sold in core, as-cut, as-ground, and polished forms in two-, three-, four-, six- and eight-inch diameters, as well as optical materials sold as blanks or polished windows.

  <p>
   It's been a bumpy road for Rubicon as sales are dependent on the LED market. Overall sales fell 38% in 2013 to $41 million. That year there was reduced demand for large diameter substrates; however, sales were stronger for its smaller diameter core products sold into the LED lighting market. The company expects demand for its LED chips to strengthen throughout 2014 as more companies use LED lighting.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rubicon has been unprofitable for two years as it costs more to make sapphire substrates (manufacturing materials, labor, utilities, rent, freight, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, and warranties) than what it earns.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following a similar trajectory as net income, cash flow from operations is currently significantly lower than the $24 million reported in 2010 and 2011. In fact, in 2013 the company brought in only $400 thousand, although that's better than the loss of about $3 million in 2012.

   Rubicon is counting on LED technology going into more consumer electronics. The LEDs made with Rubicon's sapphires provide the lens cover, dual flash, and home button on smartphones. LEDs made with sapphire also equip the backlighting units of notebook computers, desktop monitors, and LCD TVs. LEDs are additionally being used more for automobile headlights, taillights, and even interior lighting. Another growing market for LEDs -- and Rubicon's sapphire -- is large and outdoor commercial signage.
  </p>
  <p>
   Radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs) that need sapphire to be manufactured offer more opportunities for Rubicon's materials. Among the products that use RFICs needing Rubicon's sapphire are mobile phones, broadband television set-top boxes, and satellites.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rubicon has additionally discovered a window of opportunity in the transportation and military sectors. Its sapphire and fluoride materials are in demand for transparent armor in military vehicles and for special windows used for steering aircraft in conditions of low visibility.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another application of sapphire materials is for blue laser diodes, which are increasingly being used in Blu-ray DVD players and advanced video game systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   To grow with its market, Rubicon is developing larger sapphire wafers that will be needed for producing next-generation LEDs and RFICs. Rubicon also projects more demand as the electronics and optical industries create new products that require sapphire and other single-crystal products for manufacturing. Additionally Rubicon sees more market opportunities in the aerospace, petroleum, and laser industries, which are replacing glass and quartz with sapphire for high-performance and harsh-environment uses.
