   Ken's Foods has focused on developing and rolling out more health-conscious items as it works to provide products with more straight-forward ingredient lists and dressings with enhanced functionality. Catering to customers who are looking to boost their heart health and reduce fat or sodium intake, Ken's Foods has launched several new dressings in recent years. Its Ken's Steak House Healthy Options Salad Dressing is available in several varieties -- from Balsamic Vinaigrette to Raspberry Walnut -- and contains omega-3s sourced from fish oil.

   line of dressings and sauces, acting as a private labeler and bottler.
