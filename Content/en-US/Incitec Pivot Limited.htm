   Incitec Pivot likes to help things grow up and blow up. Australia's largest producer of fertilizers, the company's main products are phosphate-based fertilizers (ammonium phosphates and super-phosphates, primarily); it also produces urea and anhydrous ammonia. Incitec Pivot manufactures industrial chemicals -- for water treatment and process manufacturing -- using by-products from the manufacturing process. Its

   The company operates 20 plants in the US, Canada, Australia, Mexico, Indonesia, and Turkey, and it has joint venture operations in South Africa, Malaysia, China, and Australia. Australia is its largest market, representing 62% of its net sales, while the US accounts for almost 26%.

   is a leading supplier of industrial explosives and blasting services to the mining, quarrying, seismic and construction industries in North America and to the mining industry in Asia/Pacific (primarily in Australia).

  <p>
   In 2014 the company's revenues declined by 2% due to lower global fertilizer prices and drought conditions in the northern region of Australia. Explosives revenues were higher, driven by sales growth to Moranbah customers and favorable foreign currency transactions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income decreased by 33% that year due to a steeper decline in revenues and higher operating costs.

  <p>
   Incitec Pivot's strategy is to take advantage of the demand opportunities stemming from the industrialization and urbanization of China and the shale gas boom in the US by leveraging its core nitrogen and high explosives chemicals manufacturing expertise.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it announced an investment of $850 million to build an 800,000 metric ton per year ammonia plant in Louisiana. The project is on track for production in 2016, and is expected to double the earnings of the Dyno Nobel Americas business.

  <p>
   The company was formed in 2003 through the merger of fertilizer makers Incitec and Pivot; Orica had owned 70% of Incitec Pivot until it sold that majority stake in 2006.
