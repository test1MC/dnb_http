   This publisher is focused on the basics in life: death and taxes. One of Europe's leading professional publishers, Wolters Kluwer disseminates information on legal and regulatory affairs; tax and accounting; financial and compliance services; and health. The firm publishes content through print and electronic formats, and also offers software and services. Customers include lawyers, doctors, tax advisors, business executives, and students. Wolters Kluwer has operations in more than 40 countries, primarily in Europe and North America. The company traces its roots back to 1836 when Jan Berend Wolters opened his bookshop. He later merged his business with Æbele Kluwer's Dutch publishing house.

  <p>
   Emerging markets represent an area of focus for the company.  About 7% of Wolters Kluwer's revenues come from developing markets, including Central and Eastern Europe. The company is specifically expecting growth to come from China, where that market will likely experience more regulation and compliance requirements in order to support a rapidly expanding economy.

  <p>
   A pioneer of the Dutch publishing industry, J. B. Wolters founded his publishing house in 1836 to provide instructional material for Netherlands schools. The company later merged with educational publisher Noordhoff (founded in 1858). J. B. Wolters had no children, so the business went to his brother-in-law E. B. Horst in 1860. Dutch academic Anthony Schepman took over the management of Wolters-Noordhoff in 1917 and led the business' expansion. In 1920 it opened an office in the Dutch colony of Indonesia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wolters-Noordhoff and Information and Communication Union (ICU) merged in 1972. ICU had been formed by the 1970 merger of Samson (founded by Nicholaas Samson in 1883 to print government publications) and publisher A. W. Sijthoff. After the Wolters-Noordhoff-ICU merger, the resulting company initially took the ICU name, but in 1983 it became the Wolters Samson Group. That year it began exploring a merger with Kluwer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Abele Kluwer, a former assistant schoolteacher, became a publisher in 1889. His publishing house specialized in educational products and children's books. The company expanded its range in the 1920s with a growing number of up-to-date publications regarding new laws, regulations, court decisions, and scholarly texts. Kluwer hired its first non-family managing director, J. M. Gorter, in 1957 and went public in 1967.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reed Elsevier (now called
   <company id="41830">
    RELX Group plc
   </company>
   ) made a bid to acquire Kluwer in 1987, buying a minority stake in the company. The Anglo-Dutch concern was rebuffed by the subsequent merger of Wolters Samson with Kluwer that year, however, and was left with about a third of the shares in the new Wolters Kluwer. Despite Reed Elsevier's repeated advances to work closely with Wolters Kluwer, the company pursued an independent growth strategy. In 1990 it acquired J.B. Lippincott, a US health care publisher. That year Reed Elsevier sold its stake in the firm.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the early 1990s Wolters Kluwer began acquiring several midsized European companies and in 1995 bought Commerce Clearing House (with roots dating back to 1892). In 1997 it agreed to an $8.8 billion acquisition deal from Reed Elsevier; however, the deal fell apart the following year. (Both companies blamed regulatory hurdles for the pact's failure.) Meanwhile, Wolters Kluwer bought Waverly (medical and scientific books and magazines) and Plenum Publishing (scientific and technical trade books and journals). It also bought Ovid Technologies, a provider of electronic information retrieval services to the academic, medical, and scientific markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year Wolters Kluwer acquired US professional information publisher Bureau of Business Practice and search and retrieval service Accusearch. In late 1999 internal candidate Casper van Kempen replaced C.J. Brakel as chairman; he was out six months later, having clashed with the board over the company's Web strategy. Deputy chairman Robert Pieterse was tapped to replace him. Also in 2000 Wolters Kluwer announced that it would invest some $240 million in Internet-related operations. The company divested itself of its professional training business that year. In 2001 the company bought Cutter Environment, a unit of Cutter Information, which was folded into its Aspen Publishers unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wolters Kluwer sold the health care book division of its Aspen Publishing unit in late 2002 to Jones and Bartlett Publishers. In addition, Wolters Kluwer sold its academic publishing unit (Kluwer Academic Publishers) for $582 million to two London-based equity firms. The company bought US financial services and information firm GainsKeeper Inc. in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pieterse left the company in 2003 and was replaced by board member Nancy McKinstry. The company made two acquisitions in 2003: CEDAM, an Italian legal publisher, and TyMerix, a legal e-billing service in the US. In 2004 the company's corporate and financial services unit acquired software maker Summation Legal Technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company announced it would group all of its financial businesses under the name Wolters Kluwer Financial Services. Acquisitions in 2005 included Italian publishers De Agostini Professionale and Utet Professionale, as well as Romanian legal publisher EON.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under the direction of CEO Nancy McKinstry, the company focused on regaining its financial health after battling a multiyear advertising slump. Wolters Kluwer cut some 1,500 jobs at the company as part of a three-year restructuring plan, which it completed in 2006.  That year, it acquired ProVation Medical, a provider of medical documentation, coding, and workflow tools. The company sold its Education division to
   <company id="134139">
    Bridgepoint Capital Limited
   </company>
   for €774 million ($997.6 million) in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008, Wolters Kluwer purchased UK and Ireland assets of Australian business software house
   <company id="106602">
    MYOB Limited
   </company>
   for £35.5 million. Also in 2008 the company's Tax and Accounting division acquired Irish risk-management software developer Ci3; and its Legal, Tax &amp; Regulatory division acquired Addison Software and Service, a software solutions provider for the German tax market. Later that year its Health division purchased the US-based UpToDate Inc., which provides online information to doctors on how to diagnose and treat patients.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year Wolters acquired AXENTIS, a US-based provider of enterprise-wide governance, risk, and compliance management solutions, in order to beef up its tax and accounting holdings. Also in 2009, as a result of the challenging economy, Wolters implemented a cost-saving program in 2009 called the Springboard operational excellence program. The program included standardizing technology platforms and consolidating IT infrastructure, streamlining content manufacturing processes, expanding global sourcing programs, creating offshore service centers for software development and testing, and content production and back-office support functions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company refinanced some €850 million ($1,095.6 million) in debt, including a €250 million ($320 million) private placement, in 2010.
