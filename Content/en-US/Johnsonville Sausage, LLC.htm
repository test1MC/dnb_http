   The company entered another product category in 2013, when it added fully cooked and skillet-ready meatballs in three flavors and sausage slices in two flavors. Johnsonville Sausage sells the products in grocers' freezer sections.

   To sustain its export sales, Johnsonville tailors its sausage to fit national tastes. For example, in Canada, the company's bratwursts are flavored with honey and garlic. In Mexico its meats are made extra spicy. And in Asian markets, its brats are smaller, less salty, and have a lemon taste.
