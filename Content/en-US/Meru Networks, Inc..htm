    Financial Performance
   </b>
        </p>
        <p>
   Meru saw its revenues grow by 8% in 2012 thanks to higher demand for products, primarily in the Asia-Pacific region and the UK. Support and services revenues grew by 28% due to increased product sales including higher first-year support sales, and the renewal of support contracts by existing customers. The company's products revenues increased by 9% due to higher unit shipments.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company reports  a growth in net loss ($31.1 million in 2012 compared to a $26.7 million net loss in 2011) due to higher operating expenses. These included higher research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative costs due to an increase in research and development personnel costs, higher facility expenses and an increase in depreciation expenses related to the company's expansion in India.
  </p>
        <p>
   Thanks to increased international sales and an expanding customer base the company has seen an upward trend in revenues from 2008 to 2012. However it has also reported an annual net loss during this time period due to increased operating expenses.

    Strategy
   </b>
        </p>
        <p>
   Meru is expanding into new markets -- including finance, government, technology, telecommunications, transportation, and utilities -- that are more and more understanding of the strategic benefits of wireless networks. The company is also ready to tap more clients in its traditional markets.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2013 major distributor Westcon Group, announced plans to expand its distribution of Meru virtualized Wi-Fi solutions into Mexico and Brazil, effective immediately. (The two companies have distribution arrangements in more than 17 countries, including Brazil, Canada, Italy, Mexico, Spain, the UK, and the US).
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 Meru teamed up with classroom management and monitoring software provide LanSchool, to offer a Wi-Fi based uninterrupted learning management solution for classroom, school, campus or district-wide uses.
  </p>
        <p>
   Growing its US sales operations, in 2012 Meru expanded with a new facility in Tampa, Florida's Westshore Business District.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company is also focused on international expansion as it rides the wave of strong sales across Europe and Asia. That year it also announced expansion plans in Australia focusing on target markets such as education, enterprise, government, healthcare,  and hospitality, by working with its Australian distributor, Wavelink, to expand services and establish a team of Meru sales professionals in the area.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2011 Meru partnered with European IT distributor Azlan to increase its penetration in that market.

    Mergers and Acquisitions
   </b>
        </p>
        <p>
   Meru has also used acquisitions to strengthen its network access offerings. In 2011, it bought Manchester, UK-based network guest access provisioning company Identity Networks. The purchase better enables the company to help enterprises manage their networks in an increasingly bring-your-own-device (BYOD) landscape populated by both employees and customers.
