   OFS wants to be your office furniture source. The company, which makes, sells, and leases office furniture, sells premade case goods (such as desks, bookcases, filing cabinets), seating, and conference room furniture. Its brands include namesake OFS, as well as Carolina, Loewenstein, and First Office. OFS also makes custom office furniture and display cases. Furniture is produced at plants in North Carolina and hauled by its Styline Logistics subsidiary, which transports furniture for OFS, as well as other manufacturers. OFS has showrooms in half a dozen major US cities. The company, which remains family-owned, was founded in 1937 as a wood furniture manufacturer.

   The office furniture firm operates seven manufacturing facilities and four support plants for its portfolio of businesses: OFS, First Office, Carolina, Loewenstein, and Styline Logistics.
  </p>

   OFS boasts furniture-making plants in Archdale and High Point, North Carolina. It has office furniture showrooms in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, New York, Santa Monica, and Washington, DC. It added a new showroom in Manhattan in 2013.

  <p>
   With the economy on the mend and unemployment easing, the office furniture company is expanding its plant in High Point, North Carolina, with plans to hire nearly 190 workers and invest $9.3 million by 2018. The plan calls for the consolidation of four facilities in nearby Archdale with operations at High Point and roughly double the size of the High Point plant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Anticipating the slowdown in demand that occurred as a result of the economic crisis, OFS in 2009 reduced its operational expenses and consolidated production. The company works to make its furnishings more enticing to prospective buyers (especially those with an environmentally conscious bent). In 2009 the company achieved GREENGUARD certification for all of its brands. The GREENGUARD Environmental Institute recognizes companies for using low chemical-emitting products to improve indoor air quality.
