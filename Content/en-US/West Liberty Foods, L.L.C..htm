   Turkey is the main dish at West Liberty Foods, but the company has room for other meats on its plate as well. In addition to slaughtering and processing turkeys, the company also prepares and slices pork, chicken, ham, beef, and cheese into value-added meat products, such as luncheon meat and deli trays. It serves retail and foodservice customers, including the

  <p>
   On average each production facility processes about 4 million pounds of turkey, pork, chicken, and beef on a weekly basis. The company also processes some 20,000 large tom turkeys per day.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its business, West Liberty is a private label manufacturer and co-packs value-added pre-sliced proteins, such as turkey, pork, beef, and chicken, and individually quick frozen chicken and beef items.

   West Liberty has been upgrading and expanding its facilities. In 2016, the company opened a 75,000 sq. ft. cold storage and distribution facility for Liberty Cold.

  <p>
   In 2014 it opened a manufacturing facility in Bolingbrook, Illinois via an acquisition.

  <p>
   In 2013 the company added 34,000 sq. ft. of manufacturing and storage space to its Tremonton plant in response to an increase in demand. The move added 10 million pounds of annual production capacity to the facility. It also bumped up its square footage at the plant by another 8,400 to accommodate a new high-pressure pasteurization system. A similar system was also added to the Mount Pleasant facility.

   In 1996, the Iowa Turkey Growers Cooperative was formed by 47 Iowa-based turkey growers and purchased the West Liberty, Iowa, facility formerly owned by Oscar Mayer, and began to run the business as West Liberty Foods. The first turkeys were processed by the cooperative in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   The West Liberty facility was first established in 1943 by Louis Rich.
