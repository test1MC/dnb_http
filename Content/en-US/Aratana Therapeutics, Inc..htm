   If you can't teach old dogs new tricks, you can at least ease their stiff joints with medications by Aratana Therapeutics. The company is developing biopharmaceuticals for dogs and cats by licensing pharmaceutical compounds already approved for human consumption and reformulating them for animal use. Aratana has three products in the works -- to treat osteoarthritis pain and inflammation in dogs, boost appetite in cats and dogs, and alleviate post-operative pain in cats and dogs. The company expects these products to be ready for market in the US and Europe by 2016. Founded in 2010, Aratana Therapeutics went public in mid-2013, raising $57.5 million.

  <p>
   Aratana Therapeutics plans to use the IPO proceeds to commercialize its current drug candidates by establishing a direct sales force in the US and for in-licensing and developing other drug candidates.

   and Japan-based RaQualia Pharma Inc. Should the medications be approved for use in the US and Europe, Aratana Therapeutics won't be a manufacturer but will hire contract manufacturers. Pacira is already lined up to make the drug for relieving post-operative pain.
