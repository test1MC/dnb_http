   To heck with verbs, Seattle Genetics is conjugating antibodies and drugs to fight cancer. The company's technologies use genetically engineered monoclonal antibodies (MAbs, or single source proteins) to trigger cell death in some cancers, but when they can't do it alone, Seattle Genetics pairs them up with drugs using its Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) technology for a one-two punch. Its first product, Adcetris, gained
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval in 2011 for the treatment of lymphoma in specific patient categories. With partner
   <company id="51240">
    Millennium Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   , the company is working to expand Adcetris' indications. Seattle Genetics also licenses its ADC technology to larger drugmakers to develop their own new cancer therapies.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Adcetris is sold in 30 countries, including in the European Union, the US, Canada, and Switzerland.

        <p>
   The approval of Adcetris (brentuximab) in 2011 was limited to very specific patient categories -- Hodgkin lymphoma patients who have failed to respond to cell transplants or multiple chemotherapy regimens, and patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) after at least one unsuccessful round of chemotherapy. Commercial approval was big for the company, however, with sales of Adcetris making up 46% of its revenues that year.

   Seattle Genetics' revenues increased by 122% in 2012 thanks to higher product sales in Canada and an increase in collaboration and license agreement revenues though its collaboration with Millennium. It also also gained revenues from royalties its
   <company id="51240">

   </company>
   deal outside of the US. Millennium accounted for more than 50% of Seattle Genetics' revenues in 2012.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's net loss dropped by 64% in 2012 thanks to higher revenues and partially due to income from investments. This was  partially offset by an increase in expenses from research and development (clinical expenses and share-based compensation costs) and selling, general and administrative costs.

   Seattle Genetics is working diligently to expand the drug's approved uses; Adcetris is also in clinical trials for conditions including certain types of residual Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphomas.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company regularly looks to partner with other biotech firms to carry its candidates further. It has teamed up with Millennium to help fund the advancement of Adcetris through clinical trial and commercialization stages. In the partnership, Seattle Genetics retains commercial rights to Adcetris in the US, its territories, and Canada, and Millennium holds rights for the rest of the world. In 2012 the Seattle Genetics and Millennium duo teamed up again, this time with

   , a
   <company id="41787">

  </p>
        <p>
   Other candidates under development include ASG-5ME, which is being researched and developed with
   <company id="56281">
    Astellas Pharma
   </company>
   subsidiary Agensys for pancreatic and prostate cancer, and SGN-75, which is in trials for metastatic renal cell carcinoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In addition to its clinical candidates, the firm has several preclinical products in its pipeline. Other co-development research partners include Oxford BioTherapeutics (to jointly discover novel ADCs for treating cancer) and
   <company id="103325">
    Genmab
   </company>
   (to use ADC technology in combination with its HuMax TF and CD74 antibodies for specific targets on tumors and malignancies).
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2013 Seattle Genetics entered into a new antibody-drug conjugate collaboration with
   <company id="116564">
    Bayer HealthCare
   </company>
   , under which Bayer has worldwide rights to utilize Seattle Genetics' ADC technology. Tthat year the company also Seattle Genetics has exercised an option to co-develop an ADC under the companies' existing ADC collaboration agreement with Agensys.
  </p>
        <p>
   Outlicensing deals for the ADC technology are germane to Seattle Genetics' marketing strategy and have netted the company most of its annual revenue figures to date. Licensees have included

   In 2010 the company ended a collaboration with Genentech that focused on developing its SGN-40 candidate, dacetuzumab, and the program has since been halted.
