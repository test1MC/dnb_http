   Thermon Group's heating products are not merely pipe dreams. Through its subsidiaries, Thermon provides specialized cables, tubes, and control systems used in electric and steam "heat tracing," which involves externally applying heat to industrial-grade pipes, tanks, and instrumentation. Its core customers include energy, chemical, and power generation companies that use Thermon's products to maintain temperatures of materials transported or stored in pipes and vessels, as well as for freeze protection in harsh environments. The company's customers have included dozens of multinational giants like

  <p>
   Thermon operates through a global network of some 30 sales, engineering, and other offices in cities across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. It also operates four manufacturing facilities located in San Marcos, Texas; Calgary, Canada; Pijnacker, the Netherlands; and Koregon Bhima, India.

  <p>
   The company markets its products to customers around the world that are constructing brand new facilities, as well as those performing maintenance on, updating, or expanding existing facilities. It has a team of nearly 150 direct sales agents and a network of over 100 independent sales agents and distributors in more than 30 countries.

  <p>
   After posting milestone revenues of $309 million and record-setting profits of $49 million in 2016, Thermon saw these totals drop 9% and 53% to $282 million and $23 million, respectively. The dip in profits was attributed to the lower revenues coupled with expenses associated with acquisitions. Cash flow from operations dipped slightly from $52 million in 2015 to $48 million in 2016 mostly due to the decrease in profits.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue drop for 2016 was driven by declines in its organic Canadian operations, which was negatively impacted by $20 million due to the strong US dollar and the impact of comparative foreign currency translations in various geographies. Revenue in the US jumped 9% in 2016 as the company continued to see strong demand within the petrochemical and power industries. In Europe, revenues spiked 14% due to strong demand within the Eastern European and Russian regions.

  <p>
   As part of its growth strategy, Thermon intends to expand its sales and marketing efforts into international growth markets like Russia, China, and India, where the energy, chemical, and power generation sectors are expanding with economic and consumer demand. It will also use acquisitions and investments to complement its existing business lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to geographic expansion, other growth efforts include broadening its product and service lines to serve alternative energy companies that work in solar, carbon capture, and other areas.

  <p>
   Thermon also grows its portfolio through the use of acquisitions. In 2015 the company purchased Industrial Process Insulators, an insulation contractor serving the refining, petrochemical, power and energy, marine, and pulp and paper industries, for $22 million. The acquisition enhanced the company's ability to execute turnkey heat tracing products and services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2015, Thermon picked up Sumac Fabrication Co., a designer and fabricator of temporary power distribution equipment used in hazardous-location and general purpose areas within industrial facilities. The deal gave Thermon the ability to grow its portfolio on a global basis.
