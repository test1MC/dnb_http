   Toshiba, which traces its roots to the 19th century, has been one Japan's major manufacturers and worldwide brands for decades. It products include nuclear power plants, semiconductors, computers, appliances, industrial equipment, elevators and more. While consumers might be familiar with Toshiba products such as laptop PCs, the company generates most of its revenue from industrial offerings such as energy transmission and distribution systems, solar power technology, and systems for hydro and thermal power. Toshiba is one of the major makers of computer memory chips. About 60% of the company's revenue comes from its international customers.

  <p>
   Toshiba's Energy &amp; Infrastructure segment accounts for more than a third of revenue while Electronic Devices &amp; Community Solutions each account for about a quarter of revenue. The rest of Toshiba's sales are generated by the Lifestyle Products &amp; Services unit and its "other" category.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company handles most of its own manufacturing with plants in Japan (where most are located), Asia, North America, and Europe.

  <p>
   About 40% of Toshiba's revenue originates in Japan while Asia generates nearly 30%. North America and Europe team up to account for most of the rest of Toshiba's sales.

   Toshiba's revenue fell 7% in 2016 (ended March) to about ￥5.6 trillion from ￥6.1 trillion in 2015. The company's Energy &amp; Infrastructure and Community Solutions units posted higher sales, but the other units reported decreases. The company blamed significantly lower sales in the Lifestyle Products &amp; Services segment on redefined sales territories and other factors that were part of a restructuring.
  </p>
  <p>
   Toshiba reported a net loss of $460 billion yen for 2016, which was bigger than the $37 million loss of 2015. The company was beset by impairment charges, deferred taxes, and other expenses that deepened its loss year-to-year. The loss to led to cash outflow in 2016 compared to positive cash flow from operations in 2015.

   Toshiba was trying to recover from an accounting scandal that overstated revenue by billions when one of the causes of the scandal stuck again. Part of the overstatement came from Toshiba's nuclear energy operations in the US. In early 2017 the company reported more damage from losses from the nuclear operations and said that it would have to write off billions of dollars from those operations. That led the company to put part of its memory chip unit, one of its most valuable assets, up for sale to raise cash. It was estimated that the chip business could be worth as much as ￥2 trillion ($17 billion) if it were completely sold.
  </p>
  <p>
   In its other businesses, Toshiba reorganized them in 2016 to provide better focus and accountability from managers. Businesses that were restructured were PCs, Visual Products, Home Appliances, Discrete Semiconductors and System LSI. The company sold Toshiba Medical Systems as part of its drive to raise money to support operations.

   Geographically Toshiba is expanding its footprint in Southeast Asia. The company plans to invest $1 billion (US) in the region over six years. The goal is to double sales to $7 billion. Toshiba reached an agreement with

   and Optis concerning an optical disk drive plant that's a joint venture between Toshiba and Samsung. Toshiba will transferred its share of the plant ownership to OPTIS over three years.

  <p>
   With nearly 600 companies of one kind or another under its umbrella, Toshiba isn't shy adding adding more.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, it acquired OCZ Technology Group, a provider of high-performance solid state drives (SSDs) for computing devices and systems. The acquisition further expands Toshiba's solid-state storage capabilities. OCZ operate independently as a Toshiba subsidiary.

   The Toshiba subsidiary, Landis+Gyr, acquired GRIDiant Corp., a utility analytics company focused on the electric distribution grid. This transaction expands Landis+Gyr's software analytics portfolio.

  <p>
   Two Japanese electrical equipment manufacturers came together in 1939 to create Toshiba. Tanaka Seizo-sha, Japan's first telegraph equipment manufacturer, was founded in 1875 by Hisashige Tanaka, the so-called Edison of Japan. In the 1890s the company started making heavier electrical equipment such as transformers and electric motors, adopting the name Shibaura Seisakusho Works in 1893. Seisakusho went on to pioneer the production of hydroelectric generators (1894) and X-ray tubes (1915) in Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   The other half of Toshiba, Hakunetsusha &amp; Company, was founded by Ichisuke Fujioka and Shoichi Miyoshi as Japan's first incandescent lamp maker (1890). Renamed Tokyo Electric Company (1899), the company developed the coiled filament lightbulb (1921), Japan's first radio receiver and cathode-ray tube (1924), and the internally frosted glass lightbulb (1925). In 1939 it merged with Shibaura Seisakusho to form Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company (Toshiba).
