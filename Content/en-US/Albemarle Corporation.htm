   When it comes to chemistry, Albemarle does it all. The company develops, makes, and sells specialty chemicals for a range of markets, including automotive, construction, consumer electronics, crop protection, food safety, lubricants, pharmaceuticals, plastics, and refining. Its products include polymer additives (flame retardant chemicals, antioxidants to extend fuel storage life, and curatives that improve reaction time in coatings, adhesives, and elastomers), as well as catalysts, surface treatment products, and fine chemicals. Albemarle also offers fine chemistry services, which include custom manufacturing, R&amp;D, and scale-up for companies that are developing new products like drugs or agrichemicals.

   The company had three reportable segments in 2015: Performance Chemicals, Refining Solutions, and Chemetall Surface Treatment. The Performance Chemicals segment (its largest, and which offers more than 150 products to a variety of end markets) includes the Lithium, PCS and Bromine product. Refining consists of heavy oil upgrading and clean fuels technologies. The Chemetall Surface Treatment segment consists of the company's surface treatment products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 Performance Chemicals was split into two separate reportable segments -- Bromine Specialties, and Lithium and Advanced Materials (which include Lithium, Performance Catalyst Solutions, and Curatives).

  <p>
   Albemarle's revenues increased in 2015 after experiencing a continuous decline since 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net sales increased by 49% due  to the impact of the
   <company id="107135">
    Rockwood Holdings
   </company>
   acquisition. Excluding this, net sales decreased primarily due to unfavorable sales volumes, unfavorable impacts from currency translation and unfavorable price impacts due to market conditions and portfolio mix.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Albemarle's revenues net income increased by 151% as the result of increased sales and absence of loss from discontinued operations partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net cash provided by the operating activities decreased by $131.9 million compared to the previous year, primarily due to change in accrued expenses and income taxes payable.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 and 2014 Albemarle realigned its global business units. As a result of the Rockwood acquisition in 2015, Albemarle realigned its organizational structure under three reportable segments: Performance Chemicals, Refining Solutions, and Chemetall Surface Treatment.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash, in 2016 the company sold its Tribotecc metal sulfides business to
   <company id="130284">
    Treibacher Industrie
   </company>
   and its minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals businesses to Huber Engineered Materials, a division of
   <company id="40244">
    J.M. Huber
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   That year, it also sold its Chemetall Surface Treatment business for $3.2 billion to
   <company id="43760">
    BASF Corp
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In the last few years, Albemarle has also devoted significant resources to expand its global facilities and to make acquisitions and form joint ventures, which together are improving its production capacity and beefing up its portfolio of products. Sales of Performance Chemicals in Asia are expected to grow long-term due to the underlying growth in consumer demand and the shift of the production of consumer electronics from the US and Europe to Asia. In response, Albemarle has set up a sales and marketing network in China, Japan, Korea, and Singapore to sell products sourced from the US, Europe, China, and the Middle East.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company announced plans to enter the market with commercial quantities of GreenCrest, a polymeric fire safety solution based on technology licensed from Dow Global Technologies LLC, a subsidiary of
   <company id="10471">
    The Dow Chemical Company
   </company>
   , for use in expanded  and extruded  polystyrene foam applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it completed the installation of a granulation and blending system in Shanghai, increasing Albemarle's total one-pack capacity to over 10,000 metric tons/year, and added the capability to make one-pack formulations of up to eight components.
  </p>
  <p>
   Albemarle also raises cash by selling non-core businesses. In 2014 the company sold its antioxidant, ibuprofen, and propofol businesses and related assets to
   <company id="101127">
    SI Group, Inc
   </company>
   . The transaction include manufacturing sites in Orangeburg, South Carolina and Jinshan, China.  Certain applications and technical support capabilities located in Shanghai, China and Baton Rouge, Louisiana were also included in the transaction.
  </p>
  <p>
   Growing its R&amp;D investment, the company reported R&amp;D expenses of $102.8 million, $88.3 million, and $82.2 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In early 2017 the company acquired China-based Jiangxi Jiangli New Materials Science and Technology's lithium business for $145 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Albemarle acquired chemical giant Rockwood Holdings for $5.6 billion. Rockwood was a leading integrated and low cost global producer of lithium and lithium compounds used in lithium ion batteries for electronic devices, transportation vehicles and future energy storage technologies. It was also one of the largest global producers of surface treatments and coatings for metal processing, serving the automotive, aerospace, and general industrial markets. This combination reflected both companies' commitment to drive sustainable growth, creating one of the world's premier specialty chemicals companies, with market-leading positions across four high-margin businesses: lithium, catalysts, bromine, and surface treatment.

  <p>
   In 2013 Albemarle expanded the kilo lab at its FDA-registered cGMP active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The kilo lab production unit will operate within South Haven's cGMP standards and will be suitable for production of API products. In 2013 Abemarle formed a joint venture with Senze Meilu Company, of Shanxi, China to build and operate a new 50,000 metric ton facility to manufacture MARTINAL fine precipitated alumina trihydrate flame retardants based on Albemarle's proprietary technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year, Jordan Bromine Company (Abemarle's joint venture in Jordan) launched a project to double its bromine production capacity
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Albemarle opened a new research and operations center at its catalyst manufacturing facilities in South Korea.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year, it also opened a shared services center in Dalian, China. Known as Albemarle's Asia-Pacific Center of Excellence (CoE), the Dalian site was developed as part of the company's strategy and complements the regional CoEs currently operating in Budapest, Hungary and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of a restructuring plan, the company has been divesting some of its underperforming assets. It decided to exit its phosphorous flame retardants business in 2012. Part of its Polymer Solutions segment, the business has manufacturing plants in the UK and China which will close. The company also sold its Teesport, UK, plant to Finland's Kemira Oyj. The Teesport facility produced emulsifiers and intermediates for the drilling fluids industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company formed the Albemarle Environmental Division to focus on expanding product and service offerings for the air pollution control industry through the development of multi-pollutant control technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company acquired Iowa-based Catilin, which expanded Albemarle's offerings in the biofuels market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Albemarle was incorporated in 1893.
