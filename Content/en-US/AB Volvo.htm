   Despite the fact that the name "Volvo" still conjures up visions of soccer moms, Volvo should really only inspire images of burly truck drivers. The company is one of the world's largest makers of trucks, buses, and construction equipment. In North America, the company makes big rigs through its

   brand in North America and

   in Europe. Other products include marine (Volvo Penta) and industrial engines.  Overall Volvo has production facilities in nearly 20 countries.

   Volvo's main business segments (Trucks, Construction Equipment, Buses, Financial Services, and Penta) sell their products and services in 190 markets worldwide. It has production facilities in nearly 20 countries. Europe accounts for 37% of sales. Other major markets include North America (27%), Asia (18%), South America (10%), and other markets (8%).

   Part of the company's response to continued economic uncertainty is building smaller, less expensive trucks, particularly under its Renault label. It positions them for developing markets but lower price appeals to all. Volvo is also working to meet strict EU environmental requirements for trucks, buses, construction equipment, and its Penta vehicles.
  </p>
  <p>
   Speaking of developing markets, Volvo positioned itself to take part in the world's largest economy when in 2013 it signed an agreement with China's
   <company id="140693">

   </company>
   to produce heavy-duty trucks. The Swedish company in 2015 obtained a 45% stake in Dongfeng Commercial Vehicles, a subsidiary of the Chinese firm, that will make big trucks for China and other countries.

   Swedish ball bearing maker

   formed Volvo (Latin for "I roll") as a subsidiary in 1915. Volvo began building cars in 1926, trucks in 1928, and bus chassis in 1932 in Gothenburg. Sweden's winters and icy roads made the company keenly attentive to engineering and safety. Volvo bought an engine maker in 1931. In 1935 Volvo became an independent company led by Assar Gabrielsson and Gustaf Larson.

   Sweden's neutrality during WWII allowed Volvo to grow and move into component manufacturing and tractor production. Output in 1949 exceeded 100,000 units, 80% of which were sold in Sweden. The purchase of Bolinder-Munktell (farm machinery, diesel engines; Sweden; 1950) enhanced Volvo's position in the Swedish tractor market. Volvo introduced turbocharged diesel truck engines and windshield defrosters and washers in the 1950s. By 1956 car production had outstripped truck and bus output.
