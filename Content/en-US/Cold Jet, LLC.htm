   Dry ice blasting sounds like a pseudo-sport any adolescent male could enthusiastically get behind, but for Cold Jet, it's serious business. The firm makes dry ice blasting equipment used in industrial cleaning applications. Dry ice blasting can remove ink, glue, oil, paint, mold, and rubber from industrial equipment. The company, which operates in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Canada, and Mexico, uses recycled carbon dioxide to eliminate the need for solvents or chemicals in the cleaning process. In addition to its cleaning products, Cold Jet makes dry ice production equipment sold worldwide. The company was established in 1986, in conjunction with the creation of its "Cryoblast" dry ice blast machine.
