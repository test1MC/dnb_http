  <p>
   A big increase in the sale of Computing, Consumer, and Industrial products drove IDT's revenue to $697 million in 2016, a 22% increase from 2015. Demand for interface and wireless charging products help fuel a 57% rise in Computing, Communications, and Industrial revenue. Communications sales slid 4% in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   The higher sales and a tax benefit to raise IDT's profit 107% to $195 million in 2016 from 2015. Cash from operations followed suit, rising to $192 million in 2016 from $172 million the year before.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   A group of engineers (most were
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   veterans) founded Integrated Device Technology (IDT) in 1980 to develop chips based on emerging CMOS technology. IDT initially targeted military and high-speed commercial markets. Its first product, a static random-access memory (SRAM) chip, was shipped in 1982. The company combined bipolar and CMOS technology in a process called BiCMOS in 1986 and debuted the first BiCMOS SRAM chip two years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1989 IDT entered the RISC microprocessor market when it licensed
   <company id="56804">
    MIPS Technologies
   </company>
   ' chip design. Six years later IDT formed Centaur Technology, a subsidiary that began developing the WinChip microprocessor based on
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   's industry-standard x86 architecture. IDT unveiled the WinChip in 1997. Two years after that, IDT restructured its manufacturing operations, closing or moving some facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 1999 IDT acquired rival Quality Semiconductor. However, faced with slipping sales and stiff price competition, the company sold Centaur, including its WinChip line of x86 microprocessors, to
   <company id="60278">
    VIA Technologies
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   To enhance its focus on communications chips, IDT reorganized its business in 2000 to group its high-growth networking products within a division. The focus on high-margin products, along with improved conditions across the semiconductor industry, returned IDT to profitability in 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the face of a dramatic downturn in the global chip industry, in 2001 the company laid off about 20% of its workforce. Also that year the company acquired Newave Semiconductor, a Shanghai-based maker of voice processing and transport chips. The following year it bought Solidum Systems, which made network processing devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   IDT acquired a portfolio of designs for content-addressable memory (CAM) chips from
   <company id="104903">
    IBM
   </company>
   in 2003. The following year the company bought privately held ZettaCom, which made switching and traffic management chips, for about $34 million in cash. The company formed a serial switching division, partly based on ZettaCom's operations and products and partly on a design team integrated into IDT under a technology licensing agreement with Internet Machines Corp.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 IDT made the biggest acquisition in its history, buying rival
   <company id="14351">
    Integrated Circuit Systems
   </company>
   (ICS) for about $1.7 billion in cash and stock, including assumed stock options. Following the acquisition, IDT reorganized into three product segments: Networking, Timing (later Timing and Memory Interface), and Standard Products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Just after the ICS acquisition closed, IDT acquired the timing solutions business of
   <company id="114089">
    Freescale Semiconductor
   </company>
   for $35 million. IDT became Freescale's preferred timing solutions provider under the deal, and the two chip makers agreed on a silicon foundry arrangement, under which Freescale continued to make the timing solutions product line for IDT. The former Freescale business supplied semiconductors for the computer server, networking, and storage markets, including clocks for communications processor-based systems and clock synthesizers for servers. The acquisition widened IDT's portfolio in clock chips, which was expanded through the ICS purchase.
  </p>
  <p>
   IDT moved into a new corporate headquarters in San Jose in 2005, after purchasing an existing facility on 20 acres of land. Employees previously housed in Salinas and Santa Clara were consolidated into the offices. San Jose became the headquarters of the merged company, which was initially owned about 54% by previous shareholders of IDT and 46% by former ICS shareholders.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 IDT relocated work from its semiconductor assembly and test plant in Manila to a facility in Penang, Malaysia, resulting in the closing of the plant in the Philippines. The Penang plant phased out its assembly work, outsourcing the chores to contractor Advanced Interconnect Technology (AIT). Penang continued to do semiconductor testing. IDT laid off about 300 employees at the Malaysian facility as a result of the assembly outsourcing. Also in 2006 IDT purchased the PC audio product line of
   <company id="100207">
    SigmaTel
   </company>
   for $80 million, including $72 million in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 IDT acquired video processing technology and related assets from
   <company id="107363">
    Silicon Optix
   </company>
   , including the Hollywood Quality Video (HQV) brand and the Reon product line. The Toronto-based HQV intellectual property and engineering teams transferred to IDT, as well. The company saw the acquired video technology complementing its PanelPort products for flat-panel displays.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2008 the company reorganized into five operating segments: Communications, Computing &amp; Multimedia, Enterprise Computing, Networking, and Video &amp; Display. Those segments were gathered into two reportable segments for financial results: Communications and Computing &amp; Consumer.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 IDT acquired
   <company id="57529">
    Tundra Semiconductor
   </company>
   after making an unsolicited offer for about $105 million in cash. The offer topped a competing bid from another Canadian chip maker,
   <company id="58128">
    Gennum
   </company>
   . Tundra terminated its merger agreement with Gennum and paid a breakup fee of about $4 million to Gennum as a result. IDT sees a good fit in buying Tundra Semi, adding interconnect semiconductor products for communications, computing, and embedded electronics. At about the same time, IDT sold the assets of its network search engine products to
   <company id="104906">
    NetLogic Microsystems
   </company>
   for $100 million in cash and bought sensor technology from
   <company id="132597">
    Leadis Technology
   </company>
   for around $6 million in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   IDT sold its Micro Networks subsidiary (microwave products and technology for military/aerospace applications) to
   <company id="14772">
    Spectrum Control
   </company>
   for about $13 million in 2009. The sale provided IDT with cash to expand faster by growing businesses in the communications, computer, and consumer electronics markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The global recession lessened sales of consumer electronics, a crucial market to IDT and many other chip makers. The semiconductor industry, always highly cyclical in nature, suffered through an extended downturn as a result, and the company's sales in fiscal 2010 reflected that reality, with revenues off by 19% from the prior year. IDT must continue turning out new products, or acquiring new technologies, to remain competitive with its industry peers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 IDT bought Mobius Microsystems, a maker of all-silicon crystal oscillators, for around $21 million in cash. The purchase expands IDT's size and market reach in timing and clock management products. That same year the company bought the assets of IKOR from iWatt for approximately $9 million in cash, expanding its power management products portfolio.
