   BeneFit Cosmetics will make you look lovely, and for a good cause. The company, which donates a portion of proceeds to charity, boasts products that have clever names and pin-up lasses. BeneFit sells its lines and offers facial services through more than 3,000 counters (called "Beauty Bars") in department stores and beauty specialty shops in nearly 40 countries worldwide. It also boasts more than a dozen dedicated boutiques located mostly in Eastern US. BeneFit Cosmetics, whose celebrity-endorsed Benetint product brought the fledgling company into the mainstream, was founded in 1976 in San Francisco by sisters Jean Ann and Jane Ann Ford as The Face Place. Glamour leviathan

   Thanks to the continued growth of flagship products They're Real! and POREfessional, BeneFit helped its parent's Perfumes and Cosmetics segment log 3% revenue growth in fiscal 2013 and organic revenue growth of 7%. Pumping up profits further was BeneFit's latest strong rollout: Fake Up moisturizing concealer.

  <p>
   The company relies on new product launches and international retail expansion. In 2013, the company opened stores in London, Dublin, and Madrid. The company rolls out new products as it continues to extend its reach into perfumes, as well. BeneFit also extended its retail presence to Russia, opening about 20 stores there. The moves are showing signs of paying off. Its products have helped BeneFit to log sales increases for LVMH, which considers BeneFit to be a rapidly growing American brand and a profitable business.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its 2014 strategy, BeneFit is adding Paris to its US, Asia, and UK expansion plans. The beauty firm sells its products in France through retailer

   and online through that brand's e-commerce site.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also partners with others, such as

   </company>
   , to create accessories perfect for the BeneFit customer. Through an alliance with the consumer products company, BeneFit in 2014 will begin offering a line of makeup bags, travel bags, and handbags.
