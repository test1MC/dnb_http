   <em>
    Glanbia
   </em>
   translates from Gaelic into "pure food" but Glanbia plc is largely about one food group -- dairy products. The company is the largest dairy-product operation in Ireland and a significant cheese supplier to Europe, the UK, and the US. Its ingredients and nutritional operations offer food and beverage manufacturers with cheese, butter, casein, whey proteins, premixes, and nutritional ingredients. Glanbia's retail consumer products include Avonmore and Snowcream branded fresh and cultured dairy products; it also holds the license for the

   yogurt brand in Ireland. It serves the agricultural market with its animal feed and grain milling businesses, and also has significant joint venture operations.

  <p>
   The company was founded in 1997 from the acquisition of dairy cooperative, Waterford, by Avonmore, a food products company. Then called Avonmore Waterford Group, the new company almost immediately began cutting jobs and closing plants in Ireland and the UK. In 1999 Avonmore Waterford changed its name to Glanbia. That year the company sold its UK milk operations to

    Express Dairies

   for £100 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Glanbia allied with US-based

   in 2000 to extend its reach in the European pizza cheese market, where it already had strong market share. The deal gave Leprino a 49% share in Glanbia Cheese Limited and allowed Glanbia to use Leprino's patented cheese production technology. Also in 2000 Glanbia won a five-year contract to supply 2,500

  <p>
   Market overcapacity challenged the company's meats business, and in 2002 it closed its UK processed meats unit. However, after a 2002 fire at one fresh pork processing plant, Glanbia invested heavily and expanded its capacity. When competitor
   <company id="135790">
    Dairygold
   </company>
   quit its pig slaughtering business in 2004, Glanbia was ready to pick up the extra business.
  </p>
  <p>
   To expand its nutritionals division, in 2004 Glanbia purchased Germany's Kortus Food Ingredients Services. Described as a provider of "customized nutrient delivery systems," Kortus develops infant formula and specialty dietary products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Glanbia bought the CMP branded fluid milk, cream, and juice businesses from
   <company id="135790">
    Dairygold Co-operative
   </company>
   for about $13 million in 2005. That year it also acquired Pro-Fibe Nutrition, a sports nutrition company located in the UK and Zymalact Mexico, a dairy-blending and processed cheese company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Glanbia sold its 25% interest in The Cheese Company Holdings Limited (TCCH) to majority owner, Milk Link, for about €47 million (approximately $93 million). It increased its presence in North America and the omega-3 market that year with the acquisition of Canadian nutritionals company, Pizzey's Milling. Pizzey's mills flaxseeds and fish oils for omega-3s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Glanbia got out of the meat business in 2008 when it sold its pork operations for €35 million (about $46 million) in a management buyout. The company also entered the nutritional supplement sector in 2008 with the purchase of the US's Optimum, for which it paid €281 million ($323 million). Optimum manufactures supplements for the sports nutrition sector.
