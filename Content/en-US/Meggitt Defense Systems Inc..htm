   The company's thermal management systems address the growing need for lightweight and durable equipment to cool computer processors, which can be negatively affected by the heat they expel, as well as the heat generated by vehicles. Meggitt Defense's Auxiliary Cooling and Power Units (ACPU) are designed to reduce the dependence on vehicle engine power and cooling by more than 40%. The company has contracts with
