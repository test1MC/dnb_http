   The manufacturer sells its products primarily through big-box retailers the likes of Costco and Wal-Mart and through more than a handful of factory stores located in the company's home state of Utah. Operated under the Lifetime Stores banner, the outlets carry both new and blemished products and boast the manufacturer's full line of Backyard Adventure playsets. Through the stores, the company also rents its branded tables and chairs for residential and corporate events.

  <p>
   The past global economic downturn benefited the manufacturer's bottom line as more consumers took up cooking meals at home and gardening due to budget constraints. Lifetime Products has been catering to this crowd in recent years by launching an assortment of home and garden items. One such rollout is its Lifetime Convertible Bench, which transforms from a bench into a picnic table for two, as well as the Lifetime Raised Garden Kit, which features connecting walls that are four feet long for creating raised garden beds.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lifetime Products also adds to its store count. In 2012 it added a 9,300-sq.-ft. store in St. George, Utah.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the leader in HDPE, Lifetime Products works to protect its patents. In 2013 the company took action to enforce its patent rights in China against Shaoxing Hongye Leisure Product Co., Ltd., which was allegedly manufacturing tables and chairs that incorporate features that are covered by one or more of Lifetime's Chinese patents. The patent at issue has been upheld by the Chinese Patent and Trademark Office.

  <p>
   The company continues to expand its water sports line with the 2011 acquisition of Pennsylvania-based Emotion Kayaks. The move allows Lifetime Products to further boost its sporting goods line while the outdoor recreational market has remained healthy despite US economic woes. The company entered the kayak business in 2010, when it bought the assets of California-based Dragonfly Innovation Corp.
