   Candy spends all day -- every day -- cooking food, cleaning carpets, doing laundry, and washing the dishes without complaint. The company makes and markets thousands of models of major appliances, including washing machines, washer dryers, dishwashers, refrigerators, freezers, ovens, and vacuums. Its brands include namesake Candy, Hoover, Rosières, Iberna, Hoover Grepa, Jinling, Hoover Helkama, Vyatka, and Zerowatt. The firm has grown through acquisitions, including its purchase of Hoover European Appliance Group. More than half of its revenue comes from sales of washing and flooring appliances. The founding Fumagalli family still owns and runs the company, which made its first household appliance around 1945.

   After seeing an American washing machine, Enzo Fumagalli (he noticed the American machine while a prisoner in the US during WWII) returned to Italy with the inspiration to make washing machines for the local market. Fumagalli and his family, which already manufactured precision machine instruments for the food industry, started making washing machines around 1945; Candy Model 50 was their first product. The family founded Candy Elettrodomestici that year, manufacturing about 30 machines a month.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1959 the company expanded to France, and by 1961 Candy had more than 1,200 employees and produced hundreds of thousands of washing machines a year. In 1970 the company acquired some operations of refrigerator maker Kelvinator and cooking appliance maker La Sorvana.

  <p>
   In 1980 Candy bought Kelvinator UK -- the purchase gave the company its first foreign manufacturing outlet. Later in the 1980s Candy acquired Italian laundry equipment maker Zerowatt, cooking equipment maker Gasfire, and French upscale oven maker Rosieres. In 1992 Candy bought Spain's washing machine manufacturer Mayc (Otsein), and a year later Candy purchased refrigerator maker Iberna.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 Candy grew about 50% through the purchase of the Hoover European Appliances Group, which included the Hoover vacuum cleaner operations and brand for Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Candy built a plant in Podborany, Czech Republic, to assemble household refrigerators and freezers; the plant has the capacity to produce 800,000 appliances per year.
