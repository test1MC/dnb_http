   Universal Display thinks the world should be flat and lit with its organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials. With its own research and through sponsored research agreements with

   <company id="40494">

   , the company develops OLED technologies and materials for screens from cell phones to large flat panel displays and solid-state lighting. Based in the US, it has facilities around the world.

  <p>
   The company has subsidiaries Ireland, Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong. The Hong Kong subsidiary operates a chemistry laboratory to support greater research and development initiatives. In 2014, materials brought in 67% of Universal Displays revenue, a 33% increase from 2013 with the rest of revenue coming from royalty and licensing fees.

   Almost 99% of Universal Display's revenue comes from customers in Asia. Customers in South Korea account for 74% of the Universal Display's revenue with Japan (24%), Taiwan, and the US making up the rest. The company has offices in the US, Hong Kong, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.

   The company targets flat panel display manufacturers and makers of lighting products to license its technologies and buy its materials. Universal Display supplies manufacturers with materials in development to see how they might work in a product. It works with manufacturers to develop displays and lighting products using phosphorescent OLEDs, which use much less power than OLEDs. Contracts with the

  <p>
   As LED displays have taken market share from those made with LCDs, OLED display sales have increased and that's reflected in Universal Display's financial performance. Its revenue jumped to $191 million in 2014, increasing 38% from 2013. Net income, however, contracted 43% in 2014 to $41.85 million. While sales of materials rose 33% and royalty and licensing fees increased 34%, 2014 revenue also included a $50 million in licensing and royalties from Samsung Display. Net income was affected by higher material costs, tax settlements in Japan, and higher bonus and stock compensation related to the firm's research and development. Cash flow from operations was $47.2 million in 2014, compared to $45 million in 2013.

  <p>
   Developing materials and uses for OLEDs is the key to Universal Display. The company spent $41 million on research and development in 2014, which was about the same as its net income. Besides conducting in-house R&amp;D, it works with university researchers, the US government, and its customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   A critical element for Universal Display is to get its materials and technology into new products through sales and licensing agreements.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company entered into two agreements with LG Display for OLED technology. A patent license agreement grants LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the company's patent portfolio. Also in 2015, Universal Display and Sumitomo Chemical Company signed a new OLED licensing agreement that gives non-exclusive license rights to make and sell solution-processed OLEDs.

  <p>
   For one of its newer areas, phosphorescent LEDs, Universal Display expanded an agreement with
   <company id="152501">
    BOE Technology Group
   </company>
   to collaborate on evaluating and developing displays using the material.
