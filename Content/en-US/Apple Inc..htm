   Ask Siri to name the most successful company in the world and it might respond: Apple. In terms of profit, revenue, market capitalization, and consumer cachet, it certainly ranks right up there. The iPhone, in its ninth year and seventh generation, has been the company's golden goose, although the aging product may be losing a little of its luster. In addition to the iPhone, other familiar Apple products and services include MacBook computers and iPad tablets, as well as iTunes, the App store, and Apple Music. Primarily a consumer-oriented company, Apple has inked alliances with
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   and
   <company id="13494">
    Cisco Systems
   </company>
   to deepen its penetration of the enterprise market. About 60% of revenue comes from outside the Americas.

        <p>
   Apple's mobile phone, the iPhone, accounts for nearly two-thirds of sales, with its tablet, the iPad, generating another 10%. Its Mac computer lineup (including the iMac desktop of the MacBook laptop) and service offerings (including the iTunes Store, iCloud, and Apple Pay mobile payment) each contribute another 10% of revenue. Other products -- such as the Apple Watch and Apple TV -- are responsible for the remainder.
  </p>
        <p>
   Apple's products run on two operating systems. The mobile products are on iOS, now in its 10th generation, and the computers run on OS X. The company generally updates its operating systems once a year.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company makes some of its products at facilities in Ireland and the US, but most manufacturing is handled by third party contractors, such as
   <company id="58638">
    Hon Hai Precision Industry
   </company>
   , also known as FoxConn, operating in Asia.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The Americas market, which includes the US, accounts for 40% of Apple's sales. Greater China and Europe each contribute about a quarter of revenue.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company has nearly 500 Apple retail stores across the US, as well as in some 20 other countries; China and Canada are the largest retail store markets outside the US.

   Apple sells its products through its own retail stores and website, as well as through a direct sales force. In addition, the company distributes through indirect channels, such as third-party retailers, resellers, and cellular network carriers such as
   <company id="10197">
    Verizon
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10103">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="103483">
    Sprint
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="59771">
    T-Mobile
   </company>
   . Indirect channels account for some 75% of Apple's total revenue.

   Apple had been on a remarkable run of increasing revenue and profit for the past decade or so, but it saw declines in both measures in fiscal 2016 (ended September). The company reported revenue that year of $215.6 billion, down 8% from the prior year. Its three top product lines (iPhone, iPad, and Mac) all decreased, but the company was particularly hit by an 8% drop in unit sales of the iPhone and a 12% drop in iPhone net sales. The results come amid a slowdown in the smartphone market in general (especially in China, which had been Apple's largest growth market) and a decline in interest in the iPhone particularly as customers wait for a more substantial redesign (possibly late in 2017 for the iPhone's 10th anniversary).
  </p>
        <p>
   Net income was also down in fiscal 2016, falling nearly 15% to $46 billion, as a result of the reduced revenue, as well as Apple's continued investments in research and development. The company spent $10 billion in R&amp;D that year, compared to some $8 billion in 2015 and $6 billion in 2014.

   Following its customary practice, Apple introduced the latest model iPhones toward the end of its fourth quarter, priming them to benefit from holiday sales in what is the first quarter of its fiscal year. Sales of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus buoyed the company's revenue and profit at the end of the calendar year. The always active Apple observer community is already looking forward to the next version of the iPhone in 2017, the 10th anniversary of the breakthrough product. The trick for Apple is to produce a combination of hardware and software that matches, if not surpasses, the imagination of its customers.
  </p>
        <p>
   In recent releases other companies, notably Samsung, have caught up to (and in some features, surpassed) Apple's technologies and design. Apple has disappointed some analysts by failing to deliver a new breakthrough product. (Although
   <company id="55277">
    Samsung
   </company>
   ran into problems of its own with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phone.) The Apple Watch has failed to produce blockbuster sales, though Apple has said sales are in line with expectations, and services like Apple Pay and Apple Music have not provided noticeable boosts to revenue. What's more, a new version of the MacBook Pro laptop computer introduced in late 2016 didn't provoke sizzling sales.
  </p>
        <p>
   While China provided a big injection of revenue in 2015, sales there dropped 17% in 2016 in the face of stiffening competition. Apple has made investments in China, including in the country's dominant ride-share company, to cultivate the market. Apple executives have wooed officials in India in hopes that it can break into that enticing market. In 2016 Apple opened an office in Hyderabad that will focus on development of Maps for Apple products.
  </p>
        <p>
   In an effort to reach the business market, Apple has developed partnerships with several big companies. Apple has worked with
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="91277">
    SAP
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="13494">
    Cisco Systems
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="155640">
    Deloitte
   </company>
   to develop business applications for Apple products. Demand from the enterprise market has bubbled up, somewhat, from employees wanting to use at work the Apple products they use at home. IBM has even embraced Apple products such at the Macbook Pro for its own workforce.
  </p>
        <p>
   In some ways Apple's strengths can be seen as weaknesses. The tight interlocking of software and hardware helps its devices work, but it frustrates users who would like to have access to more third party products including hardware. The company's history of innovation has led analysts and customers to expect big products from Apple on a regular basis. They're disappointed when it fails to deliver.
  </p>
        <p>
   Apple became ensnarled in debates over national security and privacy in 2016 when it refused to help the FBI get access to information on a terrorist's iPhone. The issue was resolved when authorities got the information without Apple's help. In another regulatory battle, the European Union officials ruled that Apple owed some $14 billion in back taxes to Ireland. Apple said it would fight the ruling, but the issue is indicative of Europe's stronger stance against American technology companies.

   College dropouts Steve Jobs (1955-2011) and Steve Wozniak founded Apple in 1976 in California's Santa Clara Valley. After Jobs' first sales call brought an order for 50 units, the duo built the Apple I in his garage and sold it without a monitor, keyboard, or casing. Demand convinced Jobs there was a distinct market for small computers, and the company's name (a reference to Jobs' stint on an Oregon farm) and the computer's user-friendly look and feel set it apart from others.
  </p>
        <p>
   By 1977 Wozniak added a keyboard, color monitor, and eight peripheral device slots (which gave the machine considerable versatility and inspired numerous third-party add-on devices and software). Sales jumped from $7.8 million in 1978 to $117 million in 1980, the year Apple went public. In 1983 Wozniak left the firm and Jobs hired
   <company id="11166">
    PepsiCo
   </company>
   's John Sculley as president. Apple rebounded from failed product introductions that year by unveiling the Macintosh in 1984. After tumultuous struggles with Sculley, Jobs left in 1985 and founded NeXT, a designer of applications for developing software. That year Sculley ignored
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   founder Bill Gates' appeal for Apple to license its products and make the Microsoft platform an industry standard.
  </p>
        <p>
   Apple blazed the desktop publishing trail in 1986 with its Mac Plus and LaserWriter printers. The following year it formed the software firm that later became Claris (and ultimately
   <company id="43063">
    FileMaker
   </company>
   ). The late 1980s brought new competition from Microsoft, whose Windows operating system (OS) featured a graphical interface akin to Apple's. Apple sued but lost its claim to copyright protection in 1992.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1993 Apple unveiled the Newton handheld computer, but sales were slow. Earnings fell drastically, so the company trimmed its workforce. (Sculley was among the departed.) In 1994 Apple cried "uncle" and began licensing clones of its OS, hoping a flurry of cheaper Mac-alikes would encourage software developers. By 1996 struggling Apple realized Mac clones were stealing sales. That year it hired Gilbert Amelio, formerly of
   <company id="11058">
    National Semiconductor
   </company>
   , as CEO.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company bought NeXT in 1997, but sales kept dropping and it subsequently cut about 30% of its workforce, canceled projects, and trimmed research costs. Meanwhile Apple's board ousted Amelio and Jobs took the position back on an interim basis. The CEO forged a surprising alliance with Microsoft, which included releasing a Mac version of Microsoft's popular office software. To protect market share, Jobs also stripped the cloning license from chief imitator
   <company id="42868">
    Power Computing
   </company>
   and put it out of business.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1998 Apple jumped back into the race with its colorful cocktail of iMacs, and its first server software, the Mac OS X. That year the company also revamped its profitable Claris unit (by cutting 300 employees, shifting most operations to Apple, and renaming it FileMaker) and stopped making its Newton handheld device and printer products.
  </p>
        <p>
   Apple in 1999 opened a new chapter in portable computing with the introduction of its iBook laptop and (taking a cue from
   <company id="13193">
    Dell
   </company>
   ) began selling built-to-order systems online. In 2000, after two and a half years as the semipermanent executive in charge, Jobs took the "interim" out of his title, and revamped the company's Web site around a suite of consumer Internet services. Jobs unveiled overhauled desktop lines later that year, including an eight-inch cube-shaped G4. The company ended 2000 on a sour note, as an industrywide slowdown and poor response to the G4 cube resulted in Apple's first unprofitable quarter in years.
  </p>
        <p>
   Apple opened 2001 with another round of product upgrades, including faster processors, components such as CD and DVD burners, and an ultraslim version of its PowerBook, called Titanium. The company also made a move to reclaim some of its slipping share in the education market, purchasing software maker PowerSchool. Soon Apple confirmed a long-rumored plan to open a chain of retail stores in the US. The company then acquired DVD authoring software maker Spruce Technologies. In line with its strategy to market Macs as "digital hubs" for devices such as cameras and other peripherals, Apple closed the year with the introduction of a digital music player called the iPod.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2002 Apple introduced a new look for its iMac line; featuring a half-dome base and a flat-panel display supported by a pivoting arm, the redesign was the first departure from the original (and, at the time, radical) all-in-one design since iMac's debut in 1998. Looking to reclaim market share in the education sector, Apple then introduced the eMac -- a computer similar to the iMac to be sold only to students and educators (Apple later introduced a retail version). It continued its product push that year with the announcement that it would begin offering a rack-mount server called Xserve. In 2004, Apple debuted a streamlined iMac design powered by its G5 processor.
  </p>
        <p>
   Apple announced it would begin incorporating
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   processors into its PC lines in 2005, ending more than a decade of using PowerPC microprocessors; the transition was completed the following year. Also that year, Apple, Motorola, and Cingular Wireless (now
   <company id="102492">
    AT&amp;T Mobility
   </company>
   ) announced the debut of a mobile phone with iTunes functionality. Apple also unveiled the iPod nano, an updated (and even smaller) version of its miniature iPod model, as well as an iPod capable of playing video. In 2006 Apple reached a settlement in a dispute with
   <company id="42766">
    Creative Technology
   </company>
   over technology used in digital music players; Apple agreed to pay the company $100 million in exchange for a license to use Creative's patent related to navigation and organization.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company also launched an online movie service in 2006, and previewed a device called iTV for watching downloaded content on televisions. (Apple announced availability of its television device, redubbed Apple TV, early the following year. )
  </p>
        <p>
   Apple unveiled a mobile phone offering called the iPhone in 2007. To reflect the growing breadth of its product portfolio, the company announced it would change its name from Apple Computer to simply Apple. The company kicked off 2008 with the release of an updated Apple TV device in conjunction with an iTunes movie rental service.
  </p>
        <p>
   Looking toward the continued development of its mobile devices, Apple purchased P.A. Semi, a developer of low-power processors, in 2008. In another move intended to bring more of its chip design in-house, Apple bought
   <company id="103908">
    Intrinsity
   </company>
   , a provider of chip design software, in 2010.
  </p>
        <p>
   After beginning 2011 with a leave of absence and then stepping down as CEO, Steve Jobs died on October 5, 2011. COO Tim Cook had been named CEO after Jobs' resignation, though Jobs retained the chairman title until his death.
