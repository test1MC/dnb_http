  <p>
   Remington has seen an uptick in gun sales since US President Barack Obama took office in 2009. Along with other gun makers, the company has sold more guns and ammo as consumers are driven by concerns that the Obama Administration will tighten gun laws.
  </p>
  <p>
   Product innovation is also a key part of its growth strategy. In 2014 Remington launched New Model R51 9MM+P SUBCOMPACT, a concealed carry handgun. It also introduced Model 700 Ultimate Muzzleloader to the market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 it invested $32 million to expand its Remington ammunition plant in Lonoke, Arkansas.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it partnered with TrackingPoint, Inc. to make Precision Guided Firearm systems.

  <p>
   In 2011, Remington shuttered Marlin's manufacturing operations in Connecticut and moved production to existing Remington plants in New York and Kentucky as parent Freedom Group looked to cut costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a joining of two venerable companies founded in the 19th century, Remington purchased
   <company id="54359">
    Marlin Firearms
   </company>
   in 2008. The deal included Marlin's 100% interest in H&amp;R 1871 and added Marlin's shoulder-arm long gun and lever-action rifle products to Remington's offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was founded in 1816 by Eliphalet Remington II, who took his first orders upon winning second place in a shooting contest with a gun he built.
