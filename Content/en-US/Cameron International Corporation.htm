  <p>
   Net revenues increased for four years before declining in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, net revenue decreased by 15%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Subsea revenues dropped by 10%, due to weak new project orders and as a result of completion of a large subsea project offshore West Africa and lower activity levels on a Canada offshore subsea project.
  </p>
  <p>
   Surface revenues decreased by 19% as the result of lower volumes resulting from declining market fundamentals in North America and weak pricing. In addition, lower shipments for North Sea projects also contributed to decrease in revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cameron's drilling revenues declined by 11%. Service revenues declined driven by material decreases in offshore and onshore drilling activity levels and revenues from new equipment decreased largely due to a lower project backlog.
  </p>
  <p>
   Valves &amp; Measurement revenues decreased by 27% due to weaker demand for products sold into the upstream drilling and production market segments down in North America driven by a major distributor which significantly reduced its inventory levels in response to market weakness in North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, sales of Measurement products were down due to lower project activity for midstream products sold in international markets. Services revenues declined due to lower activity in the Asia Pacific region.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Cameron's net income decreased by 38% due to lower net revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash flow decreased by 41%.

   In 2015 the company sold its Reciprocating Compression business to
   <company id="10785">
    Ingersoll Rand
   </company>
   for $850 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Cameron announced the execution of definitive agreements between OneSubsea,
   <company id="52283">
    Helix Energy Solutions
   </company>
   , and Schlumberger for a non-incorporated alliance formed to develop technologies and to deliver equipment and services designed to provide customers with more cost effective and more efficient subsea well intervention solutions, particularly for deep and ultra-deepwater basins and high well pressure environments. Subsequently, Schlumberger made a bid to acquire Cameron in a deal valued at $14.8 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cameron pursues a strategy of growth through joint ventures and the acquisition of companies that complement its existing core businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   North America continues to be important to Cameron, accounting for nearly 38% of Cameron's revenues in 2015. Production and service facilities in North and South America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East and West Africa provide the Company with the ability to serve the global marketplace.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company continued to focus on new technology development in areas such as life of field services, processing, controls, optimization and high pressure and high temperature applications and in the integration of subsea and subsurface technologies to increase recovery and lower intervention costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company was rationalizing its business portfolio and sharpening its focus on the business segments that target the oil and gas equipment markets: markets that will be core to Cameron's future growth and that will provide synergies, share common processes, customers, technologies, as well as provide aftermarket services and growth opportunities.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2013 Cameron and Schlumberger formed OneSubsea (60% owned by Cameron International) to manufacture and develop products, systems, and services for the subsea oil and gas market. The creation of OneSubsea allows the company to bring together Schlumberger's expertise in subsea processing and platform integration with its own capabilities in subsea equipment to allow customers to greatly increase their subsea reservoir recovery rates. (In 2014 OneSubsea, Helix Energy Solutions, and Schlumberger formed an alliance to develop technologies and deliver services to optimize the cost and efficiency of subsea well intervention systems.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Cameron moved into the lucrative shale market in the US Northeast in 2011 through the acquisition of West Virginia-based Industrial Machine &amp; Fabrication, a leading aftermarket service provider for reciprocating engines and compressors.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it also expanded its drilling equipment portfolio, buying LeTourneau Technologies Drillings Systems and Offshore Products divisions from Joy Global for $375 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 a
   <company id="58872">
    BP
   </company>
   rig in the Gulf of Mexico exploded and sank, spewing oil into the Gulf. The blowout preventer on the system, made by Cameron International, failed to work properly. A board of inquiry was set up to find out the cause of the disaster, and a separate government report found that the company's blowout preventer proved incapable of stopping the high-pressure flow from the doomed well. The company claimed that its equipment met industry standards, and it was not found liable in any legal proceeding, although it did pay $82.5 million to settle with BP. (BP accounted for 12% of the company's revenues in 2010).
  </p>
  <p>
   Cameron traces its roots to the mid-1800s when it made steam engines to generate power for plants and textile and rolling mills.
