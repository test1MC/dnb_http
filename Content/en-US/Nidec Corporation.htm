   You won't find Nidec throwing down the latest dance steps, though the company specializes in spins and moves. The company claims the largest global market share for the tiny spindle motors that power hard-disk drives. It also makes midsized motors for home electronics and industrial equipment, along with small precision fans, power supplies, and pivot assemblies. Nidec's brushless DC motors can be found in automobiles (power steering units) and home appliances (air conditioners and refrigerators). About 75% of its sales are to customers outside Japan. Nidec was founded in 1973 by Shigenobu Nagamori and three other engineers as Nippon Densan Corporation.

  <p>
   Nidec's corporate headquarters is located at Kyoto, Japan. It has 232 subsidiaries located in 32 countries and five affiliated companies located in three countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Japan and China are the company's largest markets, representing 26% and 23% of net sales, respectively. Other major markets include the US (17%), Thailand (9%), Singapore (7%), and the Philippines (3%).

  <p>
   Nidec's revenues increased 18% from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to additional sales from newly consolidated subsidiaries and the depreciation of the Japanese yen against the US dollar. Its net income also spiked 35% during that same time period due to the increased revenue, foreign change gains, and decreased interest expenses. (Note: growth rates may differ after conversion to the US dollar.)

   By leveraging the plentiful and cheap labor markets of East Asia and establishing relationships with blue-chip clients in the US that include

   and

   and Asian stalwarts such as
   <company id="41866">
    Hitachi
   </company>
   , Nidec has nurtured what was a non-existent market in the 1970s into a critical supplier to the computer hardware and consumer electronics industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nidec has pursued an aggressive strategy of acquisitions and joint ventures. It is now using that method (as well as organic growth) to expand its home appliance and commercial/industrial motor business. As such, in 2015 the company purchased Motortecnica s.r.l., a privately owned Italian appliance, commercial, and industrial business. Through the purchase, Nidec strengthened its position in the global generators market.

  <p>
   A top engineer at tape deck manufacturer TEAC and machine tool maker Yamashina Siki in the early 1970s, Shigenobu Nagamori had developed a reputation as a brilliant engineer, but also as a young gun who was resistant to conformity and too indulged in personal challenges. Nagamori wasted no time in fulfilling his childhood dream of owning his own business. He lured away three engineers to start Nippon Densan Corporation (Nidec) out of his own home in 1973 when he was 29.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nagamori knew he would have trouble selling his motors in Japan without an established reputation. (Most small businesses in Japan are founded with the acceptance that they will never grow beyond the role of subcontractor to one of the country's giant corporations.) But inspired by ancient Japanese traditions of self-determination and individualism, Nagamori decided to bypass the modern power structure and pitch his products overseas in the US. He arrived unannounced at 3M with a suitcase full of tiny motors. Despite his nervous presentation, 3M was impressed with the quality of Nidec motors and placed a small order.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1976 Nagamori established Nidec America Corporation to foster growing business in the US. The initial contract with 3M had ballooned into regular orders for thousands of motors, which 3M used in its high-speed cassette duplicators.
  </p>
  <p>
   Still unable to secure a business loan in Japan, Nidec's staff took voluntary pay cuts to stay in business. (3M later offered a letter of credit on Nidec's behalf, forcing Japanese banks to reconsider.) Nagamori struggled to retain employees, who sought stability that only established companies such as
   <company id="41876">
    NEC
   </company>
   or
   <company id="41866">
    Hitachi
   </company>
   could provide. But Nagamori constantly improved his motors, which opened doors into new markets (computer disk drives) and kept the business alive.
