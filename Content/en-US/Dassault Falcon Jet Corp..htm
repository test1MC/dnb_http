   Dassault Falcon Jet and its parent hope to keep sales ascending in coming years by designing and developing new business jets. The company's newer models include the mid-sized Falcon 2000S and the eco-friendly Falcon 2000LX, which has a maximum range of 4,800 nautical miles and is lighter and more fuel-efficient than some competitors' jets. Other new models include the Falcon 900 EASy Series and the Falcon 900DX.

In addition, Dassault Falcon Jet opened a service center at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport in 2013. The new location allows the company to expand its maintenance operations in Moscow, an important hub for serving Russian-based and temporary executive aircraft. The service center serves Falcon 7X and Falcon 900 EASy Series aircraft.
