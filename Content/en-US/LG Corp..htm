   LG Corp. is a major South Korean chaebol (family-run industrial group) that maintains core businesses in electronics, telecommunications, and chemicals. Also known as LG Group, it operates through more than 45 wholly-owned, majority-owned, and minority-interest subsidiaries and affiliated companies in Korea and around the world. The most well-known are probably
   <company id="55961">
    LG Electronics
   </company>
   and
   <company id="104934">
    LG Chem
   </company>
   ; LG Corp. holds about a one-third ownership stake in each. LG Electronics, which makes TVs, smartphones, and home appliances, accounts for more than half of LG Corp's. total sales. The company was founded in 1947 and 12 years later produced Korea's first radio.

   Today, LG Electronics contributes substantially to LG Corp.'s overall business performance, posting more than $53 billion in revenue on sales of core products, such as smartphones, air conditioners, and home appliances. LCD panel manufacturer
   <company id="132810">
    LG Display
   </company>
   is also helping its parent produce solid performance results.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to its better-known consumer products, the group's chemicals segment is a top maker of LCD polarizers, and it maintains a strong reputation for producing state-of-the-art batteries among global IT and automotive companies. In 2010, for instance, LG Chem broke ground on an electric vehicle battery manufacturing plant in Michigan. Once completed in 2013, the factory will supply power packs for some 600,000 electric vehicles or 200,000 hybrid vehicles per year, and it is expected to create more than 500 jobs. The factory already has orders to fill from major carmakers, including a deal with
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   to supply batteries for the Chevrolet Volt electric car.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, its telecommunications segment reorganized and simplified operations by combining three of its telecom affiliates (LG TeleCom,
   <company id="116864">
    LG Dacom
   </company>
   , and LG Powercom) into a single entity called LG U+ in 2010. The purpose behind merging these businesses is to create a more unified base for developing and providing cable and wireless telecom products and services geared at both businesses and consumers.

  <p>
   LG Corp., named after founding companies Lucky and Goldstar, came into existence as a holding company in 2003. It was the first Korean corporation to introduce a holding company structure, in which investments and business divisions are separated.

  <p>
   During WWII Koo In-Hwoi made tooth powder for Koreans to use in place of salt, then the common dentifrice. Koo founded the Lucky Chemical Company in 1947 to make facial creams and, later, detergent, shampoo, and Lucky Toothpaste. The enterprise soon became Korea's only plastics maker. Koo established a trading company in 1953.
  </p>
  <p>
   Emulating Japanese exporters, Koo formed Goldstar Company in 1958 to make fans. The company became the first company in South Korea to make radios (1959), refrigerators (1965), TVs (1966), elevators and escalators (1968), and washing machines and air conditioners (1969). In 1967 Lucky collaborated with Caltex to build the Honam Oil Refinery, the first privately owned refinery in Korea. Both Lucky and Goldstar benefited from the
   <i>
    chaebol
   </i>
   's cozy relationship with President Park Chung Hee's government (1962-79) and used plentiful loans from Korean banks to diversify into everything from energy and semiconductors to insurance. Lucky began petrochemical production in 1977 and later built the world's largest single-unit petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia (1986).
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1970s and 1980s, Goldstar expanded rapidly as it took advantage of cheap Korean labor to export private-label electronics items to its large retail customers abroad. In the late 1970s the group began investing heavily in semiconductor production, in part to fulfill its own chip requirements. Goldstar companies teamed with more technically accomplished partners, including
   <company id="10103">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41876">
    NEC
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41866">
    Hitachi
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41843">
    Siemens
   </company>
   , and set out to capture office-automation and higher-end consumer electronics markets with Goldstar-brand goods.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1983 the
   <i>
    chaebol
   </i>
   became Lucky Goldstar.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although electronics sales grew rapidly, Lucky Goldstar's inefficient organizational structure slowed progress, and in 1984 archrival Samsung finally outdid it. In the late 1980s Lucky Goldstar suffered from rising wage rates, labor unrest, and Korean currency appreciation. In 1989 the group created Goldstar Electron (LG Semicon Co.) and in 1990 business rebounded. Lucky Goldstar acquired 5% of US television maker Zenith in 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 Lucky Goldstar signed an agreement with the government of the Sakha region in Russia to develop the Elga, the world's largest coal field. Lucky Goldstar became the LG Group in 1995, marking its new thrust: globalization. That year it acquired a controlling interest in troubled Zenith, by then the last TV manufacturer in the US.

   The Asian contagion hit in 1997. LG Group announced that it would pull out of 90 business areas, but in 1998 it was one of several
   <i>
    chaebol
   </i>
   caught funneling money to ailing subsidiaries (the
   <i>
    chaebol
   </i>
   were collectively fined $93 million). LG Group members went abroad in 1998 looking for new partners: Among other deals,
   <company id="104934">
    LG Chemicals
   </company>
   allied with top drugmakers such as SmithKline Beecham (now
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   ), Warner-Lambert (now
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   ), and
   <company id="10986">
    Merck
   </company>
   ; and British Telecommunications (now
   <company id="41763">
    BT Group
   </company>
   ) bought a nearly 25% stake in LG Telecom.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under government pressure to consolidate scattered businesses with those of other
   <i>
    chaebol
   </i>
   , LG Group in 1999 agreed to sell LG Semicon and began restructuring its operations. After lengthy negotiations, the
   <company id="41056">
    Hyundai Group
   </company>
   took control of the unit, which became Hyundai MicroElectronics. Electronics giant Philips paid $1.6 billion for a 50% stake in LG Electronics' LCD unit. Meanwhile, LG Group acquired control of
   <company id="116864">
    Dacom
   </company>
   , one of Korea's top long-distance carriers and a leading ISP. In 2000 Dacom opened a high-speed Internet line linking Hong Kong, Japan, and Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking for new markets, in 2001 LG's personal care products (detergents and diapers) unit LG Household &amp; Healthcare launched operations in India. In 2002 LG started its investment in research and development activities for its chemical and electronics business sectors.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 LG sold its DACOM IN, LG Cable, LG Caltex Gas, LG Nikko Copper, and Kukdong City Gas subsidiaries in an effort to divest its noncore operations. Also that year LG completed the restructuring of its operations into a traditional holding-company-type structure, with the new LG to be led by flagship companies
   <company id="55961">
    LG Electronics
   </company>
   and
   <company id="104934">
    LG Chem
   </company>
   . The following year saw
   <company id="138231">
    GS Holdings
   </company>
   splitting away from LG and taking with it LG-Caltex (now
   <company id="57061">
    GS Caltex
   </company>
   ), LG Mart, LG Home Shopping, and GS Sports.
