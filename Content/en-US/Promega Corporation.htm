   Manufacturing unit Promega Biosciences (PBI) combines research in chemistry and manufacturing to serve the scientific community, while Promega BioSystems (PBS) designs and manufactures single-tube and microplate readers for fluorescent and luminescent biological assays. Shanghai Promega Biological Products manufactures reagents and packaging for the Chinese market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another unit, Terso Solutions provides inventory management services to distributors, hospitals, laboratories, and manufacturers. Its system uses radio frequency identification-enabled (RFID-enabled) cabinets, freezers, and refrigerators to help clients keep tabs on the whereabouts of sensitive inventory such as reagents, pharmaceuticals, and hazardous materials. RFID uses radio-wave communication technology to exchange data between a reader and an electronic tag attached to the item being tracked. The technology allows users to maintain close tabs on the supply management chain, usually via web-based applications, in effort to control costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Promega holds hundreds of patents in the areas of nucleic acid purification, human identification, and bioluminescence, as well as in vitro transcription and translation and cell biology.

   Promega is continuously growing its product offerings through research and development efforts; R&amp;D spending accounts for more than 10% of annual revenue expenditures. It focuses on expanding the uses of its current technologies, as well as introducing new add-ons for existing systems and kits. The company also licenses its technologies to other biotech firms.
  </p>
  <p>
   Promega sometimes partners with other companies to expand its service offerings. In 2014 it formed a partnership with Genetic Technologies Limited (GTG), a diagnostics company, through which it received rights in relation to GTG's Intron Sequence Analysis and Genomic Mapping patents.

  <p>
   Growing its product portfolio, in 2014 the company released a new touchscreen interface for the Helix smart on-site stocking program. The touchscreen enhances the Helix experience by providing researchers easy access to relevant information about Promega products, including applications and protocols. It also launched GloMax Discover, an integrated multi-mode detection plate reader system.
