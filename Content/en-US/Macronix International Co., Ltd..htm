   Macronix International manufactures macro quantities of memory. Macronix makes non-volatile memory chips, such as read-only memories (ROMs) and flash memory devices (nonvolatile chips retain data when power is off). Its mask ROM chips (of which it's the largest maker in the world) provide large amounts of immediate memory to consumer electronics, such as PDAs, handheld video games, and digital music players. It also offers other types of semiconductors used in digital voice recorders, digital still cameras, and flat-panel displays. Macronix's top customers include
   <company id="41877">
    Nintendo
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="55961">
    LG Electronics
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   . The company has operations in Asia, Europe, and the Americas.

   Macronix was founded in 1989 by Miin Wu (president) and others. Wu, a Stanford-trained engineer and veteran of
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   , wanted to meld the technology and product innovation typical of US high-tech businesses with the manufacturing productivity common in his native Taiwan.
  </p>
  <p>
   A year after its founding, Macronix launched the first of its many strategic alliances: its chip development pact with Japanese steelmaking giant
   <company id="52309">
    NKK Corporation
   </company>
   , which paved the way for Macronix's entry into the Japanese high-tech market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Macronix opened its first chip fabrication plant, or fab, in mid-1992; the company turned a profit less than a year later. In 1994 it beat out electronics giant
   <company id="41785">
    Sharp
   </company>
   for a key contract with
   <company id="41877">
    Nintendo
   </company>
   to supply the video game maker with mask ROM memory chips for its Ultra 64 game machines.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company went public in 1995 when it began listing its shares on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The following year Macronix became the first Taiwanese company to be listed on the Nasdaq exchange.
  </p>
  <p>
   A brutal pricing war in the memory chip business, coupled with extra costs tied to Macronix's expansion of production capacity, slashed sales and profits for 1997. That year Macronix announced a manufacturing alliance with
   <company id="41823">
    Philips Electronics
   </company>
   to produce microcontrollers of Philips' design.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the semiconductor industry reeled through a worldwide slump, Macronix posted steep losses for 1998. Rebounding demand for flash memories and other chips brought the company back into the black the following year. In 2000 it announced a string of alliances with companies including
   <company id="52289">
    Mitsubishi Electric
   </company>
   (for memory chip outsourcing),
   <company id="43835">
    Tower Semiconductor
   </company>
   (wafer supply),
   <company id="10112">
    Analog Devices
   </company>
   (system-on-a-chip products), and Nintendo (ICs for the Nintendo GameCube).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company extended its long-term alliance with Nintendo in 2001 when Nintendo agreed to supply Macronix with chip manufacturing equipment in return for guaranteed production capacity from one of Macronix's Taiwan factories.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company announced a joint research initiative with
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   and
   <company id="58590">
    Infineon
   </company>
   that would explore a new computer memory technology known as phase-change memory (storing data by changing the state of a special material from an amorphous to a crystalline structure, rather than storing data as an electrical charge). Macronix collaborated with
   <company id="149240">
    Qimonda
   </company>
   , which was spun off from Infineon in 2006, following that company's establishment. Infineon's memory products business became Qimonda.
  </p>
  <p>
   Macronix decided to spin off its Fab I plant and its strategic manufacturing service center in 2005. The combined subsidiary focused on silicon foundry services, doing contract manufacturing for other chip makers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company sold its Fab III facility to
   <company id="149921">
    Powerchip Semiconductor
   </company>
   , another Taiwanese chip maker. Powerchip will produce wafers for Macronix on the 300mm fab line on a contract basis.
