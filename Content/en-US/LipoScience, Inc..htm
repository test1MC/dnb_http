   LipoScience's diagnostic tests are designed to give you the lowdown on your low density lipoprotein, otherwise known as LDL. The company makes in vitro diagnostic tests and analytical tools using its proprietary nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology. Its main
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   -cleared products include the NMR LipoProfile test and the Vantera automated clinical analyzer, which measure and analyze the number of LDL particles in a blood sample in order to help doctors and patients manage heart disease risk. The company was founded in 1994 by its chief scientific officer Dr. James Otvos. LipoScience went public in 2013 with an offering worth $45 million; the following year it was acquired by lab services giant

    LabCorp.

  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Change in Company Type.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The $85 million acquisition added to LabCorp's already expansive suite of personalized diagnostic tests. It also helped LipoScience, which struggled with getting insurers to cover its NMR LipoProfile test, by providing the firm with LabCorp's sheer magnitude in scale. (LabCorp was previously the company's largest customer, accounting for about a third of sales.)

  <p>
   Prior to being acquired by LabCorp, LipoScience used a good portion of the proceeds from its initial public offering to expand its sales force nationally and increase market awareness of the clinical benefits of the NMR LipoProfile test over traditional cholesterol testing. Traditional cholesterol tests are among the most frequently ordered lab tests, with some 75 million run in the US each year, and LipoScience wants to claim 10% of that market.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Already, sales and marketing efforts have led to increased market penetration in the Southeast region in such states as Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and West Virginia. LipoScience plans to spread market awareness across the rest of the US.

  <p>
   LipoScience markets the NMR LipoProfile test through a direct sales force in 21 states. It uses a combination of sales managers, sales representatives, and medical science liaisons to target primary care physicians and cardiologists, as well as a separate team that targets national and regional clinical diagnostic laboratories. It also has a dedicated team of managed care specialists who pursue expanded medical policy coverage of its test with third-party payors.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2011 about 75% of the company's revenues came from clinical diagnostic labs. LipoScience is heavily dependent on two lab customers in particular: New parent LabCorp and Health Diagnostics Laboratory, Inc., together generate more than 50% of LipoScience's revenues.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   LipoScience's primary strategy is to push for nationwide acceptance of NMR screening of LDL particles as a clinical standard of care for managing patients at risk for cardiovascular disease. It believes its NMR LipoProfile test and the Vantera automated clinical analyzer offer a more accurate way to determine an individual's risk than traditional LDL cholesterol tests, also known as lipid panels. LipoScience is entering into agreements with several current clinical diagnostic laboratory customers to place the Vantera system in their facilities. A secondary strategy is using its NMR technology to expand its lineup of diagnostic tests. It is developing a test for use in the prediction of type 2 diabetes, among other diseases, for example.
  </p>
  <p>
   The NMR LipoProfile test is reimbursed by a number of governmental and private payors, but the future commercial success of the product is dependent on US health care reforms. Restructuring the coverage of medical care -- specifically extending coverage to a large population -- could impact reimbursement for diagnostic tests like NMR LipoProfile from federal and state government programs like

    Medicare and Medicaid
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   LipoSciences makes most of its revenue from selling NMR LipoProfile tests to clinical diagnostic labs and other health care customers. A smaller, diminishing portion of revenue is made from standard analytical chemistry tests (called ancillary tests) that are requested by clinicians in conjunction with the NMR LipoProfile test.
  </p>
  <p>
   Total revenues in fiscal 2011 went up 16% over 2010 largely from growth in the number of NMR LipoProfile tests sold. This growth was positively impacted by an increase in number of sales representatives, greater geographic coverage by that sales force, and new customer wins like that of Health Diagnostic Laboratory. However, company earnings dropped from a profit of $4.3 million in 2010 to a net loss of $0.5 million in 2011 as sales and marketing expenses spiked 40% during that same period. Further losses are expected for the next several years as LipoScience pushes NMR LipoProfile sales efforts and develops new diagnostic tests for other diseases.
