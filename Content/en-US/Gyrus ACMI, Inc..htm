It operates through three divisions: Urology and Gynecology, General Surgery, and ENT (ear, nose, and throat). Products range from Invisio digital camera systems to PK workstations used to precisely cut and coagulate tissue. A subsidiary of

  <p>
   Gyrus ACMI was formerly part of the Gyrus Group, which was acquired by Japan's Olympus in 2008 for nearly $2 billion. It was the largest acquisition in Olympus' history. Although better known by consumers for its cameras, Olympus' scientific and medical businesses have long been a core of its growth. Its endoscope products combined with Gyrus' surgical portfolio positioned it to compete with other top surgical device companies.
