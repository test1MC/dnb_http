   NOK Corporation makes oil seals for use in automobiles and industrial machinery. Its largest segment, electronic device products, represents about 50% of total sales and also makes mechanical seals, gaskets, synthetic chemicals, as well as vibration-control rubber and plastic parts. NOK businesses also produce pressure rollers used in photocopiers and other office equipment, specialty lubricants, and flexible printed circuit boards -- the heart of cell phones and various consumer electronics equipment. Founded in 1939, NOK has grown to operate some six plants, a development center, and more than a dozen branches in Asia.

  <p>
   The company's revenue increased 17% from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to growth in electronic device products and marginally due to growth in its seal and roll operations. Electronic device product sales were up due to strong demand for smartphones and automobiles in addition to the impact of favorable exchange rate fluctuations. Seal sales to automobile manufacturers increased on the back of increased demand in North America and China, and roll products were up due to favorable exchange rate fluctuations despite a slump in demand for printers and copiers.
