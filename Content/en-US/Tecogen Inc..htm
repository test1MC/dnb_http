        <p>
   In May 2014, Tecogen sold 647,706 shares priced at $4.75 per share, raising approximately $3 million. The IPO proceeds will be used  to improve or develop key technologies and product lines, including its low-emissions technology business and its CHP and Ilios heat pump products. The company is also looking to bolster its design and installation services business and construct a manufacturing faculty for its Ilios subsidiary. Other proceeds will be used to fund expansion into international markets.
