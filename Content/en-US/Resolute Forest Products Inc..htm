   Resolute Forest Products makes newsprint, commercial printing paper, mechanical paper, pulp, and wood products. It relies on 20 pulp and paper mills and 20 wood products plants in Canada, South Korea, and the US to distribute its products to about 80  countries; it is one of the world's largest recyclers of newspapers and magazines. Resolute owns or has cutting rights to more than 40 million acres of forestland in North America and has power generation assets in Canada. The US account for more than 65% of the company's sales. Canada is its second largest market with about 15% of sales. Other markets for Resolute's products include Brazil, Mexico, Italy, and South Korea.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's reportable segments include newsprint, specialty papers, market pulp, and wood products. Its newsprint is used in advertising inserts, flyers, brochures, circulars, telephone directories, and commercial guides. The company's specialty papers segment is composed of uncoated mechanical papers, including supercalendered, superbright, high bright, bulky book and directory papers, as well as coated mechanical paper.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its market pulp (more than 1.7 million metric tons per year) is sold to a number of overseas markets, and is used in tissue, paper towels, diapers, and printing and writing papers. Resolute's wood products included spruce-pine-fir lumber and are a major source of wood chips for its pulp and paper mills and wood residue the company uses as fuel in its power cogeneration assets and other operations. It also remanufactures and engineers wood for use in mobile homes, roofing, and flooring materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Newsprint and Specialty Papers each accounted for more than 30% of the company's revenues.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Resolute posted revenue declines for the third straight year in 2014, with revenues falling 5% to $4.26 billion. It also posted net losses of $639 million in 2013 and $277 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue drop in 2014 was fueled by declines across three of its segments: newsprint (5%), specialty papers (7%), and market pulp (8%). The segments were negatively affected by a dip in demand for specialty papers products and a drop in average transaction price. It was also affected by the unfavorable effect of the weaker Canadian dollar on sales denominated in that currency in newsprint.

  <p>
   To get its balance sheet out of the red, the company focuses on reducing costs and optimizing its diversified asset base, and capitalizing on its economical access to international markets. Resolute is in the unenviable position of being the largest supplier of newsprint to a dying market: the newspaper industry. Declining demand for its newsprint from newspaper operators throughout North America has the company shutting down paper machines and expanding its product mix and converting its traditional product lines to other market applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Closures in 2014 included the Laurentide paper mill in Shawinigan, Quebec; the pulp and paper mill in Fort Frances, Ontario; the Iroquois Falls (Ontario) newsprint mill, as well as paper machine #1 at Baie-Comeau (Quebec) and paper machine #4 at Clermont (Quebec).

  <p>
   The roots of Bowater can be traced to the founders of its British parent, Bowater PLC (renamed Rexam plc in 1995). After several years with a papermaking firm, William Bowater set up his own business in London in 1881. Cashing in on a booming newspaper readership, W. V. Bowater &amp; Sons secured contracts as a paper wholesaler with two leading newspaper publishers: Alfred Harmsworth (of the
   <i>
    Daily Mail
   </i>
   and the
   <i>
    Daily Mirror
   </i>
   ) and Edward Lloyd (of the
   <i>
    Daily Chronicle
   </i>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1914 Bowater set up a US marketing subsidiary, Hudson Packaging &amp; Paper Co., and in 1919 it opened an Australian office in Sydney. Eric Bowater, the founder's grandson, took over as chairman at the age of 32 and led the company in a major expansion. By 1936 Bowater accounted for 60% of Britain's newsprint output, up from just 22% only six years before. Bowater began manufacturing in North America in 1938, when it purchased a pulp and newsprint mill in Corner Brook, Newfoundland.
  </p>
  <p>
   WWII had a devastating impact on the company's UK newsprint business, and output fell by 80%. Bowater PLC diversified into paper packaging in 1944, buying Acme Corrugated Cases. Bowater PLC expanded its presence in the US in 1954 with the opening of Bowater Southern, a newsprint mill in Tennessee. That year Eric Bowater died. Christopher Chancellor, formerly with Reuters, became CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1964 Bowater formed Bowater United States Corp. to manage its US operations. Bowater moved away from paper production in the 1970s, diversifying into such areas as packaging, tissue products, building products, commodity trading, and foodstuffs. In 1984 Bowater exited the paper and pulp business, spinning off its US operations as Bowater Incorporated.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the spinoff, the new US-based Bowater expanded its range of products. In 1991 the company acquired an 80% interest in Great Northern Paper (GNP); it acquired the remaining 20% in 1992. The next year Bowater started up the GNP recycling facilities; completed the consolidation of its corporate headquarters in Greenville, South Carolina; and sold 70,000 acres of nonstrategic timberlands.
  </p>
  <p>
   Arnold Nemirow, former CEO of
   <company id="15126">
    Wausau Paper Mills
   </company>
   (Wisconsin), became Bowater's COO in 1994; subsequently, he became CEO and chairman. After three years of losses (largely due to a slump in paper prices), the company turned around in 1995, aided by cost-reduction programs, the sale of timberlands, and higher paper prices. In 1996 Bowater sold its Star Forms subsidiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bowater bought Montreal-based Avenor in 1998 for $2.4 billion, which was 25% more than the hostile takeover bid from rival
   <company id="51067">
    Abitibi-Consolidated
   </company>
   . Although the cost contributed to a loss that year, Bowater became the world's #2 newsprint maker with the acquisition.
  </p>
  <p>
   A slump in newsprint prices occurred in 1999, and the company sold GNP (exiting the directory paper business) and more than 1.5 million acres of timberlands in Maine and the Carolinas. Also that year Bowater bought a South Korean paper mill.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Bowater implemented several price increases as the market for newsprint began to improve. The company bought Canada's
   <company id="56761">
    Alliance Forest Products
   </company>
   in 2001 in a deal worth $770 million. The acquisition added three paper mills and 10 sawmill facilities. Later Bowater combined its Canadian subsidiaries, Bowater Pulp and Paper Canada and Bowater Canadian Forest Products (formerly Alliance Forest Products), into a new Canadian forest products unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bowater announced job cuts in 2002 (up to 500) and in 2003 announced the closing of a specialty paper machine in Quebec, a move that reduced production capacity by 100,000 metric tons annually.
  </p>
  <p>
   CEO Arnold Nemirow retired in 2006;
   <company id="10648">
    Georgia-Pacific
   </company>
   veteran David Paterson succeeded him in the position. In addition, Paterson began serving as chairman at the beginning of 2007 (he resigned in early 2011). That year the company merged with rival Abitibi-Consolidated to form North America's largest newsprint producer.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company faced financial challenges early on, and received a $350 million investment from
   <company id="56469">
    Fairfax Financial
   </company>
   in 2008. The investment was part of a $1.4 billion refinancing plan. Early in 2008 the company sold its mill in Snowflake, Arizona, to
   <company id="56638">
    Catalyst Paper Corporation
   </company>
   for $161 million in cash. The sale of the mill, which has an annual capacity of 375,000 tons, was part of a deal to satisfy antitrust regulators in light of the merger.
  </p>
  <p>
   Greenpeace activists blockaded the world headquarters of AbitibiBowater in 2008 to protest the company's alleged continued destruction of the last remaining intact areas of the Boreal Forest. The company manages the largest tract of publicly owned forest in Canada (about 55 million acres). Greenpeace's outreach to major AbitibiBowater customers has resulted in a loss of several million dollars in purchase contracts because of environmental concerns.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the company filed for Chapter 11 in US Bankruptcy Court as well as bankruptcy protection in Canada. It had a debt of almost $9 billion -- just shy of the value of its total listed assets. Citing various reasons -- a decline in advertising, credit crunch, and decreased newsprint demand -- the company set about to restructure its operations. AbitibiBowater cut jobs, shuttered underperforming mills, and sold non-core assets. In early 2009 the company sold more than 189,000 acres of timberland in Quebec for C$70 million. AbitibiBowater subsequently shed another 300,000 acres of Quebec timberland for C$53 million. It sold its 60% interest in the hydroelectric dam on the Manicouagan River to
   <company id="55848">
    Hydro-Québec
   </company>
   for C$615 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   With approval from the Quebec Superior Court, the company struck a deal in 2009 with
   <company id="56469">
    Fairfax Financial Holdings
   </company>
   , a major shareholder, and other investors, for about $350 million in emergency debtor-in-possession financing for some of its subsidiaries. Subsequently, AbitibiBowater won court approval for more financing. AbitibiBowater also proposed a debt-for-equity swap transaction to its noteholders, a move intended to trim its debt by $2.4 billion. The company was allowed to enter into a loan agreement with
   <company id="42380">
    Bank of Montreal
   </company>
   for $100 million debtor-in-possession financing. It continued an existing securitization program for its accounts receivable, providing another $210 million in financing.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to save as many jobs as possible, AbitibiBowater asked workers for concessions to help the company through its restructuring. Of the company's 15,000 active employees around the world, approximately 11,600 employees were represented by the CEP (Communications, Energy, and Paperworkers Union of Canada) and the United Steelworkers in the US. (A tentative agreement was reached in spring 2010 with the CEP, with the proposal to terminate pension plans stricken from the deal.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Resolute Forest Products emerged from bankruptcy in 2010, after filing voluntary petitions for Chapter 11 in the US and protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act in Canada in 2009. At the time of its bankruptcy filings, the company was almost $9 billion in debt (much of it amassed in the 2007 merger of Abitibi and Bowater); it emerged owing less than $1 billion dollars. Along with the expunged debt, so went many noncore assets, and 15% of its employee base.
