   Barnes Group keeps a spring in its step. The aerospace and industrial components manufacturer produces precision engineered springs for electronics and machinery, nitrogen gas products used to control stamping presses, as well as fabricated components and assemblies for turbine engines and airframes. The group also offers commercial and military aviation customers repair services, primarily on aerospace spare parts. Its customers include original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of aircraft engines, consumer electronics, farm equipment, home appliances, and medical devices, located worldwide, but primarily in the US.

   Barnes is organized into two segments: Industrial (66% of total sales) and Aerospace (34%). Aerospace makes precision-machined and fabricated components and assemblies for turbine engine, airframe, and industrial gas turbine OEMs. This segment also supplies aerospace aftermarket spare parts. The Industrial segment supplies precision components for industries that include transportation, energy, electronics, and medical and consumer products.

  <p>
   Barnes has seen its balance sheet fluctuate over the last several years. After experiencing a surge in sales for 2014, it saw its sales fall 5% to $1.2 billion in 2015. Its profits also remained static during 2014 and 2015, hovering around the $120 million mark for both years. Its cash flow from operations climbed by 12% from 2014 to 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company in 2015 reported decreased sales from both its Industrial (5%) and Aerospace (6%) segments. During the year, a softening within the transportation and general industrial end-markets tempered a substantial portion of organic growth. In addition, the impact of foreign currency translation decreased sales by almost $70 million as the US dollar strengthened against foreign currencies.

  <p>
   Barnes often uses acquisitions as a means to fortify its two business segments. In 2015 it purchased Switzerland-based Priamus System Technologies AG, a designer of advanced process control systems used for the plastic injection molding industry within the medical, automotive, consumer goods, electronics, and packaging markets. Priamus is being integrated into its Industrial segment.

   In 2015 it also picked up Italy-based Thermoplay, a business that specializes in the design, development, and manufacturing of hot runner systems for plastic injection molding, primarily in the packaging, automotive, and medical end markets. Thermoplay is also being integrated into the Industrial segment.

  <p>
   Targeting the clock and hoopskirt industries, Wallace Barnes and E. L. Dunbar started making springs in 1857. In 1897 the company incorporated as Wallace Barnes Co. It merged with two other companies to form Associated Spring Corporation in 1927. In 1946 Associated Spring started trading over the counter in 1946, and it made the jump to the New York Stock Exchange in 1963. In 1964 the company acquired distributor Bowman Products and also expanded its spring business into Mexico. Associated Spring entered England and France in 1973. In 1976 the company changed its name to Barnes Group.
