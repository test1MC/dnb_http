   Mitsubishi Motors is a small fish in the big pond of global car manufacturing. The company sells about a million cars per year (far below rival
   <company id="41889">
    Toyota
   </company>
   ) worldwide. The 20 models of cars, trucks, minivans, and SUVs are made at its plants in Asia, Europe, and the US. Mitsubishi products include the Lancer, Pajero, Triton, Mirage, and Outlander vehicles. It also offers an electric minicar under its i-MiEV model.

   together own about a 30% stake in Mitsubishi Motors, which traces its roots to Heavy Industries' 1917 "Mitsubishi Model A" project. About 80% of sales come from outside of Japan. In 2016

   Mitsubishi sees its future in electric vehicles, which it has been developing since 1966. The company develops plug-in hybrids and other electric vehicles through its research and development facilities and through joint ventures with other auto makers. In 2014 it announced a partnership with
   <company id="41879">
    Nissan
   </company>
   and other car makers to develop and manufacture new electric minicars and promote a charging network.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mitsubishi already has an electric minicar, the i-MiEV, on the market in Japan and Europe. (Minicars are a popular vehicle class in the Japanese and European markets and are gaining popularity in other parts of the world.) While it sells in Japan under its own brand, the MiEV is sold in Europe through an agreement with French car maker
   <company id="41827">
    Peugeot S.A.
   </company>
   , which buys and resells MiEV under a different brand.

  <p>
   In 2015 Mitsubishi's net sales increased by 4% in 2015 compared to 2014. The growth was driven by increased sales from both its automobile and automobile financing businesses. Stronger North American sales were driven by brisk sales of the Outlander Sport and Mirage as an economic recovery within the US grew stronger.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mitsubishi's net income also climbed 13% from 2014 to 2015 due to increased sales, decreased advertising and promotion expenses, an absence of a share issuance cost, and gains on a revision of its retirement benefit plan.

   As it has in years past, the company also continues to turn to emerging markets to increase its sales and boost profits. It has been targeting its products to customers in emerging markets like China, Russia, the Ukraine, and other countries in Asia and Eastern Europe. Other sales-boosting initiatives featured a new plant being launched in the Philippines in January 2015. The new plant is continuing with the production of the Adventure and L300 models and produces up to 50,000 units per year, exceeding the production capacity at a previous plant.

  <p>
   The company was hit by a major scandal in 2016 after it was revealed that it had cheated on fuel economy tests for several years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Mitsubishi acquired Asian Transmission Corporation (ATC) from Mitsubishi Motors Philippines Corporation (MMPC) and Sojitz Corporation (Sojitz)  A production base for components, ATC supplies transmissions and engines for automobiles, and the deal will reinforce Mitsubishi 's production base in the ASEAN countries, where the automobile market is expected to experience sustainable growth.

  <p>
   Mitsubishi Motors Corporation was created in 1970 when Mitsubishi Heavy Industries spun off its motor vehicle division. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was created in 1934 by the merger of Mitsubishi Aircraft and Mitsubishi Shipbuilding (which had been making cars since 1917).
