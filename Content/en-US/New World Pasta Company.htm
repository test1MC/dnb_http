   Getting into hot water is one of the goals of New World Pasta. The company is a leading manufacturer of branded dry pasta in the US and Canada. New World Pasta makes and markets brands such as American Beauty, Ronzoni, No Yolks, San Giorgio, Creamette, Prince, Light 'n Fluffy, Wacky Mac, and Skinner. It makes a high-fiber pasta called Ronzoni Healthy Harvest and a whole-grain version under the Ronzoni Smart Taste label. Its foodstuffs are sold in North America through retail grocers, wholesale clubs, drug and convenience stores, mass merchandisers, foodservice purveyors, and others. Since 2006, New World Pasta has been owned by Spain's
   <company id="92734">
    Ebro Foods
   </company>
   , one of the world's leading pasta manufacturers. In 2017 parent Ebro is expected to merge New World Pasta with two other business units.

   Headquartered in Pennsylvania, New World Pasta's North American manufacturing plants are located in Fresno, California; St. Louis, Missouri; and Winchester, Virginia. The company's Canadian division, Ronzoni Foods Canada Corporation, produces Catelli and Lancia-branded pastas in Montreal, Quebec. Cantelli is a top pasta in the region.

  <p>
   New World Pasta's multibrand strategy gives the company a commanding presence at the dinner table. Indeed, the pasta maker has a market share of nearly 25% in the US and about a third of the market in Canada. To grow, New World Pasta regularly rolls out new products to extend its reach to new customers and looks to expand its portfolio through acquisitions. The company is looking to spend more on advertising to enhance the value of its pasta brands, and launch a new line of sauces to complete its "meal solutions" offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Previously, New World Pasta entered the convenience food market with its Bistro line of pasta meals packaged in shelf-stable pouches. For picky, vegetable-averse eaters, the pasta maker offers a Garden Delight Pasta that contains a full serving of vegetables per one 4-oz. portion. To bring on board popular consumer brands, New World Pasta acquired the No Yolks noodles and Wacky Mac Pasta brands from Strom Products in 2011.

  <p>
   Best known for its dry pastas, the company is looking to expand its fresh pasta menu. In 2013 the company began construction of a new fresh pasta factory.

   To further streamline its North American business functions under parent Ebro Foods, New World Pasta consolidated its sales force with rice company
   <company id="41433">
    Riviana Foods
   </company>
   (also owned by Ebro) in 2009. The move offers one national pasta and rice sales team. Previously, the two Ebro units had combined their finance, logistics, and distribution operations.

   Ebro sold its dairy operations in 2010 to focus on rice and pasta.

   New World Pasta purchased the pasta business of chocolate candy giant
   <company id="10722">
    Hershey
   </company>
   in 1999 for $362 million. While demand for pasta was still
   <i>
    al dente
   </i>
   , the new company found independence a bit overcooked. In 2002 New World announced its financial statements were in question, and fired its auditors
   <company id="40270">
    KPMG
   </company>
   . In 2003 the CEO and CFO resigned abruptly. Officers brought in from

   </company>
   led the company until Wynn Willard was named CEO later that year. In 2004 the company filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. Shortly after the filing, Willard was replaced by Lisa Donahue, a principal at the Detroit-based turn-around firm
   <company id="100135">
    AlixPartners LLC
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2004, New World hired bankruptcy firm
   <company id="41132">
    Kirkland &amp; Ellis
   </company>
   . The company had announced in March 2004 that it had received permission from its creditors to delay filing its 2003 annual report until the end of 2004. New World filed its reorganization plan in July 2005. The company reached an agreement with lenders
   <company id="15970">
    Morgan Stanley Senior Funding
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="106285">
    GE Commercial Finance
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="58450">
    Wells Fargo Foothill
   </company>
   in September to finance $240 million for its exit from Chapter 11, which occurred in December of that year. Coinciding with the company's emergence, interim CEO Donahue was replaced by Scott Greenwood of bakery supply company, Puratos. New World's restructuring included the 2004 closing of a manufacturing facility in Omaha, Nebraska. The company's Canadian operations were not part of its bankruptcy filing.

   In late-2011 New World Pasta acquired the No Yolks noodles and Wacky Mac Pasta brands from Strom Products.
