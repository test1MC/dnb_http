   Like a well-performing ATM machine, Hoffer Plastics turns plastic into cash. The US custom injection-molding company makes plastic products for the automotive, communications, consumer goods, and soft drink industries. Products range from tamper-resistant closures to engine components, headlight covers, flashlight and beeper casings, and even dispensing valves for

   syrup, used in soft drink machines worldwide. Hoffer Plastics manufactures small, intricate, single-cavity molds to molds with more than 200 cavities. Still led by the founding Hoffer family, the company also offers engineering design (primarily part and tool design) and support services.

   One of the keys to Hoffer's success has been its stringent control over operating costs and preservation of its debt-free status. The company uses only internal funds to finance expansions, reportedly made every three years. Capital expansions have included an electric generation facility to produce the company's own power. Its wide diversity of products has also allowed it to persevere when other molders have gone out of business.
