   If you're not sitting down for this, Flexsteel Industries might ask why not. It's not as if the company hasn't given you plenty of options. Flexsteel, incorporated in 1929, makes wood and upholstered furniture for every room in the home, as well as for the recreational vehicle and commercial markets. Most of its upholstered products -- including recliners, rockers, and sofas -- incorporate a unique drop-in spring for which the company is named. Crafting its goods mostly in the US, Flexsteel distributes to furniture retailers, department stores, catalog companies, RV manufacturers, hotels, and health care facilities. The company's

   unit produces furnishings for the home and office.

   Iowa-based Flexsteel boasts operations throughout North America, operating manufacturing facilities in Arkansas, California, Georgia, Iowa, Mississippi, and Mexico in the city of Juarez.

   Residential customers account for some 80% of Flexsteel's revenue; commercial customers generation the remaining 20%.

   Flexsteel sells its products through its own sales force and through independent representatives nationwide. The company's also spending more money on advertising -- including national trade advertising programs -- in recent years, shelling out $6.1 million in fiscal 2014, up from 2013's $5.6 million and $4.9 million in 2012.

   To leverage the company's more well-known name, Flexsteel integrated the Wynwood product line into its namesake line. The firm aims to extend the reach of its marketplace by rolling out a combined Flexsteel Wynwood Collection in 2014.

  <p>
   Flexsteel's sales have been trending upward during the past five years. In fiscal 2014 (ended June), the company logged a 14% increase in revenue to $438.5 million vs. $386.2 million in 2013. It points to $359.6 million in residential sales -- representing an increase of $48.3 million from the previous reporting period -- for the gains, thanks to increased demand for upholstered and ready-to-assemble products and a more than 5% sales boost from its commercial business.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the past four years, the furniture maker has seen its net profits rise, to $14.9 million in 2014 from $13.2 million in 2013. Additionally, while the company's cash flow has been on a downward trend until 2013, Flexsteel posted a cash flow of $16.2 million, representing an increase of $10.3 million, due in part to $15 million in net income and litigation settlement costs during the reporting period.

  <p>
   The furniture maker's production model includes integrating manufactured products from its half-dozen plants in the US and Mexico with finished products purchased from offshore suppliers in Asia. Flexsteel has been paring down its operations in recent years in response to decreased demand for furniture. To this end, Flexsteel in recent years consolidated a pair of manufacturing plants and halted production at another, contributing to a noteworthy 30% workforce reduction.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, however, Flexsteel's in investment mode. The company is investing up to $40 million to purchase and equip a Midwest distribution center, and spending another $6 million in other operating capital expenditures during fiscal 2015.

  <p>
   Frank Bertsch, a German immigrant furniture maker living in Minneapolis, and several partners bought the Rolph &amp; Ball Furniture Co. in 1901 and renamed it Grau-Curtis after two of the partners. Bertsch bought out his partners in 1917. The company began using an innovative spring system designed by Swiss inventor Werner Schlaprittzi in 1927. That year it bought half of Schlaprittzi's Sanitas Spring Co.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company renamed itself Northome Furniture Industries in 1929, and Bertsch was succeeded by his son, Herbert (who had joined the company in 1919). Sanitas Spring was renamed Flexsteel Spring (the name of its patented seating spring system) in 1934 and in 1936 the company moved to Dubuque. In 1947 Herbert's son, Frank, joined Northome. The company bought its remaining stake in Flexsteel Spring in 1948, and in 1958 Northome became Flexsteel. It began making RV seating in the 1960s and first produced recliners in 1965. The company went public in 1969.
  </p>
  <p>
   As its primary customers -- small to medium-sized retailers -- succumbed to bigger chains in the 1980s, Flexsteel began to market its products more aggressively by establishing Flexsteel Galleries and Comfort Seating Showrooms (later renamed Flexsteel Comfort Galleries) in dealers' stores. The younger Frank Bertsch's cousin, Jack Crahan, was named CEO in 1990; Bruce Lauritsen succeeded him in 1993. Profits slumped in 1995 and 1996 as a result of sagging sales, higher material costs, and a costly plant upgrade. The company also began opening freestanding stores in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Flexsteel purchased the bankrupt Dygert Seating (a maker of seats installed in light trucks and van conversions). But a sluggish van conversion market caused the company to close its Watkinsville, Georgia, plant and seek new markets such as wheelchairs and motorized scooters. In 1998 Flexsteel underwent a $2 million expansion project at its Dublin, Georgia, plant.
  </p>
  <p>
   When one of its customers, National Comfort Seating, closed the doors of several Indiana furniture stores in 2000, Flexsteel took over operation, reopening them as Comfort Seating -- Flexsteel Home Furnishings stores. A slowing economy and lowered sales of recreational vehicles (RVs) were blamed for layoffs (about 7%) at the Dubuque, Iowa, plant in 2001. Bruce Boylen, a retired executive from RV maker

   , became chairman the same year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In October 2003 Flexsteel completed its acquisition of DMI Furniture. The next month the company discontinued its retail operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ron Klosterman took over as CEO in late 2006.
