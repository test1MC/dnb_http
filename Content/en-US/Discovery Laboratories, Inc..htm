   If you're waiting to exhale, Windtree Therapeutics may be able to help. Formerly named Discovery Laboratories, the biotechnology company focuses on treatments for respiratory disorders. It bases its therapies on surfactants, which are naturally produced by the lungs and essential for breathing. The firm's only product, Surfaxin, gained
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval in 2012 for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants. Another candidate, Aerosurf (licensed from
   <company id="55933">
    Philip Morris
   </company>
   ), will allow for the delivery of RDS surfactant medicine in aerosol form, and is being developed as an alternative to endotracheal intubation and conventional mechanical ventilation. The firm also makes respiratory drug delivery devices.

  <p>
   Surfactant replacement therapies may prove to be particularly helpful to premature babies because their lungs are not fully developed. Infants in respiratory distress are typically given animal-derived surfactants to help them absorb oxygen. Windtree Therapeutics' Surfaxin is a synthetic variety and therefore could even be manufactured in large enough quantities to treat respiratory disorders that affect greater numbers of people.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the company is developing Surfaxin LS, a lyophilized (dry powder) formulation of Surfaxin that would eliminate the need for cold-chain storage of the Surfaxin product. Other potential disease targets for the company's research programs include acute lung injury, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cystic fibrosis.

   Windtree Therapeutics owns a manufacturing facility, which it bought from its former contract manufacturer
   <company id="140050">
    Laureate Pharma
   </company>
   . With direct operational control, the company has been working to build up its manufacturing capabilities enough to support the commercial production of its products. It is also building up its sales resources and looking for commercialization partners for its products.

   Windtree Therapeutics uses ASD Specialty Healthcare to distribute Surfaxin and Afectair in the US. It contracts with Laboratories del Dr. Esteve to distribute its products in parts of Europe.

   The company has broadened its initial focus on infant respiratory problems to include adults as well. To that end, it plans to continue developing products using its Aerosurf platform, expanding uses for existing products, and creating an entire line for respiratory critical care.
