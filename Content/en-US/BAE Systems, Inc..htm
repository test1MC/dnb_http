   BAE Systems takes care of business in North America for UK-based parent
   <company id="40681">
    BAE SYSTEMS plc
   </company>
   -- the largest foreign player in the US defense market. BAE Systems' military operations include the design, manufacture, and maintenance of armored combat vehicles, weapons, munitions, and other defense systems. Affiliate BAE Systems also provides security information technology (IT) systems for defense, commercial, and law enforcement applications. It is a top supplier to the
   <company id="105717">
    US Department of Defense
   </company>
   (DoD), and adheres to the Pentagon's Special Security Agreement to ensure control of sensitive technology.

   The US division has operations in 38 states and in Germany, Israel, Mexico, South Africa, Sweden, and the UK.

   Given the US budget cuts under the Obama administration, many of the major defense players, such as
   <company id="11261">
    Raytheon
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10903">
    Lockheed Martin
   </company>
   have realigned their operations similarly to encompass electronics, aerospace, and information systems and services.

  <p>
   BAE Systems has been transitioning to a more manageable and cost-efficient structure. Although anticipation is high that there will be less government spending for traditional weapon systems (like combat vehicles), the Obama administration has signaled a move to build more high-tech systems that allow for military responsiveness, speed, flexibility, and precision.
  </p>
  <p>
   BAE Systems is also supporting the development of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) -- another project earmarked for continued government funding.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a move that would expand its services for water-borne craft, BAE Systems plans to enlarge the dry-docking capabilities at its San Diego shipyard in 2015. On the expansion punch list are improvements to ship repair, maintenance, and modernization services for the
   <company id="150763">
    Navy
   </company>
   , other government agencies, and commercial customers. The project could total about $100 million.

  <p>
   In 2014 BAE Systems acquired SilverSky, a commercial cyber service provider for $232.5 million (approximately Â£144.4 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   In another 2014 deal BAE Systems acquired Signal Innovations Group Inc., a provider of imaging technologies and analytics to US intelligence and defense communities. Signal had been a supplier to BAE Systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   BAE Systems $28 million acquisition of Eclipse Electronic Systems Inc. was expected to be final in early 2015. Eclipse, a wholly owned subsidiary of
   <company id="10534">
    Esterline Corporation
   </company>
   , develops intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) for defense and intelligence community purposes. The Eclipse operations will round out BAE Systems' ISR offerings.
