   The work of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company started way back in 1781, when its predecessor began selling traditional Japanese and Chinese remedies. These days, Takeda is one of Asia's largest pharmaceutical companies, making branded prescription drugs that it sells in some 100 countries worldwide. Top-selling products include blood pressure treatment Blopress, diabetes drug Actos, and ulcer medication Prevacid. The company is also a leading maker of over-the-counter medications, such as cold remedies and vitamins, within its home country. Takeda markets many of its products in the US through subsidiary Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The Japanese drug giant operates through about 60 primarily wholly owned subsidiaries throughout the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Its three reportable segments are Ethical Drugs (representing 90% of total revenues), Consumer Healthcare (OTC drugs and quasi-drugs), and Other (reagents, clinical diagnostics, chemical products, and other lines of business). The company's R&amp;D functions are aligned into four therapeutic areas: Gastroenterology (GI), Oncology, Central Nervous System (CNS), and Cardiovascular/Metabolic (CVM).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Takeda is Japan's largest pharmaceutical company with a vast global reach. Japan, its largest market, accounts for nearly half of total sales. The US is the pharmaceutical maker's largest foreign market, contributing nearly a quarter of sales. Europe, other regions in Asia, and beyond represent another quarter. Non-Asian growth markets include India, Russia, and Brazil.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's network spans more than 70 countries and regions around the world in the Asia/Pacific region, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Takeda has R&amp;D sites in Japan, the US, Brazil, the UK, Germany, China, and Singapore.
  </p>

  <p>
   Takeda's sales increased 5% in fiscal 2015 (ended March), largely due to growth in sales of antihypertensive agent AZILVA and hyperlipidemia treatment LOTRIGA in Japan. US sales of VELCADE (for patients with multiple myeloma) and ENTYVIO (for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, launched in 2014) have been highly successful, while in Europe, sales of ADCETRIS (for malignant lymphona) have also grown.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company reported a net loss of ¥143 billion in fiscal 2015, versus net income in 2014, as a result of lower finance income and a huge income tax provision that year. Cash flow from operations rose 23% to ¥182 billion.
  </p>

  <p>
   Takeda's growth strategy includes advancing its market position in North America by cultivating sales of its existing products (Actos and Prevacid) as well as through sales of newer products including Uloric, a drug to help manage uric acid levels in patients with gout, and heartburn treatment Dexilant (formerly known as Kapidex). As sales in the US and other regions have grown, the company's domestic sales have languished, in part due to price reductions imposed by Japan's National Health Insurance agency and other market factors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Takeda is looking to expand in markets like India, Russia, and Brazil, especially in research and development. It also is pursuing growth in Europe, where it acquired Swiss drug maker
   <company id="159478">
    Nycomed
   </company>
   . Like many of its rivals, Takeda is facing the end of patent protection for some of its drugs while the sales of some of its top products such as Prevacid have peaked. Also like its rivals, it is trying to replace those aging products with new blockbuster drugs, particularly in its core areas of lifestyle-related illnesses (high blood pressure and diabetes, for instance); cancer; central nervous system (CNS) disorders; and gastroenterology. Lifestyle-related disorders have long been Takeda's strongest area, but with that market maturing, the company has been forced to expand into other therapeutic areas. In 2016 it established a generic drugs joint venture with
   <company id="52434">
    Teva Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   in order to better focus on the development of new drugs while also benefiting from Japan's growing demand for generics.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company often enters collaborations with other pharmaceuticals to develop and/or commercialize new products. For example, in 2015 it entered an agreement with Chemo-Sero-Therapeutic Research Institute for the distribution of that firm's seasonal influenza vaccine in Japan. Takeda also distributes the Influenza HA Vaccine manufactured by Denka Seiken. In 2015, Takeda and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma terminated their agreement to develop antipsychotic Latuda in Europe; in another move, Takeda and AMAG Pharmaceuticals terminated their licensing, development, and commercialization agreement for Ferumoxytol outside of the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2014, the company launched three new products, obtained two successful approvals, and completed one new drug application. The FDA approved its Contrave tablets for chronic weight management that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Takeda established a new regional hub in Singapore in early 2015; it includes Asia/Pacific commercial operations, vaccine operations, and the Takeda Development Center Asia.

  <p>
   In early 2017 Takeda acquired US-based cancer drug developer
   <company id="20062">
    Ariad Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   for $5.2 billion. That deal helped the company expand in oncology, a priority therapeutic area.
