   Financial Performance
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's revenues was restated in 2015 due to the sale of its Chemicals business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net revenues decreased by 17% as Mining Services Australia/Pacific segments declined due to lower volumes, contract losses, and a decrease in service levels requested by customers as a result of cost pressures.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Orica posted a net loss of A$1.40 billion (compared to net income of A$0.63 billion in 2014) mainly due to lower net revenues and a presence of the impairment of property, plant and equipment and impairment of intangibles in current year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's operating cash inflow decreased by 19%.
