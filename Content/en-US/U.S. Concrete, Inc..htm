   When things get hard, U.S. Concrete's products get even harder. The company produces ready-mixed concrete, precast concrete, and related materials and services for commercial, residential, and infrastructure construction projects. U.S. Concrete has a fleet of about 1,360 mixer trucks and about 145 ready-mixed concrete, concrete block, and 10 aggregate plants. During 2015, the company produced some 7 million cu. yd. of concrete and more than 4.9 million tons of aggregates; concrete accounts for about 90% of the company's sales. U.S. Concrete concentrates on major markets such as California, New Jersey/New York, and Texas.

  <p>
   The company operates principally in Texas, California, and New Jersey/New York, with those markets representing approximately 40%, 29%, and 26%, respectively, in 2015. It provides its ready-mixed concrete and concrete-related products from its operations in north and west Texas; northern California; New Jersey; New York; Washington, DC; and Oklahoma. In addition, U.S. Concrete produces precast concrete products at one plant in Pennsylvania.

  <p>
   U.S. Concrete saw its revenues jump 39% from $704 million in 2014 to a record-setting $975 million in 2015. Its profits also climbed 24% from $21 million in 2014 to $26 million in 2015 mainly due to an income tax benefit it earned. The historic revenues for 2015 were driven by growth in sales of ready-mixed concrete and additional revenue from acquisitions.

  <p>
   U.S. Concrete has achieved milestone revenues over the years, in part, by acquiring smaller operators -- part of its continuous growth strategy. During 2015, the company completed eight acquisitions that expanded its operations in its existing markets and into the US Virgin Islands market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company acquired the assets of NYCON Supply Corp., a ready-mixed concrete producer headquartered in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, New York. NYCON's premier location widened its footprint to serve the New York City market and expanded its regional customer base.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2016, U.S. Concrete obtained the assets of Greco Brothers Concrete, a ready-mixed concrete producer located in Brooklyn, New York. The deal is expected to offer new opportunities to service its expanded customer base, optimize service efficiencies, and enhance raw material purchasing savings.
