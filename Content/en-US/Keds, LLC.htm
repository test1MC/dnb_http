   Keds sneaked its way into popular culture long ago. The term "sneakers" was coined for Keds in 1916 because the rubber soles of the shoes made them relatively quiet. U.S. Rubber Company attached the Keds brand to its line of mass-marketed canvas sneakers, which gained popularity as both an athletic and fashion shoe. To cater to casual and chic customers, Keds has expanded its products to include slip-ons, sandals, skimmers, and even designer styles. The company positions itself as an iconic American brand as well as an athletic lifestyle shoe. Keds is owned by

   , which acquired it, along with several other brands (including Sperry Top-Sider, and Stride Rite), from Collective Brands in 2012.

   Wolverine World Wide acquired the wholesale and retail operations of Keds and former parent company Stride Rite (which bought Keds in 1979) by purchasing the Performance + Lifestyle Group (PLG) from Collective Brands in late 2012 for more than $1.2 billion.

   To bolster its appeal to young, fashionable women, Keds launched a footwear collection with recording artist Taylor Swift in spring 2013.
