   Ophthotech isn't taking a wait-and-see attitude towards eye disease. The biopharmaceutical company is developing a new treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. Ophthotech's most promising candidate is Fovista, a drug to be used in conjunction with
   <company id="10628">
    Genentech
   </company>
   's Lucentis. Fovista, which is injected into the eye, has entered phase 3 clinical trials. Another candidate, Zimura, is being developed for the treatment of geographic atrophy, a form of dry AMD. The company went public in 2013.

  <p>
   The company raised $167 million in its initial public offering. It has used that funding for such activities as advancing clinical studies and commercialization efforts for Fovista.

   The company generated revenue for the first time in 2014. That year, a commercialization agreement with
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   for Fovista brought collaboration revenue totaling $41.3 million. Ophthotech has yet to make money through product sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has been operating at a loss since its inception, and it should continue to do so for the foreseeable future as it works to fund research and development, manufacturing, and administrative activities. R&amp;D expenses increased in 2014 as the firm entered into its collaboration with Novartis -- Ophthotech paid a milestone payment of $19.8 million towards the development of Fovista. This in turn led net loss to nearly double, reaching $41.3 million. As of the end of 2014, the company's accumulated deficit totaled $281.2 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ophthotech saw an inflow of $111 million in cash from operations in 2014 (versus an outflow in 2013), largely due to its generation of revenue for the first time.

  <p>
   In 2014, the company entered into an agreement with Novartis, giving Novartis rights to commercialize Fovista outside of the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beyond its key candidates Fovista and Zimura, Ophthotech is dedicated to exploring other possible treatments for AMD.
