   NewLink Genetics is hoping to give a boost to the immune systems of cancer patients. A biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering cancer treatments, NewLink develops and commercializes small-molecule immunotherapy therapies that stimulate patients' immune systems. Its HyperAcute Pancreas platform is designed to treat surgically-resected pancreatic cancer patients undergoing standard chemotherapy treatments. (Surgically-resected patients are those who have had tumors removed.) The candidate was in late-stage clinical development but was dropped in 2016; the company also has similar candidates in earlier-stages of development to treat lung and skin cancer. Founded in 1999, NewLink went public in 2011.

  <p>
   Prior to the IPO, the company's owners included founder and CEO Dr. Charles J. Link, who held a 16% stake, and crop seed producer Stine Seed Farm, which held a 22% stake. NewLink used the proceeds raised in its $44 million IPO to fund continued development of HyperAcute Pancreas.

  <p>
   While NewLink isn't producing any products of its own, it does earn revenue from its BioProtection Systems Corporation, which conducts contract research for the

    Department of Defense

   (DOD) and the
   <company id="100358">
    National Institutes of Health

   (NIH).

  <p>
   Like many biopharmaceutical companies, NewLink does not bring in much revenue and has not been profitable since its inception. It has sustained its discovery and development efforts mainly through private investment and government grants. The company hopes to eventually generate income through the commercialization of HyperAcute Pancreas and its other candidates in the US and select international markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 revenue dropped 10% as the company took in less money from DOD contracts and NIH grants. Correspondingly, net income continued to drop as NewLink paid more for R&amp;D and clinical trial expenses. The company's total deficit stands at $105 million.

  <p>
   In 2016 the company stopped development of is pancreatic cancer immunotherapy algenpantucel-L, which failed in phase 3 clinical tests. The future of its HyperAcute platform is under evaluation.
  </p>
  <p>
   NewLink intends to conduct sales and marketing for its approved products in the US and seek partnerships to sell in international markets. Treatments similar to HyperAcute Pancreas but for lung and kidney cancer and melanoma patients are next up in the pipeline. Commercialization of those remains a key part of the company's strategy.
