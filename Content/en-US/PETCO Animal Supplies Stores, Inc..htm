   has refocused and reorganized since being taken private. Among its changes, PETCO has boosted its marketing efforts and is investing in its stores and operations. The company has been expanding its retail network through rapid and costly acquisitions. In 2013, PETCO opened its first store in Mexico in partnership with Grupo Gigante there. The joint venture calls for up to 50 PETCO stores in Mexico and Latin America by 2020. It has also updated its aisles with an emphasis on natural and organic products, as well as improved its employee training on pet nutrition and pet care.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In November 2014, PETCO agreed to buy
   <company id="100347">
    Drs. Foster &amp; Smith
   </company>
   , a veterinary-owned online pet product supply company. The purchase, which is expected to close in 2015, gives PETCO one of the nation's largest catalog and online sellers of pet supplies.
  </p>
        <p>
   In June 2011 the company purchased Complete Petmart, a chain of 29 stores in Ohio, Kentucky, North Carolina, and West Virginia.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
        <p>
   PETCO evolved from Upco, a suburban San Diego veterinary supply store opened in 1965. In 1979 it moved into mainstream pet supplies and changed its name to PETCO Animal Supplies. It had 40 stores by 1988, when it was bought by the Spectrum Group and the Thomas H. Lee Company. That year PETCO bought two pet supply chains, more than tripling its store count. Management then began a strategy of having periodic, heavily promoted sales; however, this raised advertising costs and made customer traffic irregular. By 1990 PETCO was in trouble.
  </p>
        <p>
   The chain installed a new management team headed by then CEO Brian Devine. It launched an everyday-low-pricing strategy for its popular premium pet food lines that increased traffic and resulted in more impulse purchases of toys and grooming supplies. Sales stabilized, and by the time PETCO went public in 1994, it had 198 stores. Over the next five years, the firm made 19 acquisitions, adding 208 stores in 28 states. Yet integration of new stores proved costly and competition had heated up. Merger and acquisition costs contributed to losses in 1997-98.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1998 PETCO harnessed its acquisitive pace, adding only four stores. Still, 1999 profits were again affected by merger costs relating to purchases made in 1997. In 1999 PETCO took a 26% interest in e-commerce firm Petopia.com, looking to mark its territory in the already dog-eat-dog online pet-supply market.
  </p>
        <p>
   A poor stock showing led the company to accept a 2000 buyout offer from Leonard Green &amp; Partners and Texas Pacific Group. The acquisition was completed for nearly $600 million. Late that year the company bought the 74% it didn't already own in Petopia.com and subsequently merged it with existing PETCO online operations.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company went public in February 2002. In November, PETCO was named in a lawsuit filed by the San Francisco city attorney's office, alleging that some PETCO employees didn't properly care for pets being sold at the company's two San Francisco stores. The next month Petco settled a California lawsuit that accused the company of improperly denying overtime pay to store managers and assistant store managers.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2003 PETCO spent some $15 million in its stores to supply more boutique pet items, such as designer Michael Simon's fashion petwear, Burberry dog carriers, and $200 cat houses.
  </p>
        <p>
   In March 2004 Brian Devine retired as president and CEO, but remained chairman. EVP and COO Bruce Hall was named president and COO, and EVP and CFO James Myers became CEO.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company went private in 2006 after two buyout firms acquired it.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company was affected in early 2007 by a recall of pet foods made by Menu Foods, a manufacturer whose products contained a wheat gluten that had been contaminated with the chemical melamine. The affected foods were linked to pet illnesses and deaths across the country. PETCO,
   <company id="16273">
    PetSmart
   </company>
   , and other pet retailers, were named in several lawsuits for distributing tainted products.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2010 PETCO acquired four Superpetz pet store locations in South Carolina, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. The acquisition added to PETCO's already expansive footprint.
