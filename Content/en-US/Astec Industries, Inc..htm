   Astec Industries, via its dozen-plus manufacturing subsidiaries, makes equipment for every phase of road building. Its lineup includes aggregate crushers, pavers, asphalt plants, and related components. The company is comprised of three segments: road building and related equipment (Infrastructure Group); aggregate processing and mining equipment (Aggregate and Mining Group); and equipment for the extraction and production of fuels, biomass production, and water drilling (Energy Group). Customers are asphalt road contractors as well as utility and pipeline service providers, government agencies, and mine and quarry operators.

  <p>
   Astec's revenues peaked at a record-setting $983 million in 2015 mainly due to an 11% spike in Infrastructure Group sales. This was fueled by an increase in parts sales due to customers' decisions to repair existing equipment instead of purchasing new equipment throughout the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's profits dropped by 5% to $33 million in 2015 mainly due to increases in payroll, repairs and maintenance, and computer expenses. Cash flow from operations surged by 64% in 2015, primarily due to changes in inventories, and trade and other receivables.

  <p>
   Acquisitions and divestitures have helped to diversify the company's customer base and drive recovery in strategic markets. In mid-2016, Astec acquired Power Flame, based in Parsons, Kansas, for $43 million. Power Flame manufactures gas, oil and combination gas/oil burners and combustion control systems designed for commercial, industrial, and process applications.
