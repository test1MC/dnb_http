   ASM International (ASMI -- the ASM stands for Advanced Semiconductor Materials) burns the chip candle at both ends. Operating in more than 14 countries, ASMI makes equipment for front-end chip-making processes, such as epitaxy (film deposition), diffusion/oxidation, and chemical vapor deposition. Through a majority stake in Hong Kong-based
   <company id="145746">
    ASM Pacific Technology
   </company>
   , ASMI also makes back-end production machinery used in semiconductor assembly, packaging, and testing. The company sells to top semiconductor manufacturers, such as
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="14116">
    Micron Technology
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="118756">
    Toshiba Semiconductor
   </company>
   , and to silicon foundries, such as
   <company id="43493">
    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
   </company>
   . More than half of sales come from Asia/Pacific customers.

   Netherlands native Arthur del Prado founded Advanced Semiconductor Materials International (ASMI) in 1968. The company originally concentrated on front-end chip production processes, but in 1975 it entered the market for back-end chip manufacturing equipment when it formed ASM Pacific Technology in Hong Kong. ASMI expanded into the US in 1976.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company went public in 1981 and that year acquired Elmont International, a developer of pattern recognition systems used in automated die inspection. The next year ASMI added facilities in Japan. In 1984 the company teamed up with Philips &amp; Co. (now
   <company id="41823">
    Philips Electronics
   </company>
   ) to form joint venture ASM Lithography Holding. (That company was renamed
   <company id="47993">
    ASML Holding
   </company>
   in 2001.) Two years later ASMI formed ASM Ion Implant with several veterans of Eaton's and Varian Associates' ion implant operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1988, in an effort to cut back on development investments, the company sold its 50% stake in ASML to Philips and its minority stake in ASM Ion Implant to Varian Associates. That year it also sold 25% of ASM Pacific Technology on the Hong Kong stock exchange to underwrite Asian expansion.
  </p>
  <p>
   ASMI and AT&amp;T's
   <company id="107464">
    Bell Labs
   </company>
   (now part of
   <company id="41751">
    Alcatel-Lucent
   </company>
   ) began to develop aluminum vapor deposition technology during the early 1990s. In 1993, with the semiconductor industry going into one of its periodic slumps, ASMI sold its ASM Fico Tooling subsidiary (molding and trim-and-form systems).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company changed its name to ASM International in 1996. The next year it agreed to pay $80 million to
   <company id="12647">
    Applied Materials
   </company>
   to settle a long-running patent-infringement suit.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 ASMI acquired Microchemistry, a top developer of atomic layer chemical vapor deposition equipment, from
   <company id="60992">
    Fortum Corp.
   </company>
   of Finland. The company also bought 24% of NanoPhotonics, a German maker of precision thin-film metrology equipment. In 2000 ASMI raised its stake in ASM Pacific Technology to 55%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 a worldwide slump in the semiconductor industry led ASMI to cut its staff by about 15%. That year, the company bought a small stake in NuTool, a California-based maker of specialized deposition equipment; ASMI increased its NuTool stake in 2003. In 2004 ASMI bought the rest of NuTool, as well as Genitech, another maker of specialized deposition systems. Also that year the company established a wafer processing equipment plant in Singapore as part of its strategy to strengthen its presence in Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company initiated an intellectual property licensing program, seeking to license its technology in non-competitive areas. Restructuring its front-end equipment operations, ASMI sold the NuTool intellectual property portfolio in 2006 for â‚¬11 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company's boards designated Chuck del Prado, president and GM of ASM America, as the CEO of ASMI effective in 2008. Chuck del Prado, the son of founder Arthur del Prado, was with ASMI since 2001, having earlier held management positions at ASM Lithography and IBM Nederland. Arthur del Prado became a senior advisor to the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   After increasing its equity interest in NanoPhotonics to nearly 73%, ASMI sold its majority ownership of the firm to an Austrian firm, Ricmar Beteiligungs GmbH, in 2008 as it continued to focus on its core wafer processing equipment portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under pressure from some leading shareholders to sell or spin off its unprofitable front-end semiconductor equipment lines, ASMI in 2008 received an unsolicited offer from
   <company id="12647">
    Applied Materials
   </company>
   to buy the company's atomic layer deposition and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition product lines. Applied indicated it was willing to pay $400 million to $500 million for those product lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   After considering the offer, ASMI officially responded that it was not interested in selling the two product lines to Applied, but said it was willing to discuss "any alternative arrangements" between the companies that would benefit ASMI and its stakeholders.
  </p>
  <p>
   Applied then made a combined offer with
   <company id="128276">
    Francisco Partners
   </company>
   to buy all of ASMI's front-end equipment lines for up to $800 million. Applied would get the deposition equipment lines it sought, while Francisco would acquire ASMI's remaining front-end activities, including epitaxial reactors and vertical furnaces. ASMI rejected that offer, as well, saying it was not in the best interest of its shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2008, after more than four months lacking any progress between the parties, Applied and Francisco notified ASMI that they were no longer pursuing the offer. The turnabout came just after Applied reported significantly lower sales and profits in its fourth quarter and began cutting its workforce by 12% in light of dramatically bearish conditions in the worldwide semiconductor equipment market.
