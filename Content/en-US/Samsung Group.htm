   Samsung Group has reason to sing. The
   <em>
    chaebol
   </em>
   (family-controlled conglomerate) is the #1 business group in South Korea, ahead of former #1 and archrival, the erstwhile Hyundai Group. Samsung's flagship unit is

   , which is one of the world's top makers of DRAMs and other memory chips, as well as a global heavyweight in all sorts of electronic gear, including LCD panels, DVD players, and wireless phones. Other affiliated companies include credit-card unit Samsung Card,

   In 1936 Japan-educated Lee Byung-Chull began operating a rice mill in Korea, then under Japanese rule. By 1938 Lee had begun trading in dried fish and had incorporated as Samsung (Korean for "three stars"). WWII left Korea fairly unscathed, and by war's end Samsung had transportation and real estate adjuncts.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Korean War, however, destroyed nearly all of Samsung's assets. Left with a brewery and an import business for
   <company id="114849">
    UN
   </company>
   personnel, Lee reconstructed Samsung in South Korea. He formed the highly profitable Cheil Sugar Company, then the country's only sugar refiner, in 1953. Textile, banking, and insurance ventures followed.
  </p>
  <p>
   A 1961 political coup brought Park Chung-Hee to power in South Korea. Lee, wealthy and tied to the former government, was accused of illegal profiteering. A 1966 smuggling case involving one of Lee's sons led to another scandal, but charges were dropped when Lee gave the government an immense fertilizer plant. Despite the political change, Samsung still grew, diversifying into paper products, department stores, and publishing.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1969, with help from
   <company id="41882">
    SANYO
   </company>
   , Lee established
   <company id="55277">
    Samsung Electronics
   </company>
   , which benefited from the government's export drive and low wage rates. By disassembling Western-designed electronics, Samsung Electronics figured out how to produce inexpensive black-and-white televisions and, later, color TVs, VCRs, and microwave ovens. It manufactured these products under private labels for corporations including
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11338">
    Sears
   </company>
   . In concert with the government's industrialization push, the
   <i>
    chaebol
   </i>
   also began making ships (1974), petrochemicals (1977), and aircraft engines (1977). By the 1980s Samsung was exporting electronics under its own name.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Lee died in 1987, his son Lee Kun-Hee assumed control. After years of importing technology and spending freely on R&amp;D, in 1990 Samsung became a world leader in chip production. Encouraged by the government, Samsung agreed to cooperate with fellow
   <i>
    chaebol
   </i>
   Goldstar (now
   <company id="41185">
    LG Group
   </company>
   ) to obtain foreign technology to develop LCDs. In 1994 Lee, a longtime car lover, announced plans to form Samsung Motors.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 Lee was caught in a corruption scandal and got a two-year suspended sentence for bribery. The next year Asian financial markets crashed. Nonetheless, Samsung bought the remaining 50.1% of struggling PC maker
   <company id="12500">
    AST
   </company>
   (it had bought a 49.9% share in 1996) but exited the US consumer PC market. Even as the bottom fell out of the Korean auto market, Samsung Motors began delivering its first cars in 1998. To lessen its debt, the group sold Samsung Heavy Industries' construction equipment business to Sweden's
   <company id="41854">
    Volvo
   </company>
   and sold Samsung Electronics' power device unit to
   <company id="53008">
    Fairchild Semiconductor
   </company>
   . Also in 1998 the South Korean government fined several
   <i>
    chaebol
   </i>
   , including Samsung, a collective $93 million for illegally funneling money to weaker subsidiaries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Samsung sold the ailing AST to Beny Alagem, former head of Packard Bell NEC, in 1999. The following year Samsung sold a 70% stake in the struggling Samsung Motors to France-based
   <company id="41191">
    Renault
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The early 21st century saw the group surge as its flagship unit Samsung Electronics racked up big wins in semiconductors, cell phones, high-end televisions, and other consumer electronics.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to tap demand from the world's seventh-largest economy, Samsung Group set up a wholly owned insurance firm in China in 2005. Based in Shanghai, Samsung Fire &amp; Marine Insurance (China) opened its doors with a $24 million investment to help kickstart business. Samsung Techwin, the group's digital camera unit, entered a joint development agreement with
   <company id="58418">
    Pentax Corporation
   </company>
   that year to manufacture digital single-lens reflex cameras.
  </p>
  <p>
   News surfaced in 2005 that Samsung Group had attempted to acquire Kia Motors in 1997. Conversations between a Samsung official and the former head of a daily newspaper were allegedly intercepted and recorded by the country's National Intelligence Service. The group apologized over the conversation, which also allegedly centered on illegal political donations during the 1997 presidential election. Prosecutors exploring the allegations considered calling Lee in for questioning.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, Lee arrived in the US in 2005 to reportedly receive medical treatment; he underwent lung cancer treatment in Houston in 2000. That didn't stop the Korean National Assembly's finance and economy committee from summoning Lee to question him over unpaid debts left by the group's bankrupt Samsung Motors (Lee subsequently didn't appear). Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun simultaneously blasted Lee and the group, saying it sought to sidestep corporate governance reform. Led by main creditor Seoul Guarantee Insurance, 15 creditors planned to push ahead with a lawsuit over the unpaid debts -- potentially the country's biggest lawsuit in financial terms.
  </p>
  <p>
   Two executives -- Her Tae-Hak, former chief of Samsung Everland, and Park Ro-Bin, the president and CEO of Samsung Everland -- were sentenced to prison in 2005 on charges of helping Lee transfer wealth to his son in illicit bond deals a decade earlier; their sentences were suspended, however. That month the Korean Supreme Court ordered Lee and nine former and current Samsung Electronics executives to pay $18.7 million (19 billion won) for instigating heavy losses to the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The group broke ground on its largest overseas facility yet in 2006 -- a mobile phone production and research base in Tianjin, China. Samsung Telecom Technology boosted its investment in the base from $29 million to $197 million, with plans for a production capacity of 17.7 million mobile phone sets upon completion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the group bought back a 47% stake in Samsung Petrochemical from
   <company id="58872">
    BP
   </company>
   , ending a 30-year partnership with the European energy giant. Samsung paid about $70 million to regain majority control of the loss-ridden company; other Samsung affiliates owned about 34% of Samsung Petrochemical, which posted an operating loss of nearly $107 million on sales of $1.5 billion in 2006. Samsung Petrochemical was separate from
   <company id="140139">
    Samsung Total Petrochemicals
   </company>
   , a joint venture formerly known as Samsung General Chemicals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lee Kun-Hee resigned from his management positions with the Samsung Group in 2008 after an official government inquiry into bribery and tax evasion charges. Lee wasn't indicted on any bribery charges, but he was convicted of tax evasion. His son and heir apparent, Lee Jae-Yong, transferred to China from South Korea -- to hone his management skills, in the official version, and to escape the spotlight of the South Korean media, in unofficial reports.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lee Kun-Hee was pardoned in 2009 by the president of South Korea. The following year, top Samsung executives prevailed upon him to return to the conglomerate as chairman of Samsung Electronics.
