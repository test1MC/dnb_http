   Making plastic cling is this company's thing. AEP Industries manufactures plastic packaging films -- more than 15,000 types -- including stretch wrap for industrial pallets, packaging for foods and beverages, and films for agricultural uses, such as wrap for hay bales. AEP also makes dispenser-boxed plastic wraps, which are sold to consumers as well as institutions ranging from schools to hospitals. Other industries courted by AEP are packaging, transportation, food, autos, chemicals, textiles, and electronics. The company operates in the US and in Canada. In the summer of 2016, AEP agreed to be acquired by rival

   AEP agreed to be acquired by
   <company id="58196">
    Berry Plastics Group
   </company>
   in mid-2016 in a deal valued at $765 million, a price that includes AEP's debt load. AEP will be combined with Berry's Engineered Materials Division.

  <p>
   AEP conducts about 95% of its business in the US market. Remaining sales take place in Canada. It has about 15 manufacturing facilities in the US (about 11 states) and Canada. The company also exports its products to Latin America through its office in Waxahachie, Texas.

  <p>
   About two-thirds of AEP's sales are made to distributors, and the remainder, directly to end-users of its products. It serves about 3,000 customers. The company works to maintain customer relationships, and it provides technical training to its sales personal so that they are able to provide customer support and communicate customer needs to the company's product development team. Distribution functions are mostly contracted to third parties.

  <p>
   AEP's revenues have fluctuated over the years. After peaking at $1.19 billion in 2014, revenues fell by 4% to $1.14 billion in 2015. The revenue decrease for 2015 was fueled by a 3% dip in average selling prices, primarily due to the pass-through of lower resin costs negatively affecting net sales by $31 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company in 2015 also experienced a 1% decrease in sales volumes attributed to volatility in the resin markets. This resulted in soft customer demand in certain stock product lines, customer bankruptcies, and the impact of exiting certain low-margin businesses during fiscal 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   After experiencing a net loss of $6 million in 2014, AEP posted positive net income of $29 million in 2015. This was the result of a decline in costs coupled with a larger amount of income tax benefits.

  <p>
   With little product differentiation among plastic film producers, AEP positions itself as the low-cost source, with technological expertise to customize value-added flexible films to satisfy myriad manufacturing and processing applications. The company aims to provide long-term value to shareholders by becoming the preferred provider of flexible packaging products in the North American market.
  </p>
  <p>
   To strengthen its finances and increase manufacturing output and productivity, AEP is investing heavily in capital improvements. During the last decade it has purchased or leased new equipment and made equipment upgrades intended to optimize its manufacturing footprint in high-growth product categories.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company looks for success in its sales and distribution model by establishing long-term relationships with its customers. To mitigate the volatility of raw material prices, the company pursues volume raw material rebates by making most of its purchases from three primary suppliers.

  <p>
   Brendan Barba, a former salesman for polyethylene film maker PPD, formed Flexible Plastics in 1967 in Lodi, New Jersey. In 1970 his partner bought him out. That year Barba founded AEP Industries, briefly called Automatically Extruded Products. In 1982 the company moved into the specialty and premium films market. It established a plant in Waxahachie, Texas, in 1985, and went public a year later.
