   One of the largest auto parts makers in the US, Visteon Corporation operates across one chief business group: Electronic Products (audio systems, driver control systems, infotainment systems, powertrain and feature control modules).
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   represents nearly 35% of sales; Visteon also provides products and services to aftermarket customers. The company has 50 manufacturing, engineering and customer support facilities in nearly 20 countries. More than 70% of its sales are made outside the US.
  </p>

  <p>
   Visteon in 2015 restructured into one chief segment: Electronic Products (95% of net sales) offers audio systems, driver control systems, and powertrain and feature control modules. In 2015 it sold its former Climate Control segment, which sold climate systems and powertrain cooling systems.

  <p>
   Ford, Mazda, and Nissan/Renault are the company's largest customers and in 2015 accounted for sales of approximately 34%, 16%, and 14%, respectively.

  <p>
   The company suffered a major drop in revenue in 2015 primarily as a result of the divestiture of its Climate Controls and Interiors operations (67% of net sales in 2014). Visteon's net income surged in 2015, however, mainly due to additional income from its former Climate Controls segment and a gain on sale of non-consolidated affiliates of $62 million. (Note: the company's 2014 annual report was restated as a result of this major restructuring.)

  <p>
   Visteon has been reorganizing and getting rid of extraneous divisions and units in order to focus on its more profitable operations. As part of a strategic reorganization, Visteon in 2014 divested all of its global Interiors business to Reydel Automotive Holdings B.V., an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. and also completed the sale of interiors operations in India and Thailand.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company completed the sale of its former Climate Controls segment for approximately $3.4 billion. In the same year, its Visteon Deutschland GmbH subsidiary completed the sale to APCH Automotive Plastic Components Holding GmbH.

  <p>
   Visteon also uses acquisitions as a means for fortifying its core operations. In mid-2014 it paid $265 million to purchase the automotive electronics business of
   <company id="10825">
    Johnson Controls
   </company>
   . The deal gave Visteon seven research and development centers in Europe, North America, and Asia and further diversified and expanded its global customer base.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding its thermal energy management product portfolio, in 2014, through its subsidiary, the company acquired the automotive thermal and emissions business of Cooper-Standard Automotive (a subsidiary of
   <company id="103931">
    Cooper-Standard Holdings
   </company>
   ) for $46 million.
