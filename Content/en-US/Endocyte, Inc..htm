   Endocyte develops receptor-targeted therapeutics (or "smart drugs") that aim to take out bad cells without causing collateral damage. Receptor-targeted therapeutics are a precision alternative to non-targeted cancer drugs that can destroy healthy cells. Founded in 1996, Endocyte uses its drug guidance system to deliver drugs including small molecule cancer drugs and RNA-based therapies directly to cancerous cells, while leaving other cells unaffected. The firm has a pipeline of small molecule drug conjugates (SMDCs) in various stages of development. Its lead candidate, Vynfinit (vintafolide), is designed to treat ovarian cancer.

  <p>
   Other drugs in Endocyte's pipeline are being tested for use in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer, polycystic kidney disease, and inflammatory diseases.

   The company plans to build a sales and marketing team once its product candidates are ready for commercialization. It is also open to working with sales and distribution partners to market its drugs.

  <p>
   Endocyte has no commercial products and has therefore not received any product sales revenue. After years of net sales gains from a partnership collaboration with
   <company id="11326">
    Merck
   </company>
   , the company saw a drop in sales to $70,000 in 2015 (versus $70.4 million in 2014). Endocyte and Merck terminated their collaboration in 2014, leaving Endocyte with global rights to Vynfinit.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the drop in revenue, the company incurred a net loss of $41.3 billion (versus $5.4 billion in net income in 2014). The decline was partially offset by a drop in R&amp;D expenses as certain trials for Vynfinit were completed and employee compensation charges went down. Also that year, Endocyte had an operating cash outflow of $32.2 million, an improvement over 2014's outflow of $42.2 million. This was largely due to changes in deferred revenue and accounts payable.

  <p>
   Endocyte is focused on the development and commercialization of novel SMDCs for the treatment of various cancers and inflammatory diseases. It intends to further build its pipeline using its proprietary technology, as well as develop companion imaging agents for each of its SMDCs, allowing treatments to be personalized for each patient. Among its key goals is to study EC1169 for the treatment of prostate cancer.
