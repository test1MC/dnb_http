   Yield10 Bioscience (formerly Metabolix) is an agricultural bioscience company focused on developing disruptive technologies to improve crop yield for food and feed crops in order to enhance global food security. Yield10 is targeting new agricultural biotechnology approaches to improve fundamental elements of plant metabolism through enhanced photosynthetic efficiency and directed carbon utilization. In particular, Yield10 is working to develop, validate, and commercialize new traits and identify gene editing targets in canola, soybean, corn, and other key crops. Yield10 was launched in 2015. In 2016 Metabolix sold its biopolymer intellectual property (the company's former key asset) for $10 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The JV partners constructed a manufacturing facility in Iowa, which has an annual production capacity of 110 million pounds of PHA, and sold PHA-based bioplastics in the US, Europe, and other countries. ADM is retaining the manufacturing plant, but all the technology used in the joint venture will revert to Metabolix.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the exit of ADM, Metabolix plans to restructure its bioplastics operations and is conducting a review of business priorities. It intends to keep developing renewable industrial chemicals and is in ongoing discussions with possible new partners about the commercialization of PHA biopolymers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 it granted a patent license to
   <company id="105194">
    NatureWorks
   </company>
   to sell blends of polylactic acid (PLA) with certain other polymers, along with NatureWorks' partner
   <company id="162586">
    BioAmber
   </company>
   . Metabolix sees the arrangement as a way to introduce its biopolymer blends and new materials to the marketplace.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mirel eventually will be used, Metabolix hopes, in just about anything that currently uses traditional plastics. The company foresees its use in disposable dinnerware and utensils, packaging products for foods and beverages, personal hygiene products, and degradable mulching films and plant pots, as well as in electronics products such as cell phone casings.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's revenues plummeted some 69% in 2010 due to a significant drop in grant funding for research and development. Net income remained a loss, though only slightly lower than 2009. The company is optimistic that sales will rise significantly by 2013 and beyond as more of its products reach commercialization and it begins to receive royalties and payments on previously deferred revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Commercialization came a step closer in 2011 when UCAN Products selected Mirel for a new line of kitchen compost bags. UCAN is the first distributor to offer Mirel-based compost bags for consumer purchase. The company said it chose Mirel for its durability and faster breakdown in industrial composting facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company also made progress in demonstrating production of C4 and C3 chemicals and in advancing co-production of biobased chemicals in switchgrass. Metabolix had received a
   <company id="127256">
    National Institute of Standards and Technology
   </company>
   grant in 2009 aimed at producing four-carbon (C4) chemicals from renewable sources. C4 belongs to a large family of chemicals with a wide range of applications, including engineering resins, urethanes, solvents, and personal care products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company formed an alliance in 2011 with Korean bioscience company CJ CheilJedang (CJ) to jointly develop its production technology and commercialization plans for renewable C4 chemicals via fermentation. Metabolix would contribute its expertise in microbial strains and its process for developing high-purity C4 chemicals, while CJ would offer its expertise in bio-fermentation and manufacturing. That year the company also produced gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), which it plans to make its initial market entry. Subsequent entries incude butanediol (BD)), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and polyester engineering resins (PBT).

   Metabolix was founded in 1992. The company's various investors -- which included
   <company id="10124">
    Archer-Daniels Midland
   </company>
   (ADM) and venture capital firm the Vertical Group -- took the company public in 2006, taking advantage of an investment community eager to jump on any company making a product that formerly required the use of crude oil but no longer does. The company funneled proceeds received from the public offering into its own operations -- funding equipment for a pilot plant, a switchgrass biomass refinery, research and development, new personnel, and other expenses.
