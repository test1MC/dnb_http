  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates through six main business segments: Match Group, HomeAdvisor, Publishing, Applications, Video, and Other.
  </p>
  <p>
   Match Group (32% of IAC's total revenue in 2015) includes the dating and non-dating businesses. Match Group operates a dating business that consists of a portfolio with more than 45 brands (available in 38 languages). Brands include Match, OkCupid, PlentyOfFish, Tinder, Meetic, Twoo, OurTime, BlackPeopleMeet and FriendScout24. It also operates a non-dating business through Match Group's ownership of
   <company id="43024">
    The Princeton Review
   </company>
   , which provides a variety of educational test preparation, academic tutoring and college counseling services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Applications (24%) consists of Consumer (direct-to-consumer downloadable desktop applications, including SlimWare, and Apalon, which houses mobile applications); and Partnerships (business-to-business partnership operations). Applications businesses provide search services and a variety of utility applications to users.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="99515">
    HomeAdvisor
   </company>
   (10%) provides home services digital marketplace that helps connect consumers with home professionals across the US, as well as in France and the Netherlands, under various brands. HomeAdvisor connects consumers, by way of proprietary and patented technologies, with home services professionals, most of whom are pre-screened and customer rated.
  </p>
  <p>
   Video (7%) consists primarily of Vimeo and DailyBurn, as well as Electus, IAC Films, CollegeHumor, and Notional.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other (6%) consists of
   <company id="160401">
    ShoeBuy.com
   </company>
   , an Internet retailer of footwear and related apparel and accessories, and PriceRunner, a shopping comparison website.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Focused in the areas of search, applications, online dating, local and media, IAC's family of websites is one of the largest in the world, with more than a billion monthly visits across more than 30 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   IAC has operations in North America, Europe, Latin America, Australia, and Asia. The US accounted for 74% of total revenue in 2015.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company markets its services through a wide variety of activities including traditional marketing, television advertising, print advertising, and radio advertising, public relations, and e-mail campaigns. It spent about $1.2 billion on advertising and marketing promotions during fiscal 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   A significant component of the company's revenue is attributable to a services agreement with
   <company id="59101">
    Google
   </company>
   . In fiscal 2015 IAC earned revenue of about $1.3 billion from Google.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has recorded an increasing trend in net revenues over the last five years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2015, net revenue was $3.23 billion, up by 4% compared to 2014 due to sales increases in all the company's segments except for Publishing and Applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Match Group revenue increased driven by higher Dating revenue attributable to growth in Direct revenue. Direct revenue growth was primarily driven by higher average paid member count in both North America and International results, due mainly to Tinder, partially offset by lower average revenue per paying user due to brand mix shifts and foreign exchange effects. Non-dating revenue increased due to the full year contribution from The Princeton Review, which was acquired in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   HomeAdvisor revenue rose due to growth of HomeAdvisor's US business, partially offset by international declines due primarily to the restructuring of certain European operations in 2014. HomeAdvisor domestic revenue growth was driven by higher service requests and an increase in paying service professionals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Publishing revenue decreased due to lower Ask &amp; Other revenue, partially offset by higher Premium Brands revenue. Ask &amp; other revenue decreased primarily to a drop in revenue from Ask.com and certain legacy businesses. Premium Brands revenue increased due primarily to strong growth at About.com and Investopedia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Applications revenue decreased due to a decline in Partnerships, partially offset by Consumer growth driven by higher revenue from downloadable desktop applications (including SlimWare) and a full year contribution from the Apalon mobile applications business, which was acquired in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Video revenue grew due primarily to strong growth from Vimeo, DailyBurn, and Electus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other revenue decreased due to lower revenue from PriceRunner.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2015, IAC's net income of $119.47 million was down 71% compared to 2014. This decrease was due to an increase of $82 million in amortization of intangibles (related to certain trade names of certain Ask &amp; Other direct marketing brands, including Ask.com); $45.8 million in stock-based compensation expense; and $14.1 million in goodwill impairment. This was partially offset by an increase in gains of $2.1 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments and a decrease in earnings from discontinued operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities was $349.4 million, down 18%, due to the changes in income taxes payable, accounts receivable, and other assets.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 the company extended its service agreement with Google. IAC plans to continue to introduce new and enhanced content, products and services in response to evolving trends and technologies. It has also introduced technologies that can block the display of online advertisements across platforms (particularly and increasingly in the case with mobile platforms) and that provide users with the ability to opt out of advertising products. HomeAdvisor partnered with Google to allow homeowners to book appointments with home service professionals through Google search results.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it opened offices in Indianapolis and Downtown Denver.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition IAC has been expanding its business and brands portfolio through acquisitions.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015, the company acquired Plentyoffish Media, a leading provider of subscription-based and ad-supported online personals servicing North America, Europe, Latin America and Australia, for $575 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year IAC made a bid to acquire
   <company id="107005">
    Angie's List
   </company>
   which was rejected.

  <p>
   TV networks aren't built in a day; but if anyone could do it, it's probably Barry Diller. Since dropping out of
   <company id="40486">
    UCLA
   </company>
   in 1958 to work in the mailroom at the
   <company id="44345">
    William Morris
   </company>
   talent agency (he was promoted to agent in 1961), Diller has been all over Tinseltown. He got into television in 1968 as the VP of programming for
   <company id="10290">
    ABC
   </company>
   , where he developed the concepts of the miniseries and the made-for-TV movie. Diller's next step took him into movies as chairman of
   <company id="103362">
    Paramount Pictures
   </company>
   in 1974. His 10-year Paramount stint produced films including
   <i>
    Raiders of the Lost Ark.
   </i>
   But Diller's biggest claim to fame is his tenure at
   <company id="103359">
    FOX
   </company>
   . Beginning in 1984, Diller led the brash television network from joke to jewel. After a scrape with FOX boss Rupert Murdoch in 1992, he moved on to home shopping as head of
   <company id="57399">
    QVC
   </company>
   in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   Diller built a company of his own in 1995 after leaving QVC. With financial backing from TCI (later bought by AT&amp;T Broadband), Diller took over the Home Shopping Network (now
   <company id="12024">
    HSN
   </company>
   ) and its separately traded distribution unit, Silver King Communications. Silver King merged with Savoy Pictures and Home Shopping Network in 1996, calling the new company HSN. In 1997 HSN bought Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's 47% interest in Ticketmaster. Diller followed that up with the $4 billion purchase of USA Networks in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   USA Networks dates back to 1977, when Kay Koplovitz founded the all-sports Madison Square Garden Network cable channel. In 1980, after shifting its focus from sports to syndicated TV shows and feature films, she sold the channel (now USA Network) to Time, MCA, and Paramount. After years of reruns, USA began developing original programming in 1988. By that time Paramount (later bought by
   <company id="12435">
    Viacom
   </company>
   ) and MCA (later bought by Seagram and renamed Universal Studios) had become equal owners in USA. After a bitter courtroom struggle in which Universal accused Viacom of running its
   <company id="101156">
    MTV
   </company>
   and
   <company id="117074">
    Nickelodeon
   </company>
   networks in competition with USA, Universal bought out Viacom's interest in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   Diller bought USA Networks (USA Network and the SCI-FI Channel) and Vivendi UNIVERSAL Entertainment's TV production and US distribution business as well. The deal gave Seagram a 45% stake in HSN, which changed its name to USA Networks. USA Networks bought the remainder of Ticketmaster in 1998, then purchased online entertainment guide publisher
   <company id="51052">
    Citysearch
   </company>
   , merging it with Ticketmaster Online into a new company called Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch. USA Networks then spun off the new company to the public, retaining a 60% interest (later reduced to about 50%).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Diller failed in an attempt to merge Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch and Internet portal Lycos (now part of
   <company id="99045">
    Terra Networks
   </company>
   ). Diller then bought parts of
   <company id="91337">
    PolyGram Filmed Entertainment
   </company>
   and independent film companies Gramercy and October from Seagram, renaming them Focus. USA Networks also bought the Hotel Reservations Network in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company reorganized into three units: USA Electronic Retailing, USA Entertainment, and USA Information and Services. It also lost
   <company id="47854">
    World Wrestling Federation
   </company>
   programming to Viacom. Later that year French utility and media firm Vivendi (now Vivendi UNIVERSAL) bought Seagram, gaining Seagram's 43% stake in USA Networks.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Ticketmaster Online bought its former parent
   <company id="47478">
    Ticketmaster Corporation
   </company>
   . USA Networks retained 68% of the combined company. USA Networks also agreed to sell its TV stations to Univision for $1.1 billion. Diller later announced that his company would buy a 65% stake in Expedia (completed 2002) and launch a travel venture called USA Travel Group. The group eventually included Hotels.com, a cable travel channel, and USA's minority stake in cruise and vacation package provider National Leisure Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the end of 2001, Diller decided to shift USA Interactive's focus entirely to retailing. He agreed to sell USA Networks' entertainment assets to Vivendi UNIVERSAL for $10.3 billion. The deal was completed in 2002, and the company changed its name to USA Interactive with Diller retaining his voting control of the firm.
  </p>
  <p>
   2003 was a busy year for USA Interactive. It bought the remaining 33% stake in Ticketmaster that it didn't already own, making it a wholly owned subsidiary. Later that year the company completed its acquisition of the outstanding shares of Hotels.com and Expedia that it didn't already own, making them both wholly owned subsidiaries. The same day of the Expedia deal, IAC completed its acquisition of online financial services company LendingTree (now
   <company id="99287">
    Tree.com
   </company>
   ), branching IAC out into the online financial services market. Also in 2003 IAC acquired discount travel Web site
   <company id="105879">
    hotwire.com
   </company>
   for $666.7 million. The same year USA Interactive bought back over $400 million of its own shares from Vivendi Universal and changed its name to InterActiveCorp (IAC).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004, in a move to round out its travel-related entities, IAC acquired
   <company id="106407">
    TripAdvisor
   </company>
   ; over the course of the year, IAC also purchased a total of 52% of Beijing-based travel site
   <company id="136169">
    eLong
   </company>
   . It also deepened its people-connector segment with the purchase of
   <company id="132359">
    Friendfinder
   </company>
   rival
   <company id="118118">
    ZeroDegrees
   </company>
   (as in "zero degrees of separation"). Also in 2004, IAC acquired the unique homeowner services connector
   <company id="99515">
    ServiceMagic
   </company>
   . During the same buying spree, it also acquired British online personals service uDate.com, a rival to its
   <company id="107288">
    Match.com
   </company>
   , for $150 million in stock. Also that year the company changed its name to IAC/InterActiveCorp.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 IAC launched Gifts.com, a gift-shopping website. In April the company completed the acquisition of
   <company id="58159">
    Cornerstone Brands
   </company>
   , a portfolio of leading print catalogs and online retailing sites for $720 million. In mid-2005 IAC sold its 48% interest in German TV operator Euvia Media for about $80 million and its stake in Vivendi Universal Entertainment for $322.1 million. Later that year IAC completed the spinoff to IAC shareholders of its travel businesses, which included its Expedia subsidiary, as well as Hotels.com, Hotwire, and TripAdvisor. Shareholders received one share of Expedia common stock and one share of IAC common stock for every two shares of IAC common held.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 IAC renamed Ask Jeeves
   <company id="59572">
    Ask.com
   </company>
   in conjunction with a major advertising campaign designed to capture users of Google and Yahoo. It later purchased a 51% stake in
   <company id="148343">
    Connected Ventures, LLC
   </company>
   , the parent company of CollegeHumor.com. The acquisition was the first  by the new programming division of IAC. Also in 2006 the company sold its teleservices unit
   <company id="51347">
    PRC, LLC
   </company>
   to private equity group Diamond Castle Holdings and PRC management for an undisclosed amount.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 IAC sold its Germany TV and internet retailer, HSE Germany. Also that year gifts.com acquired GiveFun.com, an online provider of gift certificates, and in late 2007 IAC struck a deal with online video syndication firm Brightcove to create and distribute video for IAC's brands. (IAC holds a minority stake in Brightcove.) Also, the company's new corporate headquarters (designed by the architect Frank Gehry) in New York's Chelsea neighborhood was completed in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   IAC split into five public companies in 2008 by spinning off
   <company id="12024">
    HSN
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="58442">
    Ticketmaster
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="99287">
    Tree.com
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="60081">
    ILG
   </company>
   . The company's Web properties remained under the IAC conglomerate. John Malone's Liberty Media had owned a 60% stake in IAC and was against the corporate breakup. Malone eventually dropped his opposition in exchange for a voting agreement with Diller, and Liberty was given the power to appoint board members to the spinoff companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 Match.com sold the European operations of Match.com to online dating site
   <company id="154222">
    Meetic
   </company>
   in exchange for a 27% interest in Meetic and €5 million (about $6.7 million). To expand its ServiceMagic business, IAC acquired MarketHardware, an online provider of marketing solutions for home services businesses, in 2009. Also that year the company sold off nonessential holdings in its Emerging Business segment, which was subsequently renamed Media &amp; Other. (The segment includes all assets not related to Search, Match, and ServiceMagic.) As part of this plan, in 2009 IAC sold campground reservation firm
   <company id="141203">
    ReserveAmerica
   </company>
   to community sports site operator
   <company id="132694">
    The Active Network
   </company>
   . Under the terms of the sale, IAC received a minority stake in The Active Network.
  </p>
  <p>
   Online local city guide Citysearch -- another component of IAC's Search segment -- also underwent a reorganization in 2010, when Citysearch became CityGrid Media. The new name reflects that business's evolution to a local advertising and content network that also houses Urbanspoon (online restaurant guide acquired in 2009) and Insider Pages (consumer reviews of local businesses, purchased in 2007).
  </p>
  <p>
   Later that year Malone and Diller ended their business relationship when IAC bought out its stake in Liberty Media in exhange for $220 million and the Evite and Gifts.com businesses, which became part of Liberty Interactive. Concurrent with the deal, Diller remains chairman but stepped down as CEO. He was replaced by former Match.com CEO Greg Blatt.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year the company's Daily Beast merged with Newsweek to form The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company.
   <em>
    Newsweek
   </em>
   had been losing money, and in 2010 Sidney Harman (founder of
   <company id="10707">
    Harman International Industries
   </company>
   ) purchased the magazine from The Washington Post Company. Harman made the deal to help revitalize the print title, which had been faltering as it tries to remain relevant in the internet era; he served as executive chairman of Newsweek/Daily Beast until his death in 2011. Formerly a joint venture between IAC and Harman, The Newsweek/Deaily Beast Company became majority-controlled by IAC in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 IAC acquired online information portal
   <company id="53065">
    About
   </company>
   from
   <company id="12184">
    The New York Times Company
   </company>
   for some $300 million. Later that year ServiceMagic was renamed HomeAdvisor.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 IAC purchased the online tutoring website Tutor.com.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 HomeAdvisor acquired Werkspot.nl, the Netherlands' leading online platform connecting homeowners with qualified craftsmen.
