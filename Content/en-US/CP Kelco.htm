   Don't worry, teachers: CP Kelco has brought enough gum for the entire class. The company's products, derived from renewable, natural raw materials, include carrageenan, gellan gum, xanthan gum, and microparticulated whey protein. A subsidiary of
   <company id="40244">
    J. M. Huber
   </company>
   , the company manufactures specialty hydrocolloids (which produce gels). The additives are used in food, industrial, personal care, and pharmaceutical products -- everything from jam and ketchup to paint and cosmetics -- to give the desired texture, viscosity, and stability. Other markets include pulp and paper (which uses cellulose derivatives) and oilfield drilling (additives for drilling fluids). CP Kelco operates manufacturing facilities worldwide.

   CP Kelco has facilities and markets in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and North America. It has manufacturing plants and R&amp;D facilities in Brazil, China, Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Philippines, and the US.

   The company's products include Carboxymethyl cellulose, Carrageenan, Gellan gum, Pectin, Xanthan gum, arboxymethyl cellulose, diutan gum and microparticulated whey protein concentrate, as well as other novel biopolymers. The main client for local consumption of the gum is oil giant

   CP Kelco serves customers in a range of industries including Beverage, Food, Household Products, Industrial Applications, Oilfield Drilling, Oral Care, Papermaking, Personal Care, and Pharmaceuticals. To strengthen its distribution base in Asia, in 2012 the company appointed Azelis as exclusive distributor in China for Food, Beverage, Consumer and Industrial application segments.

   Growing its global capacity, and extending a focused effort to meet the fast-growing global food and beverage market demand for pectin, in 2013 CP Kelco began to expand its Brazilian pectin plant by 30%, and its San Diego xanthan gum facility by 40%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013, Basic Chemical Industries Co. signed a deal with CP Kelco to jointly build and operate a xanthan gum facility to in Jubail, Saudi Arabia. The plant will have a production capacity of between 5,000 and 10,000 tons.
  </p>
  <p>
   In response to increased demand for amidated pectin (used in low sugar and sugar-free foods) in 2013, CP Kelco invested $10.7 million to expand its plant in Lille Skensved, Denmark.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 CP Kelco began to expand production at its manufacturing plant in Äänekoski, Finland. Already the world's largest volume producer of purified CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose, aka cellulose gum), the Äänekoski plant will see its capacity grow by up to 25%. The expansion is expected to be completed in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company launched a line of novel functional personal care ingredients based on a nature-based biopolymer originally discovered in fermented soybeans; such as natto which is known in Japan. The AquaMAX™ product line is CP Kelco's entry into the functional skin care ingredient space and represents the company's growing interest in offering highly differentiated ingredients for beauty and personal care applications.

  <p>
   In 2011 it also completed two construction projects at its pectin manufacturing plant in Lille Skensved, Denmark, in 2011 that expanded the plant's capacity to produce LMA (or low methoxyl amidated) pectins. These are used as a gelling and stabilization agent in food, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2011, the company bumped up prices 6% across its product lines to counteract inflation and ensure a steady supply. The company also invested in both debottlenecking projects (or removing processing obstacles) and expanding production capacity to meet global increases in demand as part of its strategy to be a sustainable supplier of specialty hydrocolloids.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2011, the USDA National Organic Program listed the company's Kelcogel gellan gum as an allowable ingredient for use in organic foods.

   From a line of companies dating back to 1883, CP Kelco was formed in 2000 by the combination of
