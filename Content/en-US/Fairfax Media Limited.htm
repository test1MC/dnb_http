   If it's news in Australia, it's fair to say that Fairfax is on top of it. Fairfax Media is a leading newspaper and magazine publisher in Australia and New Zealand, with some 430 titles. Its flagship publications include Melbourne's
   <em>
    The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald
   </em>
   , and the
   <em>
    Sunday News
   </em>
   of New Zealand. The media firm also serves the financial news sector with
   <em>
    The Australian Financial Review
   </em>
   , and it operates a portfolio of regional and community papers. Besides its traditional publishing operations, Fairfax Media operates a number of websites in conjunction with its papers, and it owns about 15 radio stations.

   Based in New South Wales, Fairfax Media maintains publishing operations, websites, and radio stations across Australia and New Zealand.

   Looking to launch an Australian Subscription Video-On-Demand (SVOD) service, Fairfax Media in 2014 formed a joint venture with Nine Entertainment Co. that operates under the StreamCo name. It also partnered with Adzuna, which operates a top international job search engine, to offer a new platform for Australian recruiters and job seekers.

  <p>
   Fairfax Media Limited had its start with one John Fairfax, who ran the Warwickshire, UK-based
   <i>
    Leamington Chronicle.
   </i>
   After the liberal paper was twice sued, Fairfax moved his family in 1838 to Australia, which at the time was an English penal colony. In 1841 he and a partner bought the
   <i>
    Sydney Herald.
   </i>
   By 1853 Fairfax owned all of the paper, which boasted a circulation of more than 4,000. Fairfax's son Charles came on board as a partner and was later joined by sibling James Reading Fairfax (the partnership became known as John Fairfax &amp; Sons). The
   <i>
    Herald
   </i>
   's circulation grew to more than 6,600 in 1856, making it one of the largest papers in the British Empire. Charles died in 1863 and was replaced by brother Edward. John Fairfax died in 1877.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under the leadership of James Reading and general manager Hugh George (a former rival), the
   <i>
    Herald
   </i>
   gained a reputation for reliable, evenhanded reporting. Edward eventually tired of the business and sold his stake to his brother, who brought in sons James Oswald and Geoffrey.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hardships brought on by WWI, combined with the company's growth, led John Fairfax &amp; Sons to be listed as a limited corporation. Skyrocketing newsprint costs during the war resulted in the company's first loss in 1919. By 1926 Warwick Fairfax (son of James Oswald) controlled more than one-third of the company. With the help of managing director Rupert Henderson, the company was able to run at a healthy profit even while WWII raged. Fairfax launched
   <i>
    The Australian Financial Review
   </i>
   (which would become one of its flagship publications) in 1951.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1955 Fairfax bought a TV license for Sydney station ATN7. The expansion into the new medium hurt the company's bottom line; it went public the following year to raise cash. Fairfax acquired a number of publications in the 1960s, including
   <i>
    The Age
   </i>
   , the
   <i>
    Newcastle Sun
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Newcastle Morning Herald,
   </i>
   and the
   <i>
    Canberra Times.
   </i>
   It also took stakes in British TV group ATV and Canberra TV station CTC. Also during the 1960s the company first encountered Rupert Murdoch, who began snapping up rival papers in Sydney. (Murdoch's News Corp. would become one of the world's largest media firms and one of Fairfax's fiercest competitors.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The company launched weekend paper
   <i>
    National Times
   </i>
   in 1971, and five years later the board of directors -- increasingly alienated by Warwick's conservative views -- forced him to resign in favor of his son, James. Fairfax overextended itself in 1979 in an effort to block Murdoch's purchase of a rival publication and was forced to sell much of its TV holdings.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1980s saw consolidation throughout Australia's publishing industry. Financiers such as Alan Bond, Robert Holmes รก Court, and Murdoch looked to buy small companies and consolidate operations. Fairfax, in a complex deal that involved all three of the above, emerged with a Melbourne TV station acquired from Murdoch.
  </p>
  <p>
   Upon Warwick's death in 1987, his son Warwick Jr. -- fearing a takeover bid from Holmes รก Court -- made a surprise play for the company through shell firm Tryart. Warwick Jr. was successful, but the move placed Tryart in debt to the tune of $1.7 billion, forcing the company to sell off several assets. Unable to pay off its debt, the company was ripe for a takeover; Canadian newspaper baron Conrad Black acquired the company in 1992, renamed it John Fairfax Holdings Limited, and listed it on the Australian Stock Exchange. Kerry Packer, one of the richest men in Australia and a longtime Fairfax rival in the Sydney newspaper market, had acquired 15% of Fairfax by 1996. (Packer died in 2005.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Fred Hilmer, a professor at the Australian Graduate School of Management, was appointed CEO of Fairfax. The publisher's bottom line was hurt in 2000 by falling sales during the Olympics and a journalists' strike at
   <i>
    The Age.
   </i>
   Difficult times continued in 2001 as a global advertising slowdown affected the company. That year Packer sold his 15% stake in the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hilmer retired in 2005 and was replaced by David Kirk, formerly CEO of commercial printing firm
   <company id="105678">
    PMP
   </company>
   . Early in 2007 the company renamed itself once again, changing its banner to Fairfax Media. It later acquired rival
   <company id="111657">
    Rural Press
   </company>
   for $2.2 billion. Amid a global economic slowdown, Kirk resigned from the company late in 2008; Brian McCarthy was then named CEO and served for two years before he resigned from the post in late 2010.
