   ACCO Brands solves one of the more common workplace indignities: taking a co-worker's stapler. The company makes and markets a slew of traditional brand name office and computer-related products, including Swingline staplers, Kensington keyboards, Wilson Jones binders and ledger paper, and Day-Timer personal organizers, and more. It also offers private-label supplies. ACCO sells mostly to businesses through retail superstores, mass merchandisers, commercial stationers, wholesalers, mail order and internet catalogs, and club stores and dealers. In 2012, ACCO merged with the Consumer &amp; Office Products business spun off by
   <company id="105577">
    MeadWestvaco
   </company>
   .

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The US is ACCO's largest market, accounting for more than 50% of sales. Canada is next with nearly 10%. Australia, Brazil, and the UK are also important markets for the school and office supplies company.

        <p>
   The company operates three business segments: ACCO Brands North America is the largest, representing nearly 60% of sales; ACCO Brands International accounts for about 30%. Both offer office, school, and calendar products under such brands as AT-A-GLANCE, Day-Timer, Five Star, Mead, Swingline, Wilson Jones, and many others. The firm's Computer Products Group (CPG) sells accessories for laptop and desktop computers, tablets, and smartphone mostly under the Kensington, Microsaver, and ClickSafe names. The CPG represents about 10% of ACCO's overall sales.

   The leading office supplies retailer,
   <company id="14790">
    Staples
   </company>
   , is ACCO's largest customer, accounting for 13% of its sales. (Together Office Depot and OfficeMax, which are slated to merge, would account for 15% of ACCO's sales.

        <p>
   ACCO's total sales increased by a third in 2012 compared with 2011 to more than $1.7 billion. The acquisition of Mead's Consumer &amp; Office Products business added about $551 million in sales, offsetting declining sales at the Computer Products Group (down 6%), the calendar business, and several foreign markets. The prolonged economic malaise in the UK drove sales in that market down 15% year-over-year. Net income more than doubled in 2012 compared with 2011 to more than $115 million on increasing revenue and an income tax benefit of $121 million received in 2012. Despite the robust sales increase in 2012, ACCO's revenue is still below the $1.95 billion rung up in 2006.

        <p>
   The school and office supplies company relies on a combination of organic growth, driven by new products, supplemented by acquisitions in emerging markets, such as Brazil.
  </p>
        <p>
   Challenges facing the company include consolidation in the office products retail sector as exemplified by the pending combination of the #2 and #3 players,
   <company id="14308">
    Office Depot
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10222">
    OfficeMax
   </company>
   . ACCO, meanwhile, has shown an increasing interest in supplying mass merchandisers (like Wal-Mart and
   <company id="10440">
    Target
   </company>
   ) with private-label products, which can provide an economic or merchandising advantage due to either their lower price point or more comprehensive lineup.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In May 2012 ACCO merged with Mead Consumer &amp; Office Products, a division of
   <company id="105577">
    MeadWestvaco
   </company>
   . The deal was valued at $860 million, out of which shareholders of MeadWestvaco (MWV) acquired 50.5% of the merged company. Strategically important, the combination of ACCO and MWV's Consumer &amp; Office Products (Mead COP) created a global Goliath in the manufacture and marketing of school and office products. ACCO added to its portfolio several major name brands, including Mead, Five Star, At-A-Glace, and Trapper Keeper, significant to its more demanding end-customers. Geographically, the deal expanded ACCO's share of the US and Canadian market (which represent approximately 60% of its sales), and extended its reach into Brazil.

        <p>
   ACCO is a veteran in assessing the strategic fit of its activities. The company was formerly a unit of Fortune Brands (now
   <company id="10075">
    Beam Inc.
   </company>
   and
   <company id="162562">
    Fortune Brands Home &amp; Security
   </company>
   ), which spun off the office products business known as ACCO World in 2005. ACCO World subsequently combined with binding and laminating equipment maker
   <company id="13550">
    General Binding Corporation
   </company>
   and changed its name to ACCO Brands.
