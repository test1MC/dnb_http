  <p>
   The company's Mykon series of bleach activators are based on the organic compound tetraacetylethylenediamine (TAED), which is produced by the acetylation of ethylenediamine. The pure TAED is then granulated to customer's specifications for particle size and color. Is it the TAED that allows clothes to be washed at lower temperatures and is also used in dishwashing products. Acetic acid, a by-product of the manufacturing of TAED, is processed into sodium acetate and also supplied to the detergent industry.

   Warwick planned early on to expand through acquisitions, with a focus on specialty chemicals manufacturers and distributors in Europe and Asia. However, to focus on development of its manufacturing business, it sold its own distribution businesses to Dutch chemical distributing company IMCD Group in 2010. The next year the company widened its global reach by choosing the Moscow-based GEM Group as its distributor in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. Warwick Chemicals had inked a distribution agreement the previous year with the GEM Group for the Middle East and North Africa.

   In late 2011 the company's main division, Warwick Chemicals, signed a contract with Rockwell Automation worth $1.9 million to replace the division's aging distributed control system (DCS) with Rockwell's PlantPAx process automation system. The new DCS is expected to reduce maintenace costs and provide better production insight.
