   Polar Corp. in 2011 acquired the Deep South beverage manufacturing plant in Fitzgerald, Georgia, from grocer
   <company id="11642">
    Winn-Dixie
   </company>
   . The facility makes Chek brand carbonated soft drinks, which Polar Corp. continues to supply to the grocery chain under a five-year supply agreement between the two companies. The acquisition furthers Polar Corp.'s southern growth strategy.

  <p>
   Part of Polar Corp.'s business strategy is keeping its finger on the pulse of the industry. Rather than join beverage makers, such as Texas-based Buddha's Brew and its slightly alcoholic Kombucha drink, Polar Corp. has partnered with Frontier Beverage, based in Tennessee, to distribute Unwind, a 100% alcohol-free drink made using calming ingredients, such as melatonin and valerian root.
  </p>
  <p>
   To capitalize on the popularity of juice drinks and bottled teas, Polar Corp. has introduced two lines of bottled and canned Black Jack and Caribbean teas in recent years, as well as a juice drink called fruit a peel.

  <p>
   The business traces its roots to the the J.G. Bieberbach Company, which was acquired by Dennis Crowley in 1916. It began as a liquor retail and wholesale operation; however, Prohibition, which began in 1919, forced Polar to switch to non-alcoholic products. It introduced ginger ale and spring water, and later, soft drinks to its offerings. After Prohibition was repealed in 1933, Polar remained a soft drinks business.
