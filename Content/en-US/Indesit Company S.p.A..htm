   Indesit is in the house! Formerly Merloni Elettrodomestici, the company produces home appliances (refrigerators, washing machines, dishwashers, and ovens) at 17 manufacturing plants spanning Italy, Poland, Russia, the UK, Turkey, and China. Its products are made and sold under the Hotpoint-Ariston, Indesit, Scholt√®s, and Stinol brands, with the first three being its most popular. Western Europe accounts for more than half of Indesit's sales. One of Indesit's innovations was its launch of a line of Hotpoint appliances designed for the blind, which features Braille controls and an audio instruction booklet. Whirlpool took control of the 30-year-old company (previously controlled by the Merloni family) in 2014.

   and China's
   <company id="140692">
    Sichuan Chaghong Electric

   . The Whirlpool deal, valued at around $1 billion, expanded the appliance giant's presence in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region. Whirlpool holds a 66.8% stake in Indesit.
