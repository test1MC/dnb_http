   Goss International always has some pressing news. The company manufactures newspaper, packaging, and commercial web printing presses and finishing systems for newspapers, commercial printers, direct mail, magazine, catalog, and other high-volume print applications. Distribution of Goss presses, related parts, and services is driven through sales offices and plants in North America, Europe, and Asia. The company sells to newspaper publishers in more than 120 countries, including
   <em>
    The People's Daily
   </em>
   (China). Goss is owned by

   </company>
   , one of China's largest electrical equipment makers.

  <p>
   The company operates as a part of the industrial equipment segment of its parent company. This segment contributed about 32% of its parent's total revenue in 2013 and saw its revenues increase by 7% from 2012 to 2013.

  <p>
   The slow economy has forced several hard choices for Goss. In mid-2013, it cut 300 more jobs and closed down its France operations altogether; it also merged its European operations into a more cohesive and unified sales and service organization.
  </p>
  <p>
   Goss aims to step ahead of its competition by enhancing its product portfolio through an array of patented improvements. Over the years it has introduced a stream of enhancements in web offset presses, print finishing systems, and variable repeat packaging presses.

  <p>
   Since 1993 its subsidiary, Shanghai Printing &amp; Packaging Machinery, and Goss have operated a joint venture (Shanghai Goss Graphic Systems), producing Goss web-offset presses for the international market. The venture merged with Goss after Shanghai Electric acquired Goss in mid-2010 for $1.5 billion.
