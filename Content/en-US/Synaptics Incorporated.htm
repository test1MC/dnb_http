   Synaptics keeps you in touch with your electronics. The company's human interface products are sold to contract manufacturers for use in mobile phones (more than half of sales), notebook and handheld computers, and other mobile electronic devices. Its TouchPad product can be used in peripherals such as monitors and remote controls; ClickPad replaces a mouse for notebook PCs and netbooks; and ClearPad provides touchscreen control for various mobile devices. Synaptics also relies on contract manufacturers to make its products. Most sales go to manufacturers in Asia, more than two thirds in China. US customers provide 10% of sales.

   While Synaptics operates in one segment, it breaks down its sales between products headed for mobile devices and those destined for PCs. Mobile products account for 88% of revenue and PC product, 12%. The large mobile share reflects the wide adoption of touch screens for smartphones and tablets while PCs have yet to make touchscreens a standard option.
  </p>
  <p>
   Synaptics' technology, engineering, and product design functions in the US, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, Japan, India, and China incurred $311 million of expenses in 2016 (ended June).
