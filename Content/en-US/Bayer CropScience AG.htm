   If people turn to Bayer for what ails them, why can't plants? Bayer CropScience, a part of German chemicals and pharmaceuticals giant
   <company id="41808">
    Bayer Group
   </company>
   , is a leading producer of agricultural chemicals. The company's Crop Protection unit makes fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides. Bayer CropScience also operates units that focus on non-crop chemicals (such as consumer lawn products) and genetically modified seeds. The company ranks as the #2 crop protection firm worldwide, behind

   In a strategic move in 2010, Bayer CropScience sold its Myconate Intellectual Property portfolio to London-based Plant Health Care PLC. Myconate is a patented, synthetic compound that encourages plant growth by stimulating existing fungi in the soil and creating a bigger root mass. That same year, Bayer CropScience sold its cotton defoliant product Tribufos (marketed under the trade name Def) to

   </company>
   . Later that year, Bayer CropScience acquired wheat breeding programs from two Ukrainian breeding companies, SORT and EUROSORT. The deal gave Bayer CropScience access to wheat lines with winter hardiness and drought tolerance.
