   Dril-Quip equips the folks who operate the expensive drills -- the global deepwater oil and gas industry. The company specializes in deepwater, harsh-environment, and/or severe-condition equipment. Its products include drilling and production riser systems, subsea and surface wellheads and production trees, mudline hanger systems (which support the weight of each casing string at the mudline), and specialty connectors and pipe. Dril-Quip's offshore rig equipment includes drilling and completion riser systems, wellhead connectors, and diverters. The company also provides reconditioning, tool rental, and technical advisory services.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Dril-Quip's operations are organized into three geographic segments: Western Hemisphere (including North and South America; headquartered in Houston), Eastern Hemisphere (including Europe and Africa; headquartered in Aberdeen, Scotland) and Asia/Pacific (including the Pacific Rim, Southeast Asia, Australia, India, and the Middle East; headquartered in Singapore).
  </p>
  <p>
   Each of these segments sells similar products and services and the company has major manufacturing facilities in all three of its headquarter locations, as well as in Macae, Brazil. Dril-Quip has sales, service and reconditioning facilities in Australia, China, Denmark, Egypt, Ghana, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, Qatar, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company generated 63% of its total revenues outside of the US.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Dril-Quip's revenues are generated from two sources: products and services. Product revenues are derived from the sale of offshore drilling and production equipment. Service revenues are earned when the company provides technical advisory assistance services for installation of Dril-Quip's  products, reconditioning services of its customer-owned products and rental of running tools for installation and retrieval of the company's products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Dril-Quip  derived 83% of its revenues from the sale of products and 17% from services (compared to 84% and 16% in 2013).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Dril-Quip markets its products through its offices and sales representatives in the world's major energy markets. It markets its products and services directly through its sales personnel in two US and 20 international locations. In addition, in some international markets where the company does not maintain offices, it sells through independent sales representatives. The company has sales representatives in Brazil, China, India,  Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Sales are geared at major integrated, large independent, and foreign national oil and gas companies. A portion of its customer base consists of offshore drilling contractors and engineering and construction companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dril-Quip advertises its products and services in trade and technical publications and participates in industry conferences and trade shows to enhance industry awareness of its products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is not dependent on any one customer; its top 15 customers represented 61% of total revenues in 2014.
  </p>

  <p>
   In 2014 Dril-Quip's net revenues increased by 7%. Product revenues increased due to higher subsea and offshore rig equipment sales, partially offset by sales decreases in surface equipment. The increase in subsea equipment revenues came from higher demand in the Gulf of Mexico. Product revenues increased in the Western Hemisphere by $10.2 million, by $19.1 million in the Eastern Hemisphere, and and by $12.3 million in the Asia-Pacific region.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company reported increased service revenues in the Western Hemisphere by $2.2 million, $13.1 million in the Eastern Hemisphere and $1.7 million in the Asia-Pacific region.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dril-Quip's net income increased by 23% in 2014 due to higher net sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities decreased by 8% due to an increase in trade receivables and inventories.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company continually introduces new products and product enhancements and sees its ability to develop new products and maintain technological advantages as key to its future success. Dril-Quip has introduced multiple new products including liner hangers, subsea control systems, and subsea manifolds.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dril-Quip's product development work is conducted at its facilities in Houston, Texas and Aberdeen, Scotland. The company's application engineering staff provides engineering services to customers in connection with the design and sales of its products. The company's global manufacturing and servicing locations allow it to have short supply lines and delivery times for its clients in far-flung oil and gas fields worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   It continued its work on several dry tree field development projects in 2014 and completed the manufacturing, testing and delivery of dry tree systems for Brazil's first Tension Leg Production Platform. Several additional large-scale dry tree projects moved through the design, engineering, manufacturing, assembly and test stages in preparation for delivery to major operators for installation in the Gulf of Mexico and the Asia-Pacific region. The company's Aftermarket Services department has demonstrated that it will be a vital component of the company's overall strategic plan going forward.

  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding its manufacturing base, in 2011 Dril-Quip opened a new manufacturing plant in Singapore valued at $33.2 million.
  </p>
