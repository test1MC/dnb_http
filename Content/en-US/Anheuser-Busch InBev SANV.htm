   Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) knows how to say "beer" in a lot of languages. The world's largest brewer operates more than 140 breweries across six geographic regions worldwide. It boasts a product list of 200-plus brands, including global best-sellers Budweiser (brewed by
   <company id="10116">
    Anheuser Busch
   </company>
   ), Corona, Aguila, Fosters, Stella Artois, and Beck's. The Belgian brewer holds a slew of regional beers, including Leffe and Hoegaarden, as well as local favorites Michelob, Skol, and Brahma. AB InBev controls Mexico's largest brewer,
   <company id="52130">
    Grupo Modelo
   </company>
   , which produces Corona Extra, Modelo Especial, and Pacifico. In a milestone deal for the brewing industry, AB InBev acquired rival
   <company id="54451">
    SABMiller
   </company>
   in a transaction valued at $108 billion.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In addition to its beverage production, AB InBev has some 40 global facilities making everything from malt syrup to hop pellets to labels, bottles, and cans. It also has hop farms in Germany and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Non-beer operations include an exclusive license to bottle and distribute
   <company id="11166">
    PepsiCo
   </company>
   products (Pepsi, 7UP, and Gatorade) in Brazil through its
   <company id="48025">
    Ambev
   </company>
   subsidiary. The unit also handles PepsiCo products in other parts of Latin America and has a exclusive deal to distribute Monster Energy drinks in Brazil. Soft drinks account for nearly 10% of AB InBev revenue.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company brews beer and soda at plants spread across its six geographic zones. Latin America North and Asia Pacific have the highest number of factories with about 70 each. Latin America South and North America come in next with around 40 each. Western Europe, the original home of the InBev part of AB InBev has more than 15 and the Central and Eastern Europe region has around 10. Most of the facilities produce beer but more than 20 produce both beer and soda and about a dozen (mostly in Latin America) make only soda.
  </p>
  <p>
   During fiscal 2014 North America accounted for 34% of sales, Latin America North 24%, Mexico 10%, Latin America South 6%, Europe 10%, and Asia Pacific 11%.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company distributes it products globally according to local regulations and agreements. Generally, it pursues direct distribution where possible and indirect distribution elsewhere. When using indirect distribution, it strives to secure exclusive agreements. In regions where AB InBev has no direct affiliates, it often licenses local brewers to produce its key brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though the company has a long list of brands, its employs a "focus brands" marketing strategy wherein its concentrates money, people, and attention on the brands that account for about 70% of its beer sales by volume. Those include its three global brands Budweiser, Beck's, and Stella Artois; what it calls multi-country brands (Leffe and Hoegaarden); and its 'local champions' including Bud Light, Jupiler, Sibirskaya Korona,  Skol, Harbin, and Quilmes.

  <p>
   AB InBev reported $47 billion in revenue for fiscal 2014. That was an increase of 9% compared to fiscal 2013. The company reported net income of $9.2 billion for fiscal 2014, which was a 36% decrease compared its net income in the prior fiscal period.

  <p>
   AB InBev acquired British rival SABMiller for around $108 billion -- the third largest takeover in corporate history -- in late 2016 after clearing a slew of regulatory hurdles. The acquisition required the sale of some of SABMiller's key brands, including its 58% stake in MillerCoors, which owns brands such as Blue Moon, Coors and Coors Light, to
   <company id="12519">
    Molson Coors
   </company>
   , the owner of the remaining 42%.
  </p>
  <p>
   AB InBev also sold SABMiller's Grolsch, Peroni and Meantime beer brands to Japanese brewer Asahi for $2.9 billion, as well as its stake in CR Snow, SABMiller's Chinese joint venture, to
   <company id="55206">
    China Resources Beer (Holdings) Company Limited.
   </company>
   The acquisition also impacted AB InBev's sales strategy: it is no longer allowed to incentivize vendors to sell more of its beers than others. A key driver behind the acquisition was SABMiller's strength in Latin America and Africa, which complements AB InBev's existing strength in Western Europe and North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   The combined company is one of the world's largest consumer products companies, ranking alongside
   <company id="41850">
    Unilever
   </company>
   in terms of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In both developed and developing markets, which each account for about half the company's sales, AB InBev focuses its efforts on it core brands while developing regional favorites as well. It uses large events and social media to stay connected with its customers and introduce new products to bring in new customers.

  <p>
   In late 2015 AB InBev reached an agreement to acquire British rival SABMiller, and 13 months of wrangling with regulators later the deal was sealed for $108 billion -- the largest deal in brewing history (and the third largest ever). The deal required the sale of various SABMiller interests, including its majority stake in MillerCoors, which it sold to Molson Coors (who owned the remaining 42%), as well as its Grolsch, Peroni and Meantime brands. The combined company controls around a third of the total global beer supply. AB InBev gained beers such as Fosters, an Australian beer, and Castle Beer, the most popular brew in Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 AB InBev acquired almost all of Mexico's largest beer company, Grupo Modelo (it had already owned 50%), for some $20 billion. Owner of the ubiquitous south of the US border brands Corona Extra, Modelo Especial, and Pacifico, Modelo will help expand AB InBev's annual revenues to around $47 billion with operations in 24 countries. The deal allows AB InBev further exposure in emerging markets like Mexico, an economy that grew by 4.6% in the first quarter of 2012. Part of the arrangement include selling Grupo Modelo's US business to rival brewer Constellation Brands for about $5 billion.

  <p>
   Monks at the Leffe Abbey in Belgium were brewing beer as early as 1240, and surviving records from 1366 mention Belgium's Den Horen brewery. Belgian master brewer Sebastien Artois (best known for his Stella Artois lager) took over Den Horen in 1717. In 1853 the Piedboeuf family founded a brewery at Liege and established the Jupiler lager. Albert Van Damme assumed management of that brewery in 1920.
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the years, the Artois and Piedboeuf families took over or established operations both in and outside Belgium. Direct descendants (the clans de Spoelberch, Van Damme, and de Mevius) of the two families were still managing the companies in 1987 when they decided the key to survival in the fragmented European beer market was to merge.
  </p>
  <p>
   Artois-Piedboeuf-Interbrew acquired the Hoegaarden brewery in Belgium in 1989. The company changed its name to Interbrew three years later, acquired another Belgian brewery (Belle-Vue), and bought stakes in breweries in Bulgaria, Croatia, and Hungary. In 1995 Dommelsche Bierbrouwerij bought Allied Breweries Nederland, an
   <company id="50001">
    Allied Domecq
   </company>
   subsidiary, and Interbrew acquired the Oranjeboom breweries in the Netherlands.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company purchased John Labatt Ltd. for $2 billion in 1995. As a result of the deal, Interbrew gained control of Latrobe Brewing (Rolling Rock beer, US), 22% of Mexico's
   <company id="116587">
    FEMSA Cerveza
   </company>
   (increased to 30% in 1998), the Toronto Argonauts football team, 90% of the
   <company id="46710">
    Toronto Blue Jays
   </company>
   (it sold an 80% stake in the baseball team to cable firm
   <company id="42405">
    Rogers Communications
   </company>
   in 2000) and various broadcast properties.
  </p>
  <p>
   Interbrew sold many noncore assets, including Lehigh Valley Dairies (US) and John Labatt Retail (pubs, UK), in 1996. Also that year the company established joint ventures in the Dominican Republic and the US (to import Mexican beers through FEMSA).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Interbrew paid $250 million for 50% of the Doosan Group's Oriental Brewery, South Korea's second-largest brewer, and bought a majority stake in Russian brewer Rosar. The next year Interbrew combined its Russian operations with Sun Brewing, forming Russian brewer Sun-Interbrew. It then bought Korea's Jinro-Coors Brewery for about $378 million. Hugo Powell was later named CEO of Interbrew.
  </p>
  <p>
   Interbrew bought Britain's third-largest brewer, Whitbread Beer Company, in 2000 for $590 million. Having gained a foothold in the UK market, the company then bought Bass Brewers from Bass PLC in 2000 for more than $3 billion. Interbrew went public on the
   <company id="102397">
    Euronext (Brussels)
   </company>
   exchange in 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Baron Paul De Keersmaeker retired as chairman and was replaced by Pierre Jean Everaert. That year the company took an 80% stake in Germany's tenth-largest brewer, Diebels. Interbrew also sold Carling, which controls about 18% of the UK beer market, to
   <company id="12519">
    Coors
   </company>
   for $1.7 billion, after being ordered to remedy unfair competition advantages related to the Bass Brewers purchase.
  </p>
  <p>
   John Brock, former COO of Cadbury Schweppes became CEO of Interbrew in 2003. That year it sold a minority stake of its Namibian Breweries in southern Africa to
   <company id="55181">
    Diageo
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41852">
    Heineken
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Interbrew purchased a 70% stake in Chinese brewer Zhejiang Shiliang, which gave Interbrew nearly a 50% market share in China's Zhejiang province.
  </p>
  <p>
   InBev was created through a 2005 merger of Interbrew and AmBev. The merger resulted in a series of transactions between Interbrew subsidiary Labatt and Mexico's FEMSA. By creating InBev, Interbrew gave up interest in distributing FEMSA beer brands in the US. In return, Interbrew retained full control of the US division of Labatt. InBev merged Labatt U.S.A. with what was Beck's North America to create its US operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Exiting the Slovenian market, InBev sold its stake in Pivovarna Union to Pivovarna Lasko in 2005. That year it also acquired Russian premium brewer Tinkoff and sold its stake in soft-drink company Bremer Erfrischungsgetränke to
   <company id="10359">
    Coca-Cola
   </company>
   . It sold its minority stake in Spanish brewer Damm as well. At year-end Carlos Brito, formerly zone president for the company's North American operations, succeeded John Brock as CEO of InBev.
  </p>
  <p>
   Saying it intended to concentrate on import brands in the US market, in 2006 the company sold subsidiary InBev USA's domestic beer brand Rolling Rock to
   <company id="10116">
    Anheuser-Busch
   </company>
   for $82 million. Later in the year InBev and A-B struck an additional deal for A-B to serve as the exclusive distributor for some of its European brands, such as Beck's, Bass, and Stella Artois. In addition it paid some $1 billion to increase its stake in
   <company id="91430">
    Quinsa
   </company>
   , an Argentine brewer, to 90% from 57% that year.
