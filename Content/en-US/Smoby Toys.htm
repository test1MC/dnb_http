Another unit makes plastic packaging products, bottles, flasks, and containers for industrial customers. Sales outside France account for more than half of the total. Germany-based toy rival

   Looking to fill up its portfolio, Smoby Toys in 2010 purchased its former subsidiary, Majorette, a toy car maker. The company had been acquired by investment fund MI-29 in 2007, when Smoby Toys shed the car maker while it was under receivership. The deal, which brought the brands Solido and Bao, cost Smoby Toys close to $1 million.
