   Incyte hopes its success with inhibitors is uninhibited. The biotechnology company is focused on discovering and developing drugs that inhibit specific enzymes associated with cancer, diabetes, blood disorders, and inflammatory diseases. The company's lead program is its JAK (Janus associated kinase) inhibitor program, which covers treatments for inflammatory diseases and cancers. Its first commercial product, JAKAFI, is approved for treatment of myelofibrosis (a rare blood cancer). Incyte's other JAK product candidates are in various stages of research and clinical trials, partially through partnerships with other drugmakers, for conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, solid tumors, and breast cancer.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   JAKAFI is available in the US and about 30 international countries.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Incyte gained
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval to market JAKAFI for several types of myelofibrosis in the US market in November 2011, and the company launched the drug shortly after. The drug also gained approval for myelofibrosis treatment in the European Union in 2012 (through a partnership with
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   ). Novartis has also gained approval for the drug in additional international markets. JAKAFI is under development for similar blood cancers, including polycythemia and thrombocythemia, and pancreatic cancer in the US.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company also has a partnership with
   <company id="10509">
    Eli Lilly
   </company>
   to develop a candidate for inflammatory disorders including rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. In addition, Incyte has several candidates under development for solid tumor cancers, one of which is being co-developed with Novartis.
  </p>
        <p>
   Outside of the JAK development programs, Incyte receives licensing fees by granting drug rights to other developers. For instance
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   holds rights for its CCR2 receptor antagonist program, including treatments for rheumatoid arthritis and insulin-resistant obese patients.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
        <p>
   JAKAFI is marketed by Incyte's direct sales force to oncologists and hematologists and is distributed through third-party specialty pharmacies throughout the US. While Incyte retains all marketing rights to JAKAFI in the US market, Novartis holds all international development and marketing rights for the drug.

        <p>
   Collaboration and licensing fees are the lifeblood of pharmaceutical research and development companies, helping them to sustain operations as R&amp;D costs skyrocket. In addition, dependence on partnership income causes revenues to fluctuate rapidly from year to year as the company receives milestone payments based on a candidate's progress through development and commercialization stages.
  </p>
        <p>
   Despite having launched its first commercial product in 2011, more than half of Incyte's earnings in 2012 came from collaboration and milestone contracts. Revenues jumped 215% in fiscal 2012 to some $297 million as the company reported a healthy increase in contract revenue (from milestone payments and fees from both Novartis and Lilly) and a large jump in product income from sales of JAKAFI.
  </p>
        <p>
   The firm has reported a net income loss each year since its formation as R&amp;D expenses outweigh earnings, and it does not expect to achieve profitability until it has more substantial commercial operations.

   In recent years, Incyte has been focused on building up its commercialization infrastructure to support sales of JAKAFI in the US. It also continues to put extensive resource into its internal drug research and development programs. In addition, Incyte is pursuing new commercialization partnerships for other pipeline drugs.

        <p>
   British entrepreneur Roy Whitfield and researcher Randal Scott met in 1989 while working for Invitron, a biotech company that soon went under. They founded Incyte Pharmaceuticals in 1991 to design, develop, and market genomic database products, software tools, and related services.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company went public in 1993, and in 1994
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   became its first gene expression database subscriber. Two years later Incyte bought gene-mapping firms Genome Systems and Combion. The firm opened an office in Cambridge, UK, and formed joint venture
   <company id="102737">
    diaDexus
   </company>
   with SmithKline Beecham (now
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   ) to create and market diagnostic tests that use genetic data to develop effective drug reagents and services.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1998 the firm bought microarray maker Synteni. It made its own attempt to map the human genome using LifeSeq, buying British firm Hexagen for the mapping unit. Two years later,
   <company id="102737">
    diaDexus
   </company>
   filed an IPO, and the company changed its name to Incyte Genomics to reflect its focus. The name change, however, seemed shortsighted when, in 2001, the firm announced plans to become a drug developer. It even teamed with one-time rival
   <company id="60896">
    Agilent
   </company>
   to share DNA microarray technologies.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2003 the company made another name change -- this time simply to "Incyte Corporation" -- to represent its growing focus on drug development. As part of that focus, that year Incyte acquired the rights to Reverset in 2003 through a licensing agreement with Pharmasset.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2004, the company transitioned away from its former business -- providing access to its genomic database and set of patents. In that year Incyte closed its Palo Alto, California, research facilities and headquarters. It also terminated further development of its information products, including LifeSeq -- a library of information and expressed sequences that links biological information analysis with proprietary genetic information to aid drug discovery. In addition to closing the Palo Alto office, the company reduced its workforce by more than 50%.
  </p>
        <p>
   Following the transition, a leading product candidate for the company was dexelvucitabine (also known as Reverset) to treat patients with HIV, but clinical trials were discontinued in 2006. In 2008 it also halted development on a CCR5 antagonist designed to prevent the entry of HIV into target cells.
