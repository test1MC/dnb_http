   Demand for RPAs (remotely piloted aircraft) is on the upswing given the latest defense spending trends. The
   <company id="105717">
    US Department of Defense
   </company>
   announced that it is refocusing funding from combat warfare equipment to unmanned systems, advanced sensors, and other high-tech systems that support the US and its allies' ongoing military activities in the Middle East. Funding is being channeled toward products that boost the military's speed, flexibility, precision, and responsiveness. Based on this trend, forecasts estimate that the RPA market will double in the next 10 years.

   GA-ASI's flagship product, the Predator, was named by

   's Air &amp; Space magazine as one of the top ten aircraft that changed the world. It is one of the most combat-proven RPA and is currently used in Afghanistan to pick up enemy communications and transmit video feeds to ground troops and operations centers on the other side of the globe.

   In general, the company's RPAs are less expensive to operate than manned aircraft and are able to remain in the air for longer periods of time. Other advantages include the fact its RPAs are versatile -- they can be outfitted with missiles, turning them from drones into combat aircraft. These attributes make the aircraft highly attractive to the foreign and domestic agencies that use them, including the
