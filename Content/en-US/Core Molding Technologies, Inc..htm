   The core business of Core Molding Technologies is fiberglass reinforced plastic and sheet molding composite materials. Through compression molding, sprayup, hand layup, and vacuum-assisted resin infusion molding, the company makes truck components (air deflectors, fenders, hoods) and personal watercraft parts (decks, hulls, and engine hatches). It divides its operations into two segments: Products and Tooling.
   <company id="11063">
    Navistar International
   </company>
   accounts for one-third sales, and other major customers include heavy-duty truck manufacturers Volvo and
   <company id="14354">
    PACCAR
   </company>
   . The company's sales are confined to North America.

  <p>
   With Navistar and PACCAR collectively representing 68% of sales and the medium and heavy-duty truck market accounting for more than 80%, it's an understatement to say that Core Molding Technologies has a limited number of customers.

  <p>
   After posting $162 million in 2012 (a company milestone), Core Molding saw its revenues decline 11% to $144 million in 2013. Profits also slipped 16% from $8.2 million in 2012 to $6.9 million in 2013 due to a spike in selling, general, and administrative expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue decline for 2013 was driven by lower demand for its products from customers in the medium and heavy-duty truck market. In particular, Core Molding experienced an overall decline in demand from Navistar. After experiencing two straight years of growth, Core Molding saw its operating cash flow decrease by $8 million in 2013.

    Navistar, Inc.

   ).
