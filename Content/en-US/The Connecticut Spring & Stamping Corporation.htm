   The Connecticut Spring &amp; Stamping Corporation (CSS) knows how to put the machine to the metal. The company manufactures a variety of metal springs, stampings, and machined metal components (including wire forms, metal forms, precision machined parts, fineblanked parts, and assemblies) used in aerospace and defense products, firearms, medical instruments, consumer products, and other end-products. It specializes in making springs and stampings, including compression, extension, torsion, and magazine springs and custom metal stampings. CCS operates 200,000 sq. ft of manufacturing space in the US.

   To provide additional production capacity, in 2014 the company bought a 51,000 sq. ft. new building in Connecticut. The building, which will allow for more efficient production layouts and provide for future business growth, will accommodate nearly $2 million of additional equipment, including spring coiling, fine blanking, CNC machining, Swiss machining equipment, and assembly operations. Its expanded machining capabilities include multi-axis CNC Swiss machining, ideal for medical applications (including minimally invasive surgical instruments), as well as a number of aerospace and firearms applications.
