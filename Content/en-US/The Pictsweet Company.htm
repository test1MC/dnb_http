   The Pictsweet Company is a veritable veggie volcano. It grows broccoli, carrots, corn, kale, okra, peas, and loads of other vegetables and then quick-freezes them for sale in supermarkets. The firm offers more than 100 products (including stir-fry blends and baby and preseasoned vegetables) in family-sized, regular, and bulk portions. Pictsweet provides vegetables nationwide under its own name and for retailers' private labels (including

    Kroger
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   's Great Value brands). It also supplies foodservice operators (restaurants and hotels), institutional customers (such as hospitals and schools), and military commissaries worldwide. Founded in 1945, Pictsweet is a fourth-generation family-owned company.

   Pictsweet, one of the world's largest processors of frozen vegetables, maintains several processing plants and cold-storage warehouses in its home state of Tennessee, as well as in California, Texas, Delaware, and Utah.

   As part of its business, the vegetable supplier relies on independent farmers to supplement the yield it gets from its own Pictsweet farms. After acquiring a 164,724-sq.-ft. plant in 2013 from Riviana Foods for $2.35 million, Pictsweet moved into the Jackson, Tennessee, facility in 2014.
