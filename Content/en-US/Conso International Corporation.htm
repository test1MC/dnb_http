   When it comes to window decorations, Conso International is happy to be known as a leading fringe business. The world's #1 maker of decorative trim for home furnishings, Conso's trimming products include fringe, cords, braid, and upholstery edging (called gimp). The lineup is made from a variety of yarns and new media. Additionally, the company makes decorative accessories, from tassels to tiebacks and buttons. Its production facilities operate in Coimbatore, India, and in Shanghai. Conso products are sold to manufacturers, distributors, and retail outlets through its distribution center in Nashville, Tennessee. Founded in 1867, Conso merged with ribbon and trimmings manufacturer Wm. Wright Co. in 2000.

   Conso International's history extends back to 1867, when it was a maker of hat trimmings. Sara Lee purchased the firm in 1968, then sold it to Springs Industries in 1979. Conso drifted under Springs until it was sold in 1986 to an investor group led by former CEO Cary Findlay. He expanded the company's market beyond retailers (such as Kmart and Sears) to include interior decorators and makers of home furnishings (now its main markets).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company went public in 1993. Proceeds from the IPO funded several acquisitions of decorative trimmings makers that included British Trimmings (1993) and Conso Graber Canada and Wendy Cushing Trimmings (UK) in 1994. The following year Findlay relinquished his roles as president and CEO, but remained chairman.

   To expand its offerings and production capacity, Conso bought Claesson (decorative brassware) in 1996. The next year it moved into window decorations by purchasing HFDC. The company, then named Conso Products, changed its name to Conso International in 1998. Findlay again took the reins as president and CEO. That year it nearly doubled its size by buying Simplicity Pattern Co., a purchase that expanded Conso's home sewing market and provided opportunities for cross-selling its sewing products. Conso further diversified with its 1999 purchase of resin furnishings maker The Hwalek Corporation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Citicorp Venture Capital and management (including Findlay), through CIC Acquisition, took Conso private by acquiring it in 2000. That year Conso acquired ribbon and trim maker Wm. E. Wright, LP. In 2002 chairman, president, and CEO Cary Findlay stepped down, replaced by Frank Rizzo.
