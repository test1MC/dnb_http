   That sweet smell of success might be coming from the ovens at Bahlsen. One of Germany's leading manufacturers of sweet biscuits (or as Americans call them, cookies), the company makes Leibniz butter biscuits, a favorite among consumers since it was introduced in 1891, and Hit brand cookies. Bahlsen also makes upscale products, such as chocolate-dipped Pick Up! snack bars. With half a dozen production facilities in Europe, the company exports products to more than 80 countries and offers private-label production services. Bahlsen's sales are roughly split between the domestic and export markets. The family of founder Hermann Bahlsen, led by his grandson Werner Bahlsen, continues to control the company.

  <p>
   Bahlsen's crumb trail leads back to German export merchant Hermann Bahlsen. He worked in England's sugar industry, which included industrial production of biscuits and cakes. Since these items weren't available in Germany, Bahlsen started a new business. He bought a Hanover biscuit factory in 1889. In 1893, with 100 employees, the company (Cakesfabrik H. Bahlsen) received a Chicago World Exhibition top award for Leibniz Cakes. These butter biscuits were named after Hanover Renaissance man Gottfried Leibniz, a philosopher, physicist, and author who died in 1716.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1912 the company exported items to 31 countries. That year it was renamed H. Bahlsens Keksfabrik. Founder Bahlsen died in 1919. Three of his four sons joined the business: Hans (in 1919), Werner (1922), and Klaus (1930). In 1950 Bahlsen was Germany's first sweets manufacturer to receive a post-WWII export license. In 1956 the founder's grandson Hermann Bahlsen, (son of Hans), joined the company, which by then exported to 74 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1960s Bahlsen's savory snacks division (which had started in 1900 with crackers) expanded through takeovers of German companies, and introducing new products including nuts and potato crisps. Bahlsen also opened offices in North America and Belgium.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1970s saw continued global expansion. Mid-decade, two more of the founder's grandsons (sons of Werner), Lorenz and Werner M. Bahlsen, joined the firm.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquiring North Carolina's Austin Quality Foods, Bahlsen began US production in 1980. The senior Werner Bahlsen died in 1985. In the early 1990s the firm became active in Eastern Europe, including Russia and Poland. Werner M. Bahlsen joined the company board in 1992 and became chair in 1993. Also in 1993 the Bahlsen Group began restructuring, creating separate sweet and savory snacks divisions. The group's name changed from H. Bahlsens Keksfabrik KG to Bahlsen KG.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 Hermann Bahlsen traded his ownership in Bahlsen for control of US subsidiary Austin Quality Foods; in 2000 he sold Austin to Keebler. Brothers Werner M. and Lorenz Bahlsen, plus brother-in-law Gisbert von Nordeck were the remaining Bahlsen shareholders. Bahlsen experienced negative earnings in 1997, but was profitable in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eventually industry pressures and family disputes led to the 1999 splintering of the company three ways, but still into family hands. Werner M. took over the sweet biscuit business, which kept the Bahlsen GmbH name and identity. Lorenz took control of the salty snack business, which was eventually named The Lorenz Bahlsen Snack-World (its products dropped the Bahlsen name and logo and now use the Lorenz brand). Gisbert von Nordeck assumed control of the company's Swiss and Austrian businesses as well as some real estate and financial services providers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Company sales of the newly streamlined Bahlsen increased in 1999. That year the company released PiCK UP!, a chocolate-and-biscuit bar developed to meet changing customer demands for snack foods and portability. The company spent more money than it ever had on a product launch, and consumers in core markets bought it.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company revised recipes in 2001, tweaked packaging, and added entirely new items, including Mini Mandel Spitzen, a bite-sized gingerbread. Bahlsen also launched new London TV ads for core product Choco Leibniz, with provocative phrases such as "place your tongue in every corner of my all-butter biscuit." Initial ads in Scotland caused sales to surge.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2001 the company created a new subsidiary to oversee its private-label business, and promoted its upscale Cielo chocolate-dipped biscuit.
