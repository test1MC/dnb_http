   Mechel is forging ahead with its steel business while minding its own mining business. The company is one of Russia's largest manufacturers of specialty steels, alloys, and long steel products (along with

   and

    Severstal
   </company>
   ). Mechel's steel operations mainly consist of semi-finished steel, carbon and specialty long products, and stainless steel flat products used in the automotive, construction, chemical, and rail industries. Through its mining operations, Mechel produces the coal, iron ore, and nickel used in its steel operations, and it also sells these to outside customers. In addition, it owns stakes in power plants and a power distribution company. Chairman Igor Zyuzin owns a majority stake in the company.
