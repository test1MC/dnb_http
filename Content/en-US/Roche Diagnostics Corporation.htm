   Roche Holdings has expanded Roche Professional Diagnostics -- the largest diagnostics division -- through acquisitions. Headquartered in Switzerland, the Professional Diagnostics division conducts internal R&amp;D efforts that result in regular upgrade launches for existing equipment, as well as the development of new testing assays for additional health conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Roche Diagnostics is also expanding its second largest division, Germany-based Roche Diabetes Care, which makes insulin delivery pumps and diabetes diagnostics and monitoring products. The unit regularly seeks to better serve its customers by expanding its product offerings and improving its products' accuracy and usability.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the high-growth field of gene-based testing, Roche Molecular Diagnostics (which has its global headquarters in California) develops a variety of screening tools such as blood supply screening kits and HIV and hepatitis tests based on DNA analysis. The unit is also focused on developing and commercializing companion (or personalized) diagnostic products, which help doctors determine how a patient's genetic make-up will affect how that person will respond to drugs or other forms of treatment. The division is a leader in the molecular diagnostics field and has launched a broad line of DNA-based tests for disease detection and companion diagnostic purposes.

  <p>
   The Roche Tissue Diagnostics, which is primarily made up of Arizona-based subsidiary
   <company id="51340">
    Ventana Medical Systems
   </company>
   , develops systems that analyze human tissue for the diagnosis of cancers and other diseases. The Tissue Diagnostics unit is working to expand its offering of diagnostic probes; it is also working to develop companion diagnostic tests. In addition to growth through acquisitions, Ventana launches new product offerings through internal R&amp;D efforts and partnerships.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the global diagnostics division was investing 450 million Swiss francs (over three years) in a new diagnostic manufacturing facility in China.

  <p>
   In 2015 the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   granted CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) waiver for the company's cobas Strep A test for use on the cobas Liat System. It also provided 510(k) clearance for the cobas HSV 1 and 2 Test for the direct detection and differentiation of HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA in anogenital specimens from symptomatic patients.

   Roche Diagnostics Corporation traces its roots to the founding of Bio-Dynamics, Inc. in 1964 in Indianapolis. Bio-Dynamics was a producer of unimeter devices that allowed doctors to perform lab work in their offices. The company was acquired by
   <company id="41787">
    Roche Holdings
   </company>
   in 1974.
  </p>
  <p>
   Roche Diagnostics began offering diabtetes testing products in the US in the late 1970s. Then, in the early 1990s, it expanded into molecular testing for viral diseases.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's R&amp;D and acquisition growth strategies are not left behind with the its other (smaller) gene-based division, the Roche Applied Science unit (based in Germany). The division, which provides DNA sequencing products for life science and pharmaceutical researchers, has been the subject of aggressive growth efforts in recent years. It would have grown exponentially had Roche's efforts to take over research equipment maker
   <company id="100282">
    Illumina
   </company>
   in 2012 proven successful. However, after Illumina rejected Roche's $5.7 billion and $6.7 billion offers, Roche dropped its takeover attempts. The purchase would also have enhanced Roche Diagnostics' molecular diagnostics operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the Professional Diagnostics division launched a new automated laboratory system to improve hospital testing capacity and processing rates; the system combines Roche's new cobas 8000 modular analyzer with a modular pre-analytics sample handling system developed in partnership with Hitachi High-Technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Roche Diabetes Care launched a new software system that allows hospitals to automatically load patients' blood glucose results into their electronic health record (EHR) systems.
