   OSRAM Licht wants everyone to just lighten up. The company is one of the world's largest makers of lighting products. It makes lamps (including
   <company id="113171">
    Sylvania
   </company>
   - and OSRAM-branded products) for consumer and commercial uses, as well as for film photography. Through a joint venture with
   <company id="92020">
    Valeo
   </company>
   , OSRAM makes headlight and taillight assemblies that are distributed in North America. The company also makes lamp-related products (ballasts, fixtures), as well as light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Another OSRAM unit produces lighting components, such as glass, metals, and wiring.

  <p>
   <company id="41843">

   spun off OSRAM (about 80% of shares) in 2013. After the transaction, OSRAM cut some 4,700 jobs, about 12% of its overall workforce.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has operations (subsidiaries, sales locations, and partners) in more than 120 countries, and 33 production and manufacturing facilities in 14 countries.

  <p>
   OSRAM's reporting segments are LED Lamps &amp; Systems (LLS), Classic Lamps &amp; Ballasts (CLB), Luminaires &amp; Solutions (LS), Specialty Lighting (SP), and Opto Semiconductors (OS).
  </p>
  <p>
   LLS makes LED products as direct replacements for traditional lamps for general lighting, together with related components such as drivers. It develops and produces lamps and electronic control gear at the Shenzen (China) development site and at the plants in Monterrey (Mexico), Panyu (China) and Eichstätt (Germany).
  </p>
  <p>
   CLB comprises the traditional products of lamps and ballasts for general lighting. It has various production locations worldwide, including in Augsburg, Berlin, and Eichstätt (Germany), Foshan and Panyu (China), Versailles, Exeter (US), and Monterrey, Juarez (Mexico).
  </p>
  <p>
   LS includes both the production and sale of luminaires and the design and implementation of solutions for internal and external lighting, as well as the North American service business.
  </p>
  <p>
   SP develops, produces, and sells lamps and systems for various different sectors and special applications. It's largest business is automotive lighting but it also serves special and niche applications that employ light but are not used to provide lighting (such as lamps for cleaning, which use high-intensity UV light to irradiate (disinfect) surfaces, gases, and fluids).
  </p>
  <p>
   OS researches, develops, produces, and markets LED and other components relating to opto-semiconductor technology.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   OSRAM markets and customers include OEMs, installers/retailers, chain stores, and specialist retailers, lighting designers, architects, Original Equipment Suppliers (OESs), cinema and film studio operators, and facility managers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its products are marketed primarily under the OSRAM umbrella brand. Optoelectronic semiconductor components are sold under the OSRAM Opto Semiconductors brand. In North America, it also markets its products under the SYLVANIA brand. In the luminaires and light management markets, Traxon and Siteco are additional brands.

  <p>
   In 2014 OSRAM's net sales decreased by 3% due to lower sales from CLB and LS partially offset by higher LLS sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   LLS segment sales rose by more than 50% in 2014 as a result of the accelerated transition to LED technology observed in the lighting market, which pushed up demand for LED lamps, light engines, and drivers.
  </p>
  <p>
   CLB revenues were was down as a result of the industry's rapid shift to LED technology, which impacted both the consumer and the professional customer businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income increased by 475% in 2014 due to decreased marketing, selling, and general administrative expenses and the cost of goods sold and services rendered, partially offset by lower revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 OSRAM's net cash provided by the operating activities decreased by €33 million due to a change in inventories, trade receivables, and current liabilities.

  <p>
   Developments in the lighting market are dominated by the technology shift towards semiconductor-based lighting technology, which is opening up new technical opportunities in terms of color, dynamics, miniaturization, application integration, longevity, and energy efficiency. OSRAM continues to see growth opportunities in the global trend toward solid-state lighting (LEDs) and opto-semiconductor light sources.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 OSRAM launched the Oslon Black SFH 4713A, an infrared LED (IRED) with a wavelength of 850 nanometers (nm). It is ideally suited to security applications, such as camera-surveillance of public spaces, company premises and entrances to banks and shopping centers.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep up with LED demand, in 2014 the company opened an LED assembly plant in the Chinese city of Wuxi.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash, that year 2014 OSRAM divested its interest in the US joint venture Valeo Sylvania LLC (in the SP segment) and its equity interest in OSRAM China Fluorescent Materials Co. Ltd.

  <p>
   To further expand its position in the entertainment lighting market, in 2014 OSRAM acquired Clay Paky, a leading provider of entertainment lighting for shows and events. Clay Paky is part of OSRAM's SL segment.

  <p>
   The company purchased Germany-based Siteco Lighting from
   <company id="136014">
    Barclays Private Equity
   </company>
   in mid-2011. The addition not only gave OSRAM exposure to new markets, such as sports stadiums, but expanded the company's LED capabilities. In 2009 OSRAM was first to launch an LED lamp equivalent to the 40-watt light bulb. It also benefits from a strong position in the high-growth Asia/Pacific region. Through a joint venture with Hong Kong's Traxon Technologies, OSRAM has expanded its geographic footprint to offer its LED lineup used by the architectural, hospitality, and shop lighting market sectors.
  </p>
  <p>
   The name OSRAM derives from the combination of the metal
   <em>
    os
   </em>
   mium and the German word for tungsten, wolf
   <em>
    ram
   </em>
   . It is one of the oldest trade names known worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 China's Foshan Electrical and Lightning Co. Ltd, held about 13.5% of OSRAM.
