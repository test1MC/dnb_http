   Melinta (formerly Rib-X Pharmaceuticals) has found a weak spot in bacteria's ribosomes. The biopharmaceutical drug discovery and development company is working to create new antibiotics to treat drug-resistant infections. Melinta's leading drug candidates are delafloxacin for the treatment of methicillin-resistant
   <em>
    Staphylococcus aureus
   </em>
   (MRSA) and radezolid to treat community acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Its research targets binding sites on bacterial ribosomes to interrupt cell reproduction. The company was founded by Susan Froshauer, Peter Moore, and Thomas Steitz, who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the ribosome science that is the basis for the company's research.

        <p>
   Rib-X planned to use its IPO proceeds to take delafloxacin all the way through late-stage clinical trials and FDA approval. It will also keep advancing radezolid through Phase II studies. It retains the rights to commercialize its products in the US, but will need to build up those capabilities.

   Delafloxacin and radezolid are both in Phase II clinical development, and have the potential to be in great demand, if they make it to market, due to the increasing emergence of drug-resistant bacterial strains in health care settings. Outbreaks of hospital-acquired infections such as MRSA and CABP have proven hard to treat and can be fatal. Also, government plans like

    Medicaid and Medicare
   </company>
   now refuse to reimburse for expenses caused by infections acquired in health care settings. Patient care protocol changes are helpful, but the health care industry is eager to find new ways to eradicate the infections.

        <p>
   Along with Delafloxacin and Radezolid, Rib-X has other compounds in earlier stages of development. RX-04, in development through a collaboration with

   ,  has shown some effectiveness in treating a number of multi-drug resistant pathogens. The company performs its ribosome R&amp;D at its headquarters in Connecticut.
