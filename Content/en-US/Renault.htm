   Renault generates 95% of its revenue from automotive activities. The remaining 5% comes from sales financing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Renault's three brands are Renault, Dacia, and Renault Samsung Motors. It's best selling passenger cars, across the three brands, are the Renault Clio, the Dacia Duster, the Dacia Sandero, the Dacia Logan, and the Renault Samsung Motors Captur/QM3. Other well-known models include the Scénic, the Espace, and the Megane. It sells in the region of 2.8 million cars a year.

   Renault's native France is the company's largest single market and accounts for around 22%; Europe excluding France accounts for around 36%. The Americas; Eurasia; and Africa, the Middle East, and India account for 13% each. The Asia-Pacific region brings in 4%. Renault's highest market shares are in Morocco, Algeria, France, and Turkey.

   Sales have been more or less flat for the past five years, hanging around the €41 million mark. Profitability is up, however, by 223% in fiscal 2015, due in part to Renault's mutually beneficial relationships with Nissan that has helped Renault improve its production system. The companies share production facilities in Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, and Spain. Cash flow was up 115 to €4 billion.

  <p>
   The synergies between Renault and Nissan have produced a reciprocal benefit -- Renault has adopted a better production system with Nissan's support, and Nissan has embraced better cost-control measures practiced by Renault. The Alliance gives both companies a competitive edge over other automotive companies through shared technologies and platforms. For example, Nissan can use Renault's research when developing a diesel engine, and Renault can benefit from Nissan's battery technology. By sharing production facilities -- which the companies do in Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, and Spain -- they save on production, purchasing, and related costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Alliance also allows Renault and Nissan to tackle projects such as electric vehicles, the cost of which would be prohibitive if each company had to bear it separately. As is, both companies have invested €4 billion (almost $5 billion) into research and development and the manufacturing of vehicles and batteries. Renault now sells three models of electric car: the two-seat (with in-line seat configuration) Twizy; the five-seat Zoe; and the Kangoo, a van (Nissan's Leaf model is the world's top-selling electric passenger vehicle).
  </p>
  <p>
   The Renault-Nissan Alliance is making a tandem expansion into emerging countries such as Russia, India, and Brazil. In an attempt to get a larger piece of the growing car market in India, Renault has made a point of introducing a steady stream of new models there. To get a larger chunk of the rapidly growing Russian car market, Renault-Nissan forged an alliance with Russian carmaker
   <company id="99107">
    AvtoVAZ
   </company>
   . Renault holds about 50% of the company and has invested heavily in upgrading its production plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   Renault is pushing into China, and in 2016 established a production base in Wuhan with the support of Dongfeng, Nissan's Chinese partner.

  <p>
   In the Paris suburb of Billancourt in 1898, 21-year-old Louis Renault assembled a motorized vehicle with a transmission box of his own design. Louis and his brothers, Marcel and Fernand, established Renault Freres and produced the world's first sedan in 1899. Marcel died in a racing accident (1903) and Fernand left the business (1908), leaving Louis in sole possession of the company. He renamed it La Société Louis Renault in 1908.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1914 a fleet of 600 Paris taxis shuttled French troops to fight the Germans in the Battle of the Marne. Renault also built light tanks and airplane engines. Between world wars Renault expanded into trucks, tractors, and aircraft engines. Renault sustained heavy damage in WWII, but Louis Renault operated the remaining Paris facilities for the Germans during their occupation of France. After the liberation of Paris, he was accused of collaboration and died in prison while awaiting trial in 1944. The de Gaulle government nationalized Renault in 1945 and gave the company its present name.
  </p>
  <p>
   Worldwide economic growth aided Renault's postwar comeback. The company achieved its greatest success in high-volume, low-cost cars such as the 4 CV in the late 1940s and 1950s, the Renault 4 in the 1960s and 1970s, and the Renault 5 in the 1970s and 1980s.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1979 Renault acquired 46% of American Motors Corporation (AMC). In the early 1980s AMC fared poorly, and Renault suffered from a worldwide slump in auto sales, an aging product line, and stiff competition from Japanese carmakers. Decreasing sales, an unwieldy bureaucracy, and above-average wages contributed to a $1.5 billion loss in 1984.
  </p>
  <p>
   Georges Besse took over Renault in 1985 and trimmed employment by 20,000. When Besse was assassinated by Red Army Faction terrorists in 1986, Raymond Levy assumed his role and continued his policies, laying off 30,000 more workers and selling AMC to Chrysler (1987).
  </p>
  <p>
   Renault and
   <company id="41854">
    AB Volvo
   </company>
   agreed to extensive cross-ownership and cooperation in 1990. In 1994 Renault swapped its 25% stake in Volvo's car division for the latter's 45% stake in Renault's troubled truck unit. (Volvo sold its remaining 11% stake in 1997.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The French government reduced its share of the firm from 80% to 52% in 1995 and to 44% the following year. In 1997 it shut down a Belgian plant that employed more than 3,000 workers and fired a similar number of employees in France. Renault paid a $13 million civil penalty to the
   <company id="130205">
    EPA
   </company>
   in 1998 to settle allegations that its
   <company id="43929">
    Mack Trucks
   </company>
   unit cheated on its diesel engine emissions tests.
  </p>
  <p>
   Renault and
   <company id="41777">
    Fiat
   </company>
   struck several deals in 1999. They combined their bus-making operations under the name Irisbus and their foundry operations into jointly owned Teksid. Renault sold a 51% stake in Renault Automation to Fiat's
   <company id="91670">
    Comau
   </company>
   robotics unit. Also that year Renault bought a 51% stake in Romanian automaker Automobile Dacia SA, and paid $5.4 billion for a 37% stake in
   <company id="41879">
    Nissan
   </company>
   and a 15% (later increased to 23%) stake in truck affiliate Nissan Diesel Motor.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2000 the company announced that it would spend around $100 million to build an SUV factory in Brazil and announced plans to trim almost $3 billion in costs between 2001 and 2003. The same year Renault agreed to buy a 70% stake in Samsung Motors' automobile business for around $550 million. It also sold its Mack truck unit to Volvo in exchange for a 15% stake in the Swedish truck maker. Renault planned to buy another 5% of Volvo on the open market. Renault and Nissan also announced plans to save about $1 billion by combining their European sales and marketing operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Renault sold its Renault V.I. subsidiary and its Mack Trucks unit to Volvo in return for a 20% stake in the Swedish truck maker.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2001 Renault furthered strengthen ties with Nissan. The plan increased Renault's stake in Nissan to 44% while granting Nissan a 15% stake in Renault. The French Finance Ministry also announced that it would reduce the French government's stake in Renault from 44% to 25% through a public offering. The two deals were completed in 2002. In 2003 the French government further reduced its stake in Renault from 25% to about 15%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2005 Renault sold its 18% stake in Nissan Diesel Motor Co., Ltd. to
   <company id="121104">
    J.P. Morgan Securities, Ltd.
   </company>
   , who, in turn, sold the shares on the open market.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year Renault called an emergency board meeting to ponder a proposal put forth in writing by billionaire General Motors investor Kirk Kerkorian (he owned about a 10% stake in GM at the time). Kerkorian suggested GM, Renault, and Nissan form a three-way global automotive alliance, but the parties decided otherwise and announced at the Paris Auto Show in 2006 that no such alliance would be formed.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Carlos Ghosn was appointed as CEO; he also remained as CEO with Nissan. Ghosn had been Renault's chief cost cutter since 1999. Ghosn made public his plans to revamp Renault by slashing the number of suppliers, close five plants, and cut its workforce by 14%. While not in the same precarious position as its North American counterparts Chrysler, Ford, and GM, Renault's 2005 profits fell by more than 35% from the previous year and its lineup of products is growing stale.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Renault formed a car manufacturing joint venture with India's
   <company id="138817">
    Mahindra &amp; Mahindra
   </company>
   , which produced the no-frills, midsized Logan model sedan. In 2010 Renault sold its 49% interest in the venture to Mahindra, but continued to supply key engine and transmission components. Sales of the Logan never reached expected levels, and Renault stated it would rather focus on more profitable alliances in the region, including its Renault-Nissan alliance.
