   , beans are beans, and Goya's got 'em. Goya Foods produces more than 2,200 Hispanic and Caribbean grocery items, including canned and dried beans, canned meats, beverages, cooking oils, and olives. Its product portfolio also offers rice, seasonings and sauces, plantain and yucca chips, ready meals, and frozen treats and entrees. Goya sells many rice styles and about 30 types of beans and peas under the Goya and Canilla brand names. The company's beverages include tropical fruit nectars, juices, tropical sodas, and coffee. Goya is owned and operated by one of the wealthiest Hispanic

   in the US -- the Unanues -- who founded the company in 1936.

   The company boasts about 15 factories and a dozen distribution centers located in the US, the Caribbean, and Spain. Goya Foods continues to increase its product line and invest in improvements in production and expansion throughout the US. It has increased distribution and production capacity in the markets it serves, particularly in Texas, Virginia, Spain, Puerto Rico, Massachusetts, New York, and Chicago. Goya has added distribution facilities in Illinois and New Jersey, enabling the company to increase its presence in the Midwest and parts of the Mid- and South Atlantic regions. In a move to increase its global sales, Goya's Spanish operation has expanded olive oil production lines and has begun distributing Goya products in Spain, as well as the rest of Europe.

   From its headquarters in Seacaucus, New Jersey, Goya serves up Caribbean, Mexican, and South and Central American fare to consumers worldwide through several strategically located offices in the US, as well as in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Spain.

   The company saw a boost from the country's economic woes as consumers cooked more meals at home and ventured into cooking ethnic cuisines. Goya still faces stiff competition from food giants, such as Kraft Foods, which market lines of Hispanic specialty products. It's also challenged by food manufacturers located in Mexico, who are now turning north to tap the pocketbooks of US consumers. Food retailers carrying Goya products in the US include Wal-Mart, H-E-B, Soriana, Chedraui, and Casa Ley.

  <p>
   Goya is one of the largest Hispanic-owned companies in the US. It has historically served the Hispanic communities in the northeastern US and Florida, having mostly Cuban, Dominican, and Puerto Rican customers. The company now has products geared toward the tastes of Hispanics in California and the Southwest who have roots in Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America. An added plus is that the growing taste for ethnic foods across the US has fueled Goya's growth beyond its Hispanic roots. And to its benefit, its "all-in-one-aisle" product placement in food stores has proven to be successful.
  </p>
  <p>
   To meet rising demand for its products and support its growing business, Goya opened a $127-million regional distribution center and headquarters in Jersey City, New Jersey in fall 2014. The company has outgrown its long-established warehouse in nearby Seacaucus. The new facility measures 638,000 square feet. Three other manufacturing and distribution facilities -- in Atlanta, Houston, and Los Angeles -- in addition to the Jersey City site have either opened or are also slated to open. (The Houston site opened in March 2014.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Strategically, Goya tailors its products to specific Hispanic markets to set itself apart from rivals. For example, in Miami it emphasizes Cuban food; in Texas it offers Mexican-style products. Attending to immigration patterns, it has introduced more foods popular in Central America, in keeping with the growth of that population in the US.

  <p>
   Immigrants from Spain by way of Puerto Rico, husband and wife Prudencio Unanue and Carolina Casal founded Unanue &amp; Sons in New York City in 1936. The couple imported sardines, olives, and olive oil from Spain, but when the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) interrupted supply lines, they began importing foods from Morocco.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1949 the company established a cannery in Puerto Rico; the Puerto Rican imports were distributed to local immigrants from the West Indies. Each of the couple's four sons eventually joined the family business, and in 1958 the firm relocated to Brooklyn. The company took its current name, Goya Foods, in 1962 when the family bought the Goya name -- originally a brand of sardines -- for $1.
  </p>
  <p>
   The oldest Unanue son, CEO Charles, was fired from Goya in 1969 -- and subsequently cut out of Prudencio's will -- when he spoke out about an alleged tax evasion scheme. (Legal wrangling between Charles and the rest of the family continued into the late 1990s.) Goya moved to its present New Jersey headquarters in 1974.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company celebrated its 70th year in business and opened an online e-store. Goya began distributing about 40 of its products in major Mexican cities, including Guadalajara, Monterrey, and Mexico City two years later. The move marked the first time the company entered the Mexican food market.
