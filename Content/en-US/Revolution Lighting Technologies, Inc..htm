   Because you can't have a revolution without light. Revolution Lighting Technologies (formerly Nexxus Lighting) designs, produces, and sells light-emitting diode (LED) replacement light bulbs. Its products, which include multiple-color temperatures and optic/lens options, are marketed for their energy savings, improved lighting and reliability, as well as eco-friendly benefits. It also makes Hyperion R-Lite and Lumeon 360, LED-based signage systems for decorative lighting strips, through subsidiary Lumificient Corp. In late 2012 Nexxus Lighting changed its name to Revolution Lighting Technologies to reflect what it believes is the new change taking place -- LED technology -- in the lighting industry.

   Customers typically have heavy lighting requirements, such as commercial, entertainment, institutional, and retail locations; the US represents about 80% of sales.

  <p>
   Looking ahead, Revolution Lighting Technologies is working to enhance its lighting portfolio, as well as develop new products to expand its range of customer applications. Investment in engineering and product development increased more than 70% in 2010. The company holds more than 30 issued patents (and nearly 30 pending US and foreign patent applications) safeguarding the Array and Lumificient lines.

  <p>
   The company's history traces back to when it was called Super Vision International. In 2007 it changed to its current name and relocated its corporate headquarters. In 2009 and 2010 the company reorganized its operating segments. As part of the initiative, Nexxus closed a plant in Minnesota and transferred production to Florida, and to other third-party manufacturers.
