   General Mills is one of the world's top brass cereal makers. Every year it jockeys with
   <company id="10841">
    Kellogg
   </company>
   to be #1 in that market with a brand arsenal that includes kid-friendly Kix, as well as Chex, Cheerios, Lucky Charms, and Wheaties. Much more than a cereal maker, General Mills is one of the world's largest food companies. Some of its #1 and #2 market-leading brands include Betty Crocker dessert mixes, Gold Medal flour, Green Giant vegetables, Pillsbury cookie dough, and Yoplait yogurt. While most of the firm's sales come from the US, General Mills is working to extend the reach and position of its brands globally. It picked up natural foods maker
   <company id="52771">
    Annie's
   </company>
   in 2014 and premium meat snack maker EPIC Provisions in 2016.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   General Mills sells its products in more than 100 countries throughout North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia. The US is its largest market, accounting for 72% of sales. Europe is next, contributing about 12%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to its consolidated operations, the company has a 50% stake in two strategic joint ventures that manufacture and market food products sold in more than 130 countries worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates 59 facilities for the production of a wide variety of food products. Of these facilities, 30 are located in the US (1 of which is leased), 6 in the Asia/Pacific region (2 of which are leased), 4 in Canada (2 of which are leased), 10 in Europe/Australia, and 9 in South and Central America and Mexico.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company boasts offices and manufacturing facilities in more than 30 countries. It divides its business into three segments. The majority of the firm's sales come from US Retail, which includes seven US-focused divisions that market Big G cereals like Cheerios, packaged meals such as Hamburger Helper, the Pillsbury and Yoplait brands, snacks like Nature Valley granola bars, baking products such as Betty Crocker, and
   <company id="130888">
    Small Planet Foods
   </company>
   , a subsidiary that offers organic brands Cascadian Farm and Muir Glen.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through wholly-owned businesses outside of the US, General Mills' International segment sells certain brands and products in Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia. Among them are Cheerios, Green Giant, Häagen-Dazs ice cream, Old El Paso Mexican foods, Pillsbury, Wanchai Ferry dumplings, Yoplait, and Yoki flour in Brazil (which was acquired in mid-2012 in a deal that doubled General Mills' annual sales in Latin America). The company also offers some local brands, including La Salteña pastas and tapas in Brazil and Jus-Rol in the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   General Mills' smallest business segment, Convenience Stores &amp; Foodservice, delivers baking mixes and flour to bakeries and grocery store bakeries; branded cereals, snacks, backed goods, and yogurt to schools, restaurants, and hotels; and a variety of products to convenience stores and vending machines.
  </p>
  <p>
   General Mills also owns interest in two joint ventures: Cereal Partners Worldwide with
   <company id="41815">
    Nestlé
   </company>
   (which sells such breakfast cereals as Chocapic, Nesquick, Shreddies, and Uncle Toby's) and Häagen-Dazs Japan (which operates ice cream cafés in that country).
  </p>
  <p>
   U.S. Retail accounted for about 60% of the company's net sales in fiscal 2016 (May year end) and the International segment, 28%. The remainder was accounted for by Convenience Stores &amp; Foodservice.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's primary customers include grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership club stores, natural food chains, commercial and non-commercial foodservice distributors and operators, as well as restaurants, convenience stores, and drug, dollar, and discount chains.
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   , which accounted for 20% of the company's net sales in fiscal 2016, is General Mills' largest customer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advertising and media expenses for the behemoth food maker lingers around the $900 million mark. Indeed, in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, General Mills logged $754.4 million, $823.1 million, and $869.5 million, respectively, in getting its name out.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 General Mills net sales declined by 6% due to a 4% drop from foreign currency exchange rates related to re-measurement as a result of the value of the US dollar over other currencies; the sale of the Green Giant vegetable business in North America; and a 52-week year (compared to a 53-week in fiscal 2015). Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net sales declined by 2% in fiscal 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net sales for the International segment declined by 10%, reflecting negative foreign currency translation effects. On a constant currency basis, International net sales increased 3%. Net sales grew by 12% in Latin America, with a good performance in Brazil, including the acquisition of Carolina yogurt in that market. Sales rose by 3% in Europe thanks to growth on Old El Paso Mexican products and Häagen-Dazs ice cream. Asia/Pacific revenues went up  by 1%, led by double-digit sales growth in India. Net sales declined by 4% in Canada, driven by the divestiture of the Green Giant vegetable business in that market.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has recorded net income growth over the last five years.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income increased by 39% in fiscal 2016 due to lower restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs, and s gain from divestitures.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities grew by 3% due to a $477 million increase in net earnings (including a $96 million change in deferred income taxes and a $148 million net gain on divestitures) also offset by a $424 million decrease in non-cash restructuring charges. The $43 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by the timing of accounts payable including the impact of longer terms offset by the timing of inventory build.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Beyond acquisitions, General Mills is looking to new products for growth. The food giant regularly launches dozens of new products across its diverse portfolio each fiscal year. Past additions include Green Giant Veggie Chips, Totino's Pizzeria Rolls, and GoGurt Twisted, among many others. General Mill's brand-building strategy involves developing new value-added products and building its brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing and innovative merchandising programs.
  </p>
  <p>
   It introduced the Annie's organic brand to new categories, including yogurt, soup and cereal. In fiscal 2017, the company plans to  continue to innovate on its brands to drive sales growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   To reshape its portfolio General Mills is acquiring and divesting products to increase the growth profile of its businesses. It is also getting its brands into the fastest- growing outlets where people buy food and expanding into new geographies to reach more consumers around the world. The company is currently pursuing several multi-year restructuring initiatives designed to increase efficiency and focus on key growth strategies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Building its international business is another key element of the company's strategy. Indeed, in fiscal 2016 General Mills' international arm contributed 28% of the company's total sales, up from 19% in fiscal 2011. The company has been increasing their global footprint by acquiring new brands in international markets and expanding their current brands into more markets around the world. A great example is the recent introduction of Yoplait yogurt in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also sells under-performing assets to raise cash and cut costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016, General Mills approved Project Compass, a restructuring plan designed to enable the International segment to accelerate long-term growth through increased organizational effectiveness and reduced administrative expense. The company also made the decision to close its manufacturing facility in Vineland, New Jersey; reached a tentative agreement to sell its Martel, Ohio, facility to Mennel Milling Company; agreed to close the Marília manufacturing facility and distribution center; and transfer production out of the São Bernardo do Campo facility to other General Mills facilities in Brazil. It also decided to exit the fruit snacks business in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 it sold its Green Giant and Le Sueur frozen and canned vegetables businesses to
   <company id="60245">
    B&amp;G Foods
   </company>
   for about $765 million. The sale comes as General Mills struggles with weakness in some of its top brands; Green Giant itself is considered a brand in somewhat of a decline as consumers increasingly desire fresh produce over the frozen and canned variety.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, General Mills also announced a preliminary decision to exit its foodservice business in South Africa and close its facility in Linbro Park, Johannesburg. It also closed its frozen dough manufacturing facility in Kaohsiung, Taiwan and approved plans to close one of its two facilities in Joplin, Missouri, and its refrigerated baked goods plant in Midland, Ontario, Canada and New Albany, Indiana. In fiscal 2014 its sold certain grain elevators in the US.Retail segment for $124 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 General Mills inaugurated the company's first innovation, technology and quality center in China. The $15 million facility, spanning 75,000 square feet, was the company's first major technical center outside of the General Mills worldwide headquarters in Minneapolis.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   General Mills also has an eye on the growing natural foods niche.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 it bought EPIC Provisions, a rapidly growing, premium meat snacks company based in Austin, Texas. EPIC will operate under General Mills' Annie's business. EPIC will maintain its present location in Austin. The acquisition of EPIC positions General Mills for exciting growth with a highly authentic brand in an entirely new natural snacking category.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company acquired Brazilian yogurt maker Carolina Administração e Participações Societárias Ltda., (Carolina), a privately-held dairy products company headquartered in Ribeirão Claro, Paraná, Brazil. Carolina is a family-owned Brazilian company, a dairy products producer. Carolina's strong capabilities in yogurt and dairy were targeted to accelerate General Mills' growth in Brazil.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company bought
   <company id="52771">
    Annie's
   </company>
   , a top US maker of branded organic and natural food products for $46 per share in cash, representing a value of about $820 million. Annie's, founded in 1989, has grown from a producer of organic mac and cheese and bunny-shaped crackers to a bustling business that boasts product categories that compete successfully with heavy hitters in the food business.
  </p>

  <p>
   Cadwallader Washburn built his first flour mill in 1866 in Minneapolis, which eventually became the Washburn Crosby Company. After winning a gold medal for flour at an 1880 exposition, the company changed the name of its best flour to Gold Medal Flour.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1921 advertising manager Sam Gale created fictional spokeswoman Betty Crocker so that correspondence to housewives could go out with her signature. The firm introduced Wheaties cereal in 1924. James Bell, named president in 1925, consolidated the company with other US mills in 1928 to form General Mills, the world's largest miller. The companies operated independently of one another, with corporate headquarters coordinating advertising and merchandising.
  </p>
  <p>
   General Mills began introducing convenience foods such as Bisquick (1931) and Cheerios (1941). During WWII it produced war goods such as ordnance equipment and developed chemical and electronics divisions.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Edwin Rawlings became CEO in 1961, he closed half of the flour mills and divested such unprofitable lines as electronics. This cost $200 million in annual sales but freed resources for such acquisitions as Kenner Products (toys, 1967) and Parker Brothers (board games, 1968), which made General Mills the world's largest toy company.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the next 20 years the company made many acquisitions, including Gorton's (frozen seafood, 1968), Monet (jewelry, 1968),
   <company id="105303">
    Eddie Bauer
   </company>
   (outerwear, 1971), and
   <company id="16494">
    The Talbots
   </company>
   (women's clothing, 1973). It bought
   <company id="111539">
    Red Lobster
   </company>
   in 1970 and acquired the US rights to Yoplait yogurt in 1977. When the toy and fashion divisions' profits fell in 1984, they were spun off as Kenner Parker Toys and Crystal Brands (1985). Reemphasizing food in 1989, the firm sold many businesses, including Eddie Bauer and Talbots.
  </p>
  <p>
   To expand into Europe, General Mills struck two important joint ventures: Cereal Partners Worldwide (with
   <company id="41815">
    Nestlé
   </company>
   in 1989) and Snack Ventures Europe (with
   <company id="11166">
    PepsiCo
   </company>
   in 1992).
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of a cereal price war, in 1994 the company cut coupon promotion costs by $175 million and lowered prices on many cereals. But some retailers did not pass on the price cuts to consumers due to shortages that developed after the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   found an unauthorized pesticide in some cereals. General Mills destroyed 55 million boxes of cereal at a cost of $140 million. Stephen Sanger became CEO in 1995. That year the company sold Gortons to
   <company id="41850">
    Unilever
   </company>
   and spun off its restaurant businesses as
   <company id="43598">
    Darden Restaurants
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Focused on a food-only future, in the late 1990s General Mills picked up several smaller businesses, including
   <company id="41956">
    Ralcorp Holdings
   </company>
   ' Chex snack and cereal lines and Gardetto's Bakery snack mixes, as well as the North American rights to Olibra, an appetite suppressant food additive made by
   <company id="93813">
    Scotia Holdings
   </company>
   . Entering the natural foods market in 2000, General Mills launched Sunrise organic cereal and bought organic foods producer
   <company id="130888">
    Small Planet Foods
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Big changes came in 2001 when General Mills became the #1 cereal maker in the US, overtaking Kellogg for the first time since 1906. The company then completed its $10.5 billion purchase of Pillsbury from
   <company id="55181">
    Diageo
   </company>
   in October 2001. A month later General Mills sold competing product lines to
   <company id="10799">
    International Multifoods
   </company>
   . Also that year the company launched a 50-50 joint venture with
   <company id="10487">
    DuPont
   </company>
   to develop soy beverages marketed under the 8th Continent brand name. While busily integrating Pillsbury, in 2002 General Mills saw its income fall and watched as Kellogg regained the lead in the cereal market. In 2003 the
   <company id="56705">
    SEC
   </company>
   began an investigation into the company's sales and accounting practices (which it terminated in 2005, taking no action against General Mills).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 General Mills filed a universal shelf registration with the SEC, the result of which is that Diageo had to register the common shares of General Mills that it owns before it could sell those shares in a public offering. Also as a result of the shelf registration, two Diageo-designated members of General Mills' board (including Diageo CEO Paul Walsh) resigned as a result of a change in the two companies' stockholders agreement that terminated Diageo's right to designate two General Mills' board members. Diageo sold part of its approximate 20% stake in General Mills. General Mills, in turn, sold an $835 million stake to an affiliate of
   <company id="41936">
    Lehman Brothers Holding
   </company>
   and used $750 million to buy back the Diageo shares and $85 million to pay down debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2004 the company sold its US Häagen-Dazs ice cream shop franchise business to
   <company id="13233">
    Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream
   </company>
   . In 2005 it sold its stake in Snack Ventures Europe joint venture to
   <company id="11166">
    PepsiCo
   </company>
   for $750 million. That year the company introduced Yoplait Healthy Heart, which contains cholesterol-lowering plant sterols.
  </p>
  <p>
   Diageo sold two-thirds of its 20% stake in General Mills in 2005. Later that year, General Mills announced the sale of Lloyd's barbecue business to
   <company id="11977">
    Hormel Foods
   </company>
   . In 2006 Cereal Partners Worldwide (its joint venture with
   <company id="41815">
    Nestlé
   </company>
   ) acquired the Australian breakfast cereal operations of Uncle Tobys from
   <company id="53766">
    Burns Philp
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   After more than 10 years of being ignored, the Jolly Green Giant came out of retirement in 2005 as part of a multi-million dollar marketing campaign by General Mills to up its veggie sales. The next year, General Mills declined to renew its licensing agreement with
   <company id="10124">
    Archer Daniels Midland
   </company>
   regarding the sale and marketing of Pillsbury Bakery Flour to the industrial and foodservice sectors. General Mills integrated the brand, which consists of mixes and frozen bakery products, into its bakery ingredients segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to develop healthier products, in 2006 the company entered a supply agreement for DHA (an omega-3 fatty acid said to play a role in mental and cardiovascular health) with
   <company id="16687">
    Martek Biosciences
   </company>
   , maker of DHA (which is already widely used in infant formula).
  </p>
  <p>
   General Mills pulled its reduced-sugar children's cereal from the market in 2007 due to poor sales. Sweetened with
   <company id="42402">
    SPLENDA
   </company>
   , the cereals never took off with consumers, perhaps due to resistance to the sugar replacement. (Kellogg and
   <company id="103392">
    Kraft
   </company>
   use sugar in their reduced-sugar cereal offerings.) That year the company acquired UK chilled pastry company, Saxby Bros.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2007 CEO Sanger stepped down. President and COO Ken Powell replaced him. The following year, General Mills and
   <company id="10487">
    DuPont
   </company>
   sold their soy-milk joint venture,
   <company id="139206">
    8th Continent
   </company>
   , to
   <company id="47547">
    Stremicks Heritage Foods
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   To better focus on its core brands and foodservice offerings, the company in mid-2010 sold its Delicity chain of bakeries in Argentina to Tentissimo Group, which also operates restaurants under the Tentissimo banner in the country. The deal included the Delicity brand, five company-owned bakeries, and franchiser rights, which apply to the roughly 55 bakery locations operated by franchisees. General Mills also agreed to continue supplying dough products to the chain. It had owned Delicity since acquiring Pillsbury in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company sold its Pop·Secret operations to
   <company id="100917">
    Diamond Foods
   </company>
   for some $190 million in cash. Pop·Secret is the second-largest-selling branded popcorn in the US, after Orville Redenbacher, which is made by
   <company id="10388">
    ConAgra
   </company>
   . (ConAgra also makes Act II microwaveable popcorn.) While General Mills said it is concentrating its efforts on increasing the sales of its more lucrative core brands, the high price of corn most probably also figured into the decision to jettison Pop·Secret.
  </p>
  <p>
   General Mills made no divestures in 2009 but in 2010 the company ceased making Perfect Portions refrigerated biscuits and exited the kids' refrigerated yogurt beverage and microwave soup segments in its US retail operations; internationally, it also stopped the manufacture of foodservice breadcrumbs with the sale of its Brazilian bread and pasta plant for $6 million. These product cessations were made in response to its declining financial results, particularly in its international segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   To better focus on its retail sales channels, in late 2010 General Mills sold its Croissant King (acquired in 2005) and van den Bergh's (acquired in 1999) frozen bakery business in Australia to Ireland's
   <company id="91314">
    Kerry Group
   </company>
   . The sale includes frozen dough and pastry products sold to professional bakers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following that divestiture, General Mills in 2011 acquired Australia's Pasta Master, a maker of chilled Italian meals, pasta, and sauces. The purchase, valued at nearly $40 million, broadened General Mills' ready-to-cook pasta offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   To help offset weakness in its core cereal business, General Mills is beefing up its yogurt empire through acquisitions, such as its $1.2 billion purchase of a controlling stake in Yoplait in 2011, a brand that it had licensed for several decades. The company acquired the 50% stake in Yoplait owned by French investment firm
   <company id="133849">
    PAI Partners
   </company>
   , plus 1% from dairy cooperative Social. Additionally, General Mills acquired a 50% share of a related firm that owns Yoplait's global branding rights. General Mills aims to expand Yoplait's operations in France, Europe, and the rest of the world. Also in 2011 General Mills acquired Dean Foods' Mountain High all-natural yogurt business for about $85 million. The brand became part of General Mills' Yoplait USA division.
  </p>
  <p>
   In line with its strategy to grow its business in global markets, General Mills acquired Parampara's ready-to-cook spice and sauce mixes made and marketed in India and also exported to the US, Canada, and Japan. In 2012 it bought Brazilian food maker Yoki Alimentos, which makes and markets more than 600 items under nine brands, including Yoki and Kitano. The deal doubles General Mills' annual sales in Latin America.
