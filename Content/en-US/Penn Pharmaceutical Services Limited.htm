   Because big pharmaceutical companies can't do all of their own research and manufacturing, PCI Pharma Services (formerly Penn Pharmaceutical Services) is ready to help out. PCI Pharma offers a variety of products and services, including clinical trial supplies; formulation and analytical development; chemistry, limited batch manufacturing, and controls (CMC) consultancy; and qualified person (QP) audits. The company's facilities provide contract services for small- to medium-batch manufacturing. PCI Pharma also offers logistical management services, such as exporting and reporting. Packaging Coordinators Inc. (PCI) acquired Penn Pharmaceutical Services for Â£127 million in mid-2014.

   A year after the acquisition, PCI rebranded Penn Pharmaceutical Services as PCI Pharma Services, integrating other acquired firms (including AndersonBrecon and Biotec Services International) into a single entity.

   Penn Pharmaceutical was originally established with support from the Welsh Development Agency. Management took the company private in 2007 with buyout assistance from Lloyds Development Capital.
