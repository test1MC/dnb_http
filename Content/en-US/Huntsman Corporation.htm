  <p>
   In 2015 net revenues decreased by 11% due to declines in all segments except for Pigments and Additives.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues in Polyurethanes segment decreased due to a planned maintenance outage at PO/MTBE facility in Port Neches, Texas; lower MDI due to the market slowdown in China; and lower sales into commercial construction in the US. It was also hurt by the stronger US dollar.
  </p>
  <p>
   The decrease in revenues in Performance Products segment was primarily due to lower average selling prices and lower sales volumes. Sales volumes decreased across most product lines, including the effect of the sale of European commodity surfactants business partially offset by higher toll volumes in upstream intermediates business.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Advanced Materials segment revenue drop was due to lower sales volumes and lower average selling prices. Sales volumes decreased globally primarily in coatings and construction and transportation and industrial markets due to the deselection of certain business and competitive pressure, partially offset by strong volume growth in do-it-yourself and wind markets in the Asia/Pacific region.
  </p>
  <p>
   The decrease in revenues in Textile Effects segment was due to lower average selling prices and lower sales volumes. Sales volumes decreased primarily due to the deselection of certain less profitable business and challenging market conditions.
  </p>
  <p>

  <p>
   The company's business strategy focuses on the three major markets -- apparel, home, and institutional and technical textiles.
  </p>
  <p>
   Huntsman's strategy is to increase sales to its current customers while seeking growth in emerging international markets such as India and China. Huntsman has relocated the headquarters of some of its divisions overseas to be closer to critical markets, putting its Polyurethanes operation in Hong Kong and its Textile Effects unit in Singapore. Huntsman has also expanded its manufacturing capabilities overseas by expanding its current operations and acquiring other companies. The company believes that by integrating its different product operations in large facilities close to its customers, it can cut transportation costs and exposure to cyclical prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the company continued its restructuring activities that include workforce reduction in Europe. The Performance Products segment announced plans for a reorganization of its commercial and technical functions and a refocused divisional business strategy to better position the segment for growth in coming years. It also planned to close the 'black end' manufacturing operations and ancillary activities at its Calais, France site, reducing titanium dioxide capacity.

  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company saved nearly $100 million via initiative include relocating manufacturing from Europe to countries such as Thailand and China, where many of its customers are expanding.
