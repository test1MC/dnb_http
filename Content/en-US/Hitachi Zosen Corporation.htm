   Everything is better on a Hitz. One of Japan's top industrial machinery and infrastructure construction groups, Hitachi Zosen -- or Hitz -- operates through several primary divisions. Environmental Systems and Industrial Plants make waste incineration and recycling plants, sludge treatment, and desalination plants. Its Machinery and Process Equipment units make turbines, boilers, diesel engines, incineration facilities, and power generation facilities. Other segments construct bridges and make tunneling machinery, remote tsunami monitoring stations and GPS warning systems.

  <p>
   Hitz has operations in Japan, Taiwan, China, Bangkok, Korea, Singapore, Europe, India, and the US. It sells its products worldwide, and the company has manufactured and installed over 440 waste incineration facilities. Japan accounts for 75% of the company's total sales.

  <p>
   Hitachi Zosen's strategy for growth revolves around the key industries of green energy, social infrastructure, and disaster prevention. It has its sights on markets overseas, notably in emerging nations, as well as leading-edge business fields.

  <p>
   The company also enters joint ventures and opens offices in emerging markets in order to extend its geographic footprint. In 2012 it established a joint corporation with ISGEC Heavy Engineering (named ISGEC Hitachi Zosen Ltd.), in the Indian state of Gujarat, to respond to the demand for process equipment for shale gas development.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Hitachi Zosen acquired NAC International, a nuclear fuel cycle management company focused on the engineering and transportation of casks and canisters. The deal gave Hitz the ability to provide a 'one-stop' service for the management of spent nuclear fuel, including consulting, engineering, manufacturing, and transportation services.
