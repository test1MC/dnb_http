   Having earned market share in every region in the country, Edsal Manufacturing has worked to maintain its "made in the USA" business philosophy by not sending jobs overseas to reduce overhead. The company continues to employ more than 500 unionized workers and has been able to hire others who have worked for competitors that no longer have local production.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to its emphasis on US-based operations, the company has noted that its build quality and environmental stewardship exceed the efforts of its overseas rivals. Indeed, the company typically makes its products using more than 50% recycled materials. To boot, Edsal says the prices of its products are comparable, and sometimes lower, than those made abroad.
