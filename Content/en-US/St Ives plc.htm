   As I was going to St Ives I met a...marketing services group? St Ives plc is an international marketing services group comprising 16 marketing and print services businesses. The commercial printing firm operates through three business segments. Its Marketing Activation segment delivers marketing communications through a combination of print and in-store marketing services. The Strategic Marketing segment includes the group's Data, Digital and Insight businesses. The Books segment comprises Clays and through it St. Ives has printed books from the wildly successful
   <em>
    Harry Potter
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Twilight
   </em>
   series.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
        <p>
   St Ives operates 16 marketing and print services businesses across five fields: data, consulting, digital, marketing activation, and books.
  </p>
        <p>
   The data group consists of Occam, Amaze One, Bench, and Response One. Consulting comprises Pragma, FSP Retail, Incite, and Hive. Digital comprises Amaze, Branded3, Realise, Solstice, and The App Business. Marketing Activation companies include SIMS, Service graphics, SP Group, and Tactical Solutions.
  </p>
        <p>
   Clays is St Ives' only company working in its Books segment; books and printing is something of a legacy concern for St Ives.
  </p>
        <p>
   Marketing Activation accounts for more than 40% of sales, Strategic Marketing around 38%, and books nearly 20%.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Despite its name, St Ives isn't based in the tip of Cornwall but in London. It also has other offices in the UK, North America, China, and Singapore. The UK accounts for 85% of sales, and the US 10%.

   In fiscal 2016, revenue grew 7% to £367.5 million, mostly down to contributions from acquisitions. Strategic marketing grew 30% (of which 11pp was organic and 19pp acquisitive) and Books grew 3% to £68.6 million, while Marketing Activation fell 7% to £154.8 million. Marketing Activation suffered as a result of a reduction in promotional activity in the retail grocery market.
  </p>
        <p>
   St Ives recorded net loss in 2016 of £8.1 million, versus net income of £5.6 million in 2015. The loss came from a surge in administrative expenses relating to redundancies in the Books segment, the restructuring cost of merging former Print Services into Marketing Activation, empty property costs, and loss on the sale of property, plant, and equipment in Bradford and Birmingham.
  </p>
        <p>
   Cash from operating activities fell 45% to £14.5 million.

        <p>
   St Ives' Marketing Activation segment is struggling, and in the last year the company has issued two severe profit warnings, leading to a collapse in its share price. As a result, St Ives is undertaking cost-cutting and diversification to mitigate its overreliance on the grocery market.
  </p>
        <p>
   St Ives is a fairly acquisitive company, and indeed somewhat relies on acquisitions for revenue growth. In both 2016 and 2015, the majority of revenue growth came from businesses acquired in the year. In 2016 and 2015, it bought out two mobile-led product development consultancy firms, The App Business and Solstice Consulting. Both were acquired for around £25 million, and help St Ives deepen its mobile and customer engagement and loyalty capabilities.

        <p>
   In 2016, St Ives acquired The App Business, a London-based mobile-led consultancy firm specializing in strategy, product development, and business transformation. The price of the acquisition was £25 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2015, the company made a similar acquisition in Solstice Consulting LLC, a Chicago-based digital consultancy specializing in mobile­-first digital product design and engineering services, for £24.7 million.
