   SAFT (Société des Accumulateurs Fixes et de Traction) has watched over the past century as batteries developed from nickel to lithium and suddenly became cool. The company designs and manufactures industrial and specialty batteries for high-tech use. SAFT batteries are used in passenger rail cars, aircraft, military vessels, hybrid vehicles, power grids, telecom networks, and renewable energy applications. Its specialty battery segment makes lithium and rechargeable lithium-ion batteries for the electronics, defense, and space industries. In mid-2016 French oil giant

   Two Swiss electrochemists founded Société des Accumulateurs Fixes et de Traction (SAFT) in 1918 to manufacture and distribute nickel-based batteries for industrial uses. The company was quoted on the Paris bourse in 1924 and acquired by a predecessor of Alcatel in 1928.
