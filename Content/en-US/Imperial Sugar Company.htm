   In a rather sweet position, Imperial Sugar is one of the biggest processors and marketers of refined sugar in the US. Its white, brown, and powdered sugars are sold to retailers under name brands -- Dixie Crystals, Holly, and Imperial -- and under private labels. Most refined sugar, which generates most of the company's sales, is sold domestically in bulk and liquid form to industrial markets (mainly food manufacturers of baked goods, desserts, and beverages) and foodservice and industrial distributors, that sell the sugar to manufacturers, restaurants, and institutional foodservice customers. Imperial Sugar has been owned by a subsidiary of
   <company id="110766">
    Louis Dreyfus Commodities
   </company>
   (LDC) since 2012.

  <p>

   in mid-2012 promptly completed its tender offer (launched in May) for Imperial's shares priced at $6.35, a 57% premium to the closing price on April 30, 2012. The sale came after the sugar company suffered a $53.4 million loss in fiscal 2011 on more than a 5% and 20% decline in year-over-year sugar sales and volumes, respectively. Results were driven by lower margins hit by volatile and historically high raw sugar costs, which were not fully offset by nearly a 20% increase in domestic prices. Contributing to its difficulties, most industrial and some distributor sales are made under fixed price contracts extending more than a year. Imperial also cited high operating costs coupled with losses attributable to its joint ventures.

   The company is a part of LDC's Tropicals segment, which processes and markets refined cane sugar in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) region and has a presence in 16 trading centers.

   In fiscal 2013 LDC's Tropicals segment accounted for 20% of its parent's total revenues. North American markets contributed some 12% of LDC's net revenues for the reporting period.

   To extend its operating capacity and open the door to new product development, Imperial has engaged in a handful of joint ventures with varying results.
  </p>
  <p>
   Imperial Sugar partners with
   <company id="160719">
    PureCircle
   </company>
   via Natural Sweet Ventures to manufacture and sell a reduced-calorie sweetener made from sugar and the stevia plant (a zero-calorie sugar alternative produced by PureCircle). The product is manufactured by Imperial Sugar and marketed and sold by both companies to food and beverage manufacturers in North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company in 2012 sold its 50% interest in Wholesome Sweeteners to an affiliate of private equity Arlon Group. Wholesome Sweeteners, which provides organic cane sugar, agave syrup, honey and other specialty sweeteners to natural-food consumers in the US and Canada, promised sustained growth. Nonetheless, the deal generated a gain of $38 million for Imperial Sugar, supplying a modest salvo to its troubled bottom line.
  </p>
  <p>
   The sale follows Imperial Sugar's decision to sell its stake in its Louisiana Sugar Refining (LSR) venture. The move was spurred by LSR's operating losses, plus need for working capital, resulting in additional funding from the partners, including
   <company id="40079">
    Cargill
   </company>
   and Sugar Growers and Refiners, a cooperative of sugar mills and growers. As part of the transaction, Imperial Sugar contributed its remaining refinery land to LSR, but stood by its obligation to conduct an environmental assessment of the site and remedy any contamination. Imperial Sugar is continuing to package sugar at the facility's small bag packaging operation under a long-term supply agreement for refined bulk sugar from LSR.

  <p>
   In 1843 Samuel May Williams' cane sugar crop and that of his neighbors were ample enough to start a commercial sugar mill. Thus was born the beginnings of a sugar giant. The company incorporated in 1924 as Imperial Sugar with its home base located in Sugar Land, Texas. It remained a Texas operation until the acquisition of Michigan Sugar in 1984 and Colonial Sugar Refinery in Louisiana in 1986. In 1988 Imperial acquired publicly held Holly Sugar, a beet processor in Colorado Springs. With that purchase Imperial doubled in size and began marketing both cane and beet sugar.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions continued in the 1990s, with the purchase of Spreckels Sugar in California and Savannah Foods &amp; Industries in Savannah, Georgia. These purchases again doubled Imperial's size. It had become the largest sugar producer in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, because of falling sugar prices, due in large part to soft-drink manufacturers switching from sugar to high-fructose corn syrup to sweeten its products, Imperial incurred unpayable debt and was forced to declare bankruptcy in 2001. It began selling parts of its businesses to reduce debt. In August 2001 Imperial emerged from bankruptcy.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Imperial sold its
   <company id="121373">
    Michigan Sugar
   </company>
   and Great Lakes Sugar subsidiaries to the Michigan Sugar Beet Growers cooperative; its sugar beet factories in Hereford, Texas, to American Crystal Sugar; and its sugar, spice, and food-specialty unit, Diamond Crystal Brands, to
   <company id="11977">
    Hormel Foods
   </company>
   for an estimated $115 million. That year Imperial also sold off its foodservice business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Imperial discontinued sugar operations at its headquarters in Sugar Land, Texas; however, corporate activities continue there. Operations were shifted to the company's Louisiana and Georgia, plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   Imperial and Michigan Sugar updated a three-year old marketing agreement in 2005, giving Imperial responsibility for invoicing, collections, and other administrative tasks of the Michigan sugar cooperative.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold its Holly Sugar subsidiary to
   <company id="120938">
    Southern Minnesota Bee Sugar Cooperative
   </company>
   for $51 million in 2005; Imperial Sugar retained its rights to the Holly brand, but it divested the Spreckels brand name. The company also sold its former refinery site in Sugar Land, Texas to Cherokee Sugar Land (a joint venture of W.C. Perry Land Development and Cherokee Investments) for $7 million. The deal did not include Imperial Sugar's corporate headquarters building.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a result of the inclusion of sugar in the North American Free Trade Agreement, Imperial and Mexican sugar company, Ingenios Santos, entered into a distributing joint venture (Comercializadora Santos Imperial) 2007, bringing Imperial's products to Mexico and Santos products to the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lackluster performance was further tarnished by the dramatic increase in sales and earnings achieved in 2010, supplemented, in part, by an insurance recovery related to an explosion at its plant in Port Wentworth, Georgia, in 2008. The event, which impacted approximately 60% of the company's refining capacity, drove earnings into the red in 2008 and 2009, on a year-over-year decline in sales of roughly 30% and 10%, respectively. It killed 13 workers, injured more than 40 others, and destroyed the plant's silos and packaging operations, but left refining and warehousing relatively intact. The explosion also spurred an investigation; the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) fined Imperial Sugar $8.7 million for more than 200 violations at the plant. (The fine was the third-largest in OSHA history.)
