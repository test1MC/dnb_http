   Macrocure wants to heal all wounds. The regenerative medicine company develops and commercializes novel cell therapy products used in the treatment of chronic and hard-to-heal wounds. CureXcell, its lead product candidate, is an advanced wound care (AWC) therapy that treat wounds injecting living human white blood cells that have been activated to facilitate the healing process.  CureXcell is currently in two Phase 3, double-blind clinical trials for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers. The product is already approved in Israel for wound care. Private immuno-oncology firm Leap Therapeutics is buying Macrocure.

  <p>
   The company launched an IPO in the summer of 2014 and raised nearly $54 million. It plans to use between $25 million and $35 million of this total for the clinical and regulatory development of CureXcell and between $15 million and $20 million to establish its commercial manufacturing capabilities in the US. It is also using the money to further develop its platform for regenerative medicine products.

  <p>
   The company's growth strategy revolves around achieving regulatory approval for CureXcell and commercializing it initially in the US and Europe. Macrocure is also looking to penetrate international markets with well-developed medical systems, such as Eastern Europe, Latin America, and certain Asian countries.
