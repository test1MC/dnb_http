   For PhotoMedex beauty
   <em>
    is
   </em>
   skin deep. The company manufactures and markets dermatological treatments for skin disorders such as acne, psoriasis, and vitiligo (loss of skin pigmentation). Other products include gels and creams intended to promote skin rejuvenation and hair growth. PhotoMedex also develops lasers and fiber-optic equipment for dermatological and surgical applications. Its FDA-approved XTRAC Excimer laser system is used for the treatment of psoriasis and eczema, and its VTRAC lamp system is sold outside the US to treat the same ailments. Customers in the US and overseas include consumers, dermatologists, cosmetic surgeons, and spas. PhotoMedex plans to sell its operations to Florida-based DS Healthcare.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
        <p>
   PhotoMedex breaks its operations into three categories: consumer (no!no! branded products), physician recurring (XTRAC lasers and NEOVA topical skin care), and professional (VTRAC, Velocity, and other light therapy equipment).
  </p>
        <p>
   PhotoMedex conducts R&amp;D at three facilities; along with developing new products, its R&amp;D activities are focused on expanding uses of the XTRAC system to include the treatment of inflammatory skin disorders; the development of complementary devices to improve XTRAC and other light-based systems' performance; and developing additional surgical products.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   With headquarters in the US, PhotoMedex exports to about 30 countries around the world. Key markets include Japan, the UK, Argentina, and Australia.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company uses a direct sales force along with a global distribution and retail network to spread its products globally. The no!no! branded consumer products are available in about 55 countries.

        <p>
   PhotoMedex saw its revenues increase by nearly 70% in 2012 thanks to an 33% jump in consumer products revenues as a result of a growth in direct-to-consumer revenues due to successful marketing programs, and an increase in retailers and home shopping channels sales thanks to successful marketing programs to the various home shopping channel customers in the UK and the US. It also saw an 48% increase in professional segment revenues.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company saw a huge 300% increase in net income in 2012 as it offset an increase in selling and marketing expenses as the result of a rise in its direct-to-consumer advertising and selling activities, and higher engineering and product development expenses related to pre-merged PhotoMedex products.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company seeks to expand by providing dermatologists, professional aestheticians, and consumers with the equipment and skin care products they need to treat psoriasis, vitiligo, acne, and UV damage, among other skin conditions.
  </p>
        <p>
   Growing its portfolio of offerings, in 2011 PhotoMedex merged with private dermatology firm Radiancy. Radiancy makes home-use and professional dermatology devices for hair removal, skin rejuvenation, and acne treatment under the no!no! and Radiancy brands. PhotoMedex acquired Radiancy in an all-stock transaction. Although the combined operations retained the PhotoMedex name and publicly traded status, former Radiancy shareholders obtained about 75% of the combined company.
  </p>
        <p>
   As a result of its merger with Radiancy, PhotoMedex added a range of home-use devices under the no!no! brand for various indications including hair removal, acne treatment and skin rejuvenation.
  </p>
        <p>
   PhotoMedex is working hard to expand outside the US. Its primary distributor,
   <company id="52374">
    GlobalMed
   </company>
   sells the company's laser- and light-based devices in all PhotoMedex's markets outside the US. The company has even reformulated some of its clinical skincare products, removing certain preservatives to better comply with international regulations.
