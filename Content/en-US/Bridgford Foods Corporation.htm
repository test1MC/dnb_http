   Too many cooks might spoil Bridgford Foods' business. The company manufactures, markets, and distributes a slew of frozen, refrigerated, and snack foods. Its lineup ranges from biscuits and bread dough to deli meats, dry sausage, and beef jerky. (It's one of the nation's largest sellers of jerky and other meat snacks). Bridgford adds to its offerings by buying for resale some snack and refrigerated foods made by other processors. The company sells to food service (restaurants and institutions) and retailers (supermarkets, mass merchandise, and convenience stores) in the US and Canada largely through distributors, brokers, and a direct store delivery network.

   among its largest customers. In fiscal 2013 (ended October) Wal-Mart accounted for 20% of the company sales, while Dollar General represented 10%. The company sells its food products through wholesalers, cooperatives, and distributors. Products made by the company's Frozen Food Products business are generally supplied to food service and retail distributors.

   Bridgford rang up $129 million in sales in fiscal 2013 (ended October), a 1% increase versus the prior year. Net income fell 20% over the same period to $2.9 million. Driving the modest sales gain was a 7% increase at its Frozen Food Products business due to price increases in mid-2013, partially offset by an 8% decline in revenue by its Refrigerated and Snack Food Products unit. The decline in profitability was due to higher expenses and depreciation primarily related to the replacement of delivery fleet vehicles.

  <p>
   Bridgford's focus on convenience foods is unwavering; it has not pursued acquisitions, nor significantly diversified its product portfolio during the last five years. It managed to stay profitable in 2010 despite higher prices for grains, meats, and petroleum, and a slip in year-over-year sales, which remain relatively flat.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has, however, made a strategic shift in operations. The record cost of key commodities and a decision to make a significant adjustment to its provision for taxes drove deepening losses. Price increases and the elimination of under-performing products and operations failed to counter the financial toll. Its hard choices were rewarded in 2009 and, along with lower commodity costs, helped the company rebound and mark its fourth earnings high.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among its choices, Bridgford has increased its push of products made by the company coupled with supplementing its own direct store delivery network and distributor partnerships. In 2010 it inked a deal with Golden Flake Snack Foods (owned by
   <company id="13580">
    Golden Enterprises
   </company>
   ) to sell Bridgford's dry sausage and meat snacks. Bridgford has also continued to tweak its offerings. During the year, it developed a single-serve version of its popular monkey bread, launched a handful of new beef jerky items, and refined its self-stable sandwich and bakery products with an investment in new packaging technology. The company's frozen food business also added several new varieties of bread dough. Such moves enable the company to sell through a greater variety of retail and on-line outlets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bridgford's focus is heavily influenced by the founding Bridgford family. The family owns more than 80% of the company. Moreover, three members are actively involved in its management and serve on the board of directors.

  <p>
   A victim of Depression-era layoffs, Hugh Bridgford used his last $65 paycheck to open a San Diego butcher shop in 1932. He later began providing steaks and prime ribs to local restaurants and hotels. When WWII rationing began, he introduced a line of frozen corned-beef hash and baked beans. In 1944 Bridgford Foods moved to Anaheim, California. Hugh's sons William and Allan joined the company in the 1950s. It went public in 1958.
  </p>
  <p>
   Four years later, a tired company baker froze already-mixed bread dough and the next morning found that it could be thawed and baked successfully. This discovery led Bridgford Foods to become the first company to market frozen, ready-to-bake bread dough. In 1986 the company acquired a bankrupt Dallas bakery and converted it into a frozen-bakery-goods operation. Two years later Bridgford Foods introduced its microwave-ready sandwiches.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992, the year Hugh died, the company expanded its Anaheim facilities. William and Allan each spent time as president before promoting 20-year Bridgford Foods veteran Robert Schulze to the office in 1995. The next year the company completed a new frozen-food plant in North Carolina and modernized the Dallas plant. Bridgford Foods in 1998 began a $1.5 million expansion to its Chicago meat processing plant (it already had been enlarged in 1996), and in 1999 expanded its Dallas sandwich-making operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2000 the company enjoyed record sales of meat-snacks and introduced new products, including lunch packs, sandwiches, and ready-to-bake dinner rolls. Sales increased in 2001, too, and the company grew production lines and added new accounting systems.
