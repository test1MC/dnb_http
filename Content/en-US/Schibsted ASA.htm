   Schibsted traces its roots to Christian M. Schibsted, the son of Danish immigrants, who grew up in an orphanage in Christiania (renamed Oslo in 1924). The orphanage ran a small printing business and published a local newspaper, and it was there that Schibsted learned printing and got a taste for the newspaper business. In 1839 he went to work for Johan J. Krohn, whose printing company published mainly small books. Schibsted took over the business in 1843. Six years later, Schibsted's firm, called Chr. Schibsted Forlag, began printing the satirical magazine
   <i>
    Krydseren
   </i>
   (
   <i>
    The Cruiser
   </i>
   ), which later became the daily newspaper
   <i>
    Aftenbladet.
   </i>
  </p>
  <p>
   Printing
   <i>
    Aftenbladet
   </i>
   became a major source of income for Schibsted, but declining readership led the paper's owners to sell it in 1860. In response, Schibsted launched his own paper, which would become
   <i>
    Aftenposten.
   </i>
   Schibsted died in 1878, and his son Amandus took over the business.
   <i>
    Aftenposten
   </i>
   became the dominant paper in the capital by the turn of the century, and began expanding across Norway. Amandus died in 1913, leaving the business to be run by his wife and, later, his two daughters and their families. Chr. Schibsted Forlag began printing the annual reference book
   <i>
    Hvem, Hva, Hvor
   </i>
   (
   <i>
    Who, What, Where
   </i>
   ) in 1935.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the German occupation of WWII, the company's printing plants were pressed into service to print
   <i>
    Deutsche Zeitung in Norwegen,
   </i>
   an occupation newspaper.
   <i>
    Aftenposten
   </i>
   resumed its business after the war, and by 1960 was again Norway's leading newspaper. In 1966 the company took over publication of
   <i>
    Verdens Gang
   </i>
   (
   <i>
    The Way of the World
   </i>
   ), an independent paper started by wartime resistance veterans in 1945. As part of its deal,
   <i>
    Aftenposten
   </i>
   agreed to let
   <i>
    Verdens Gang
   </i>
   remain politically independent. Tinius Nagell-Erichsen, a Schibsted descendant, took over as business manager of
   <i>
    Verdens Gang,
   </i>
   and in 1970 he became managing director of
   <i>
    Aftenposten.
   </i>
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1970s, the family controlled business was restructured as The Schibsted Group to house its various operations. The holding company again was reorganized into a joint-stock company called Schibsted ASA in 1988, and Nagell-Erichsen was appointed chairman; Kjell Aamot was named CEO. Schibsted applied for a television license in 1991 and helped launch Norway's first national commercial channel, TV 2. The company went public in 1992.
