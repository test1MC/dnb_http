   Griffon operates through the three segments of Home &amp; Building Products (HBP), Telephonics, and Clopay Plastic Products Company (PPC). HBP consists of two companies: Ames and Clopay Building Products (CBP). Ames offers non-powered landscaping products for homeowners and professionals. CBP is a manufacturer of residential, commercial, and industrial garage doors to a network of 2,000 installing dealers and major home center retail chains.
  </p>
  <p>
   Telephonics manufactures high-technology integrated information, communication, and sensor system products for military and commercial markets worldwide. PPC produces and develops embossed, laminated and printed specialty plastic films used in a variety of hygienic, health-care and industrial applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company derives about 55% of its revenues from the HBP segment, out of which Ames and CBP each account for about 25% of the company's total revenue. Telephonics contributed about 21% of the company's revenue as the remainder stems from the Plastics segment.

   <company id="10920">

  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 (September year end), Griffon's net sales decreased by about 3% to almost $2 billion due to lower HBP and Plastics' sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   HBP revenues were 1% lower than the prior year. Ames' revenue decreased 4%, mainly driven by a combination of a warm winter and a cold and wet spring, resulting in reduced tool sales, partially offset by improved sales of North American pots and planters and higher product offerings in Australia. CBP revenue increased by 2% due to improved volume and favorable mix.
  </p>
  <p>
   Plastic revenues decreased by 10%, reflecting lower volume of 4% driven by reduced North America and Europe baby care orders, unfavorable mix of 3%, and a 3% unfavorable foreign currency impact.
  </p>
  <p>
   Griffon's net income declined by 12.5% to $30 million from $32.3 million in 2015, due to lower revenue and higher provision for income taxes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2015 net cash provided by the operating activities increased from $76.1 million in 2015 to $105.9 million in 2016 due to higher deferred income tax, a major decrease in inventories, an increase in accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and income taxes payable.
  </p>

  <p>
   CBP's growth strategy integrates partners, brands, innovative products, and fulfillment services to enhance its industry leadership position. The company is looking to driving shareholder value through investment in organic growth initiatives, complementary acquisitions, and the return of cash through share repurchases and dividends.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 CBP completed a 200,000-sq.-ft. expansion of its manufacturing facility in Troy, Ohio.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Ames introduced the new Telescoping Scratch-Free Snow Brush and scraper, a snow brush featuring a telescoping, elliptical aluminum handle that extends from 36 inches to 52 inches and a 180-degree swivel head.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2016, Ames Australia acquired Australia-based Nylex Plastics, giving it  ownership of the trademark "Nylex" for certain categories of Ames products, primarily in Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Ames acquired Northcote Pottery (a leading brand in the Australian outdoor planter and decor market) for $24 million. The acquisition of Northcote complements Southern Patio, acquired in 2011, and adds to Ames' existing lawn and garden operations in Australia. In 2014 it also bought Cyclone (the Australian Garden and Tools business of
   <company id="10778">
    Illinois Tool Works
   </company>
   ).

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Founded in 1959 as Waldorf Controls, the company changed its name to Instrument Systems that year. Under chairman Edward Garrett, the business acquired 80 companies in the 1960s and 1970s, including
   <company id="109548">
    Telephonics
   </company>
   (1962) and Concord Electronics (1971). In 1983 Harvey Blau assumed management, replacing Garrett, his father-in-law, as CEO. The company bought
   <company id="111376">
    Clopay
   </company>
   for $40 million in 1986.
  </p>
  <p>
   Telephonics expanded Instrument Systems' market focus in the 1990s to include commercial and nondefense governmental clients. The company built its Clopay unit, adding garage door makers Ideal Door (1992) and Atlas Roll-lite (1995). The name Griffon Corporation was adapted in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Telephonics won its largest contract ever -- a $114 million contract to supply British Aerospace (now
   <company id="40681">
    BAE SYSTEMS
   </company>
   ) with communications systems. That year Griffon bought garage-door maker and installer Holmes-Hally Industries ($80 million in annual sales). The next year it picked up Bohme Verpackungsfolien (plastic packaging and specialty films, Germany).
  </p>
  <p>
   Griffon faced restructuring charges and capacity restraints in 1999. To boost profits, it exited the self-storage warehouse-door business and closed or consolidated other operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Griffon bought the search and weather radar products business of
   <company id="10062">
    Honeywell International
   </company>
   for $16 million in 2000. In late 2001 Telephonics Corporation received a $13.5 million contract from the US Air Force to upgrade its Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft with new "friend or foe" identification technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2002 the company, citing unprofitability of the unit, adopted a plan to divest its peripheral operation selling slatted steel coiling doors for commercial users. That year, through its Clopay subsidiary, Griffon acquired majority ownership in Isofilme (plastic hygienic and specialty films, Brazil) and renamed the company Clopay do Brasil. Also that year its Telephonics subsidiary was awarded a $15 million contract from
   <company id="107105">
    Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security
   </company>
   (BDS; formerly Boeing Integrated Defense Systems) for the first production of Telephonics' Communications Open Systems Architecture (COSA) Integrated Radio Management System (IRMS) for use by the
   <company id="150260">
    US Air Force
   </company>
   on its C-17A Globemaster III transport aircraft.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Telephonics was awarded a multi-year contract valued at more than $40 million from Lockheed Martin Systems Integration-Owego to produce cockpit communications management systems for the US Navy's MH-60R and MH-60S helicopters. The next year Telephonics purchased The Systems Engineering Group (SEG), based in Columbia, Maryland, to operate as a subsidiary. SEG provides electronic systems and subsystems analysis, simulation, and support.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2005 Telephonics was awarded a $20 million contract by the US Navy for a digital audio intercommunication system for its P-C3 Orion aircraft.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 its Telephonics subsidiary and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, one of India's leading business houses, formed a joint venture that provides the Indian Ministry of Defence and the Indian Civil sector with radar and surveillance systems, identification devices, and communication systems. In addition it will provide systems for air traffic management services, homeland security, and other emerging surveillance requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
   As its profits fell in 2013, the company is also keeping a close lid on costs. It announced in 2013 it was closing manufacturing facilities in two Pennsylvania locations in order to improve its production efficiencies. Clopay Building Products also in 2013 closed an Auburn, Washington, facility and consolidated it into its Russia, Ohio, location in order to streamline its manufacturing processes.
