   Hoya often finds itself in the public eye. The company makes electro-optical components used in high-tech and medical products. The company's Life Care segment (51% of revenue) sells eyeglass and contact lenses, medical endoscopes (under the Pentax brand), and intraocular lenses. This group also operates the Eyecity chain of contact-lens stores in Japan. The Information Technology segment (49% of sales) makes mask blanks and photomasks for semiconductor devices and LCD panels, optical lenses, and glass memory disks for hard disk drives, as well as photonics (laser equipment and optical glass).

   Following a protracted battle, Hoya bought digital camera manufacturer
   <company id="58418">
    Pentax
   </company>
   in 2007 for $771 million. Although the two companies preserve their brand identities, the deal was intended to quickly improve Hoya's competitive scale against rivals in Japan's increasingly consolidated precision electronics industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hoya subsequently sold Pentax's mobile solutions division to
   <company id="107087">
    Brother Industries
   </company>
   . The division makes portable thermal printers and mobile scanners. Brother gained rights to use the Pentax nameplate for a limited period. However, Hoya's move was countered by an agreement with Pentax to focus on medical equipment and the merger in 2008 to operate as a single business entity. Pentax's R&amp;D strength is applied to endoscope systems that call for new technology, existing product refinements, and future biotechnology and nanotechnology activities.

   In 2008 the Washington-based private equity powerhouse
   <company id="42166">
    Carlyle Group
   </company>
   picked up a 50% stake in the 17-year-old joint venture between Hoya and
   <company id="56878">
    Nippon Sheet Glass
   </company>
   , which makes glass for LCDs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In June 2010 the company sold its magnetic media sputtering operations to
   <company id="12460">
    Western Digital
   </company>
   for about $233 million. The deal includes a multi-year agreement for Western Digital to use glass substrate related to these operations from Hoya.
