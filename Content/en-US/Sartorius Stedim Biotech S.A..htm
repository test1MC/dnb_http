   "Sterile" is the watchword at Sartorius Stedim Biotech (SSB). The company makes and supplies sterilized equipment used in the medical and biopharmaceutical industries for filtration, fluid management, fermentation, purification, and laboratory applications. Products include sterilized, disposable bags, systems that freeze or thaw pharmaceutical components, as well as systems for the sterile transfer of liquids or solids. SSB sells its products to the pharmaceutical, chemical and food and beverage industries, as well as research and educational institutes around the globe. Formerly called Stedim, the firm changed its name in 2007 when it was acquired with German lab equipment maker Sartorius.

  <p>
   Sartorius Stedim had a great fiscal 2015, posting revenue growth of 29% to €884.3 million. The company witnessed growth in all product segments, but particularly in single-use technologies such as filters and bags. It benefited from higher-than-expected growth in the biopharma market, as well as market share gains. Revenue growth was spread across all regions, with the Americas and EMEA particular strong points.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income performance was also strong in fiscal 2015, up 63% to €118.0 million. Growth was attributable to higher revenue, partly offset by higher distribution and sales and marketing costs. Sartorius' cash position also improved, with cash from operations for the year climbing 28% to €142.8 million.

   In mid-2016 the company agreed to buy US centrifuge specialist kSEP Holdings in a transaction valued at some $28 million. kSep's centrifugation systems are used in the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. The company also acquired two smaller companies: BioOutsource, which specializes in contract testing services; and Cellca, which designs production processes.

  <p>
   In 2016, Sartorius Stedim Biotech acquired kSep Holdings, Inc. (kSep), a U.S. centrifuge specialist based in Morrisville, North Carolina, for $28 million. kSep makes single-use cell separation centrifuges, that collect, wash and concentrate cells, reducing both the time and cost of downstream purification.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company acquired Germany-based Cellca GmbH, and Scottish company BioOutsource Ltd. The latter is privately owned and is based in Glasgow, UK, and has been operating in the biotechnology market since 2007. The two acquisitions offer synergy potential for existing product portfolio.
