   When machines talk, CalAmp helps you listen. The former military supplier makes hardware and software to track trucks, planes, and industrial equipment and to keep them communicating. It provides asset tracking devices, mobile telemetry units, fixed and mobile wireless gateways, and wireless router transmission for machine resource management (MRM) and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. CalAmp keeps track of it all through cloud-based telematics and applications offered through as-a-service models. The company's customers are in the energy, government, heavy equipment, transportation, and automotive markets. CalAmp discontinued its satellite business when
   <company id="159685">
    EchoStar
   </company>
   , its only customer, consolidated suppliers.
  </p>

  <p>
   CalAmp's operations have been segmented into Wireless Datacom and Satellite units.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some 86% of CalAmp's 2016 (ended February) revenue came from the Wireless Datacom line with the rest generated by Satellite services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most of the company's manufacturing and assembly is handled by contractors.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Based in Oxnard, California, the company also operates wireless datacom locations in Virginia and Minnesota in the US, and in Quebec, Canada and Auckland, New Zealand.
  </p>
  <p>
   About 83% of sales are to customers in the US with international customers supplying the other 17%.
  </p>

  <p>
   CalAmp offers its wireless datacom through direct and indirect sales force in US and through sales personnel in Latin America, Israel and the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Satellite segment has sold its products primarily to
   <company id="159685">
    EchoStar
   </company>
   , an affiliate of
   <company id="44500">
    DISH Network
   </company>
   , which has accounted for a diminishing portion of revenue. It was 14% in 2016 (ended January), 15% in 2015 and 21% in 2014.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2016 (ended January) CalAmp reported revenue growth of 12% to about $281 million, driven by higher wireless datacom revenues (up 13%) due to increased sales of MRM products into the fleet management and non-vehicle asset tracking markets. The company also had a boost from an order from a heavy equipment manufacturer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income increased 2.6% in 2016 to about $17 million from 2015. Higher sales combined with a tax benefit to produce a profit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash provided by operations strengthened to $47 million in 2016 from $28.6 million in 2015.

  <p>
   CalAmp is not looking back wistfully at its satellite business. With the loss of EchoStar as a customer, CalAmp discontinued that part of its operations in its 2017 fiscal year ended February. It is moving deeper into wireless data communications and expects no negative impact from cutting its Satellite business.
  </p>
  <p>
   A major way CalAmp is expanding its wireless operations is through acquisitions that add technology for MRM and M2M products and services to its lineup.

  <p>
   In 2016 CalAmp spent about $131 million to buy LoJack Corp., a provider of vehicle theft recovery systems and advanced fleet management technologies. The acquisition should accelerate CalAmp's progress into the automotive telematics business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 CalAmp Corp. made a similar acquisition with privately held Crashboxx, an early stage company focused on insurance telematics applications. The price was $1.5 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   CalAmp invested in another telematics startup, SmartDriverClub Ltd., which develops connected car services and applications aimed at consumers and auto dealers in the UK.
