   And a fineblanking company it is. Precision Resource is one of the world's largest precision metal component suppliers using fineblanking technology. Fineblanking is a hybrid metal forming process which combines stamping and cold extrusion technologies. The company has over 100 industry-leading fineblanking presses at its facilities. Precision Resource's secondary processing capabilities include assembly, CNC machining, forming, grinding (double-side, single-side, and fine grinding), heat treating, and lapping. The company's customers include leading automotive, electronics, off-highway equipment, cutlery, hand tools, hardware, lawn and garden, and other equipment makers.

  <p>
   The company produces its fineblanked parts with rolled stock, instead of powder metal components and cast components, giving them increased strength. Precision Resource designs and builds its own fineblanking tooling, which achieve features that cannot be created using the press method. Customers are served by the additional design options and cost savings. It also offers a comprehensive array of finishing capabilities for its components, including plastic over-molding, polishing, deburring, and honing.

   Precision Resource's blueprint for growth involves augmenting its manufacturing capacity and the opening of international facilities. In 2013 it added 30,000 sq. ft. of production space to its Kentucky facility, which specializes in the manufacture of automotive, heavy duty, and off-highway components. In 2011 Precision Resource enhanced its Asia/Pacific presence when it opened its facility in Hangzhou, China.
