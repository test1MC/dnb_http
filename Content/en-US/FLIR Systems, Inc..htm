   FLIR Systems doesn't sweat it when the heat is on. It finds it. Its thermal imaging and obscurant-proof camera systems detect heat and radiation, allowing operators to see objects through fog, darkness, or smoke. Its sensors and imaging products enhance vision for military and commercial applications, such as search and rescue, drug interdiction, border patrol, navigation, environmental monitoring, and explosives threat detection. Industrial customers use FLIR's thermography products, which employ cooled and uncooled infrared technologies to measure temperatures from a distance, for equipment monitoring, process control, product development, and other applications. Almost half of FLIR's sales are generated outside the US.

  <p>
   FLIR Systems organizes its business into six segments: Surveillance, Instruments, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) &amp; Emerging, Maritime, Security, and Detection.
  </p>
  <p>
   Surveillance is the largest segment with 32% of FLIR's operations. The segment makes advanced imaging devices and sensors for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); search and rescue; and other applications. Surveillance products are sold off-the-shelf or customized with additional sensors such as low light cameras or laser illuminators. Products range in price from less than $10,000 for hand-held and weapon-mounted systems to more than $1 million for advanced targeting systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's followed by Instruments, 23%. It makes devices that image, measure, and assess thermal energy, gases, and other environmental elements for industrial, commercial, and scientific applications. Instruments are sold under the FLIR and Extech brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   OEM &amp; Emerging, 15%. Its thermal imaging camera cores and components go into thermal and other types of imaging systems made by third parties. It also makes components for smart phones and other mobile devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Maritime, 13%. It develops and makes electronics and imaging instruments for the recreational and commercial maritime market under the FLIR and Raymarine brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Security segment, 12% is responsible for cameras and video recording systems used in commercial, critical infrastructure, home security, and border surveillance applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Detection, 5%, is the part of FLIR that makes sensors, instruments. and integrated platforms for the detecting, identifying, and suppressing chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives threats.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company, based in Oregon, has manufacturing plants in Canada, Estonia, France, Sweden, and the US that make many of its critical components. (Raymarine products are produced by contract manufacturers.) The US accounts for about half of sales.

   The US government is its largest single customer base, accounting for about a quarter of sales. Federal agencies that use its products include

   , the
   <company id="105717">
    Department of Defense

   , and the
   <company id="119054">
    FBI
   </company>
   . Still, FLIR Systems has a diverse customer base from the private sector, including aerospace and defense contractors, automobile parts manufacturers, heating and air conditioning technicians, building inspectors, research and lab technicians, and manufacturing companies, among others.

  <p>
   Overall sales rose 2.3% to $1.53 billion in 2014, with surveillance and detection the only segments to post lower sales. The decreasing sales in those segments were blamed on continued reductions in spending by US government agencies. Sales in the security segment increased 27%. Profit was up 13% in 2014 to $200.2 million. Higher revenue offset increases in selling, general and administrative expenses, where the company spent more on marketing spending, expenses related to litigation in the course of business, and anticipated costs of a regulatory settlement.

  <p>
   The company has restructured to reduce expenses. It included closing six smaller manufacturing sites in the United States and Europe and a transfer of those operations to larger facilities. The company consolidated optics and laser manufacturing businesses to get benefits from vertical integration. Restructuring costs were costs were expected to be about $45 million.

   FLIR introduced new products aimed at expanding its market among consumers. Its FLIR ONE Thermal Camera for smart phones (both Android and iOS platforms) has enhanced resolution and displays live infrared imagery that allows the user to see from a thermal perspective with a flexible add-on device. The device is uses FLIR's patented MSX technology, providing enhanced thermal images with sharp detail for easy interpretation. Consumers can use the FLIR ONE to detect energy leaks around windows and doors, find a missing pet at night, and monitor suspicious activity in the dark.

  <p>
   While FLIR's acquisition activity was quiet in 2014, the previous year it bought MARSS, a developer of software and sensor control systems for maritime security applications. It was a $3.2 million cash transaction.

  <p>
   Throughout 2009 FLIR made a number of acquisitions including the $20 million purchase of Directed Perception (renamed FLIR Motion Control Systems), a maker of pan-tilt motion control systems for commercial and military applications. The systems are used in security, surveillance, robotic, marine, and instrumentation applications. The company also acquired Colorado-based Salvador Imaging (low-light electron cameras) for around $13 million in cash; it has been renamed FLIR Advanced Imaging Systems. Also in 2009 the company spent $42 million to purchase Pennsylvania-based OmniTech Partners; it boosted the company's portfolio offerings by combining OmniTech's I2 sensors with FLIR's infrared core capabilities for the future development of multi-spectral night vision products.
