   Blessed be the ties that bind a building together. Simpson Strong-Tie (SST) manufactures steel connectors for wood, concrete, and masonry that support buildings. The company's reinforcement products include anchors, angles, bases, caps, connectors, fasteners, and hangers; it also offers prefabricated shearwalls, powder-actuated tools, and adhesives.

    The Home Depot

   is its largest customer. SST is the operating subsidiary of
   <company id="20072">
    Simpson Manufacturing
   </company>
   . It serves customers in the commercial and residential construction, furniture, and do-it-yourself (DIY) markets. The company has manufacturing and warehouse operations in North America, Europe, and the Asia/Pacific region; it markets its products through distributors.

  <p>
   SST's products are marketed in all 50 states of the US and in Europe, Canada, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, and several countries in Central and South America, Africa and the Middle East; it has 22 manufacturing locations throughout the US, Canada, France, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Portugal, China, and the UK.

   stores, which supply to thousands of retail locations nationwide, contractor distributors, home centers, lumber dealers, manufacturers of engineered wood products, and specialized contractors such as roof framers.

  <p>
   Branded products include Strong-Tie (structural connectors), Strong-Wall (prefabricated shearwalls, which are walls composed of braced panels), Quick Drive (auto-feed screw driving systems), and Anchor Systems (anchors and fasteners for concrete and masonry). Additionally, Simpson Strong-Tie is developing construction adhesives that are suitable for commercial and industrial construction (rather than just residential). Given the company's fasteners and connectors are designed to be resistant to seismic, wind, and other forces, SST sponsors seminars to inform architects, engineers, contractors, and building inspectors on the installation of its products, as well as to promote the use of its products.

  <p>
   SST has long-range plans for itself that include strengthening its operations in the US and securing a greater international market share, especially in China and Australia. To reduce its dependence on a dismal and uncertain US housing market, SST has been thinking outside the house by expanding its product lines for non-housing markets that require structural solutions; it is also thinking outside the neighborhood by seeking global opportunities. To that end, SST has 18 manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe, and Asia (especially China). The company's plan is to get manufacturing and warehouse facilities closer in geographic proximity to its customers for faster delivery and service.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company recognizes that different regions have different construction requirements. For example, the majority of construction in Asia/Pacific is not wood-related, so SST markets its Anchor Systems in that region and has subsequently experienced heightened sales. Different regions also experience varied weather patterns -- some plagued by more natural disasters than others -- that drive the use of structural construction products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Led by its strategy is to develop new products, SST also launches 15 to 25 new products each year. For 2015 the company expanded its wood construction product offering with the launch of new joist hangers, post bases and fasteners such as the Strong Drive Timber-Hex HDG screw, Strong Drive XL Large-Head Metal Screw line, and the Deck Drive DCU COMPOSITE Screw.
