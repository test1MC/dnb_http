   Kinetic Concepts, Inc. (KCI) is moving ahead in the medical field by using the power of negative pressure to make a positive difference in wound healing. The company is a specialty medical device maker that develops negative pressure wound therapy systems, which "vacuum" a wound site through a dressing, drawing wound edges together and removing infectious materials. Its main set of products are the V.A.C. line, as well as ABThera and Prevena, which help manage the closure of open abdomen wounds and surgical incisions, respectively. KCI is a subsidiary of

   In 2014, the company revenues increased by 10.3% due to full year results of Systagenix (acquired in the fourth quarter of 2013), and increases from the expansion of products and certain markets outside the US, offset by lower rental revenues in established markets.

  <p>
   As a doctor, James Leininger was disturbed to see patients survive intense physical trauma only to die from complications caused by immobility. In 1975 he and his wife bought a troubled hospital bed maker, renaming it Kinetic Concepts, Inc. (KCI). Leininger bought the rights to the RotoRest, which KCI began renting and selling. The firm's first decade was marked by slow, painful growth; its 1984 introduction of the KinAir bed boosted sales and put the company on firm fiscal ground. KCI went public in 1988.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 KCI sued its biggest rival Hillenbrand (now
   <company id="10731">
    Hill-Rom Holdings
   </company>
   ) for patent infringement on its rotating bed. Two years later Hillenbrand settled with KCI for $84.8 million. In 1995 KCI sued Hillenbrand again, this time filing an antitrust suit for more than $200 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   KCI went on a binge in 1997, buying five medical equipment firms. Among them was Colorado's RIK Medical, which made non-electric beds that could be used in prisons and psychiatric wards. In 1998 KCI was taken private again when two investment concerns, Richard C. Blum &amp; Associates and Fremont Partners, offered it a deal worth about $850 million. Legal woes also surfaced that year when the company was sued over injuries allegedly caused by one of its beds. In 1999 KCI formed Wound Works, a wound management joint venture, with Georgia company Coloplast.
  </p>
  <p>
   KCI was acquired for nearly $5 billion by a group of private equity firms in 2011. The group included
   <company id="40358">
    Apax Partners
   </company>
   and two Canadian pension firms. The deal, which also included another $1.3 billion in assumed debt, made KCI a private entity.
