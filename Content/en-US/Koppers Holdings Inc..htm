        <p>
   The company's revenues grew by 6% in 2012. Carbon Materials &amp; Chemicals segment revenues increased by 6% thanks to higher sales volumes for distillates stemming for increase sales volumes of carbon black feedstock in China and Australia. Railroad &amp; Utility Products segment revenues grew by 6% due to higher sales of value added products to its top  railroad customers. The company also reported higher sales of utility poles in the US (higher sales volume) and Australia (higher sales volume and higher prices). -Financial Analysis
  </p>
        <p>
   Net income increased by 78% in 2012 thanks to higher revenues combined with lower income tax expenses due to lower net tax reserves. Income tax expense was also favorably impacted in 2012 by the recognition of tax benefits for prior years related to foreign tax credits and US manufacturing deductions.
  </p>
        <p>
   With the exception of 2009's recession-driven revenue slump, the company has posted revenue increases between 2008 and 2012.

        <p>
   Its business growth strategy is to selectively acquire complementary businesses and enter into joint ventures and other business combinations that expand existing product lines and the markets where it sells its products.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2013 Koppers and Norfolk Southern agreed to a three-year contract for bonded rail joint assemblies. In addition to bonded rail joint assemblies, Koppers provides various other types of rail joint bar and track component products along with treated railroad crossties and other treated products and services to Norfolk Southern. In 2012 the company extended its sales contracts with CSX Transportation and Union Pacific Railroad for an additional five years to provide treated railroad crossties and other railroad products and services.
  </p>
        <p>
   In a further vertical integration in the utility pole supply chain, in 2012 Koppers agreed to buy the Western Poles business from Ridolfo Forestry Products Pty Limited. The deal provides additional annual pole sales for Koppers of more of than $10 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   Koppers remains active in China, where in 2012 it signed an agreement with Nippon Steel Chemical and Yizhou Group to help construct an integrated coal tar-based carbon products complex in Pizhou City. The complex will consist of three plants, including a distillation plant and two downstream plants producing needle coke and carbon black. Completion of the plants is scheduled for 2014.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2011 Koppers made a strategic move to cease manufacturing operations at its carbon black facility in Kurnell, New South Wales, Australia, while continuing to maintain a presence in that country through its tar distillation facility and its business operations in treated utility poles and related products.

        <p>
   The company participates in a joint venture that has constructed a tar distillation facility, which came online in 2009 in China. Koppers owns 30% of the JV, called Tangshan Koppers Kailuan Carbon Chemical Company, and owns a 60% stake in another tar distillation facility in China, which completed a capacity expansion project in 2008.
  </p>
        <p>
   Koppers grew again in 2010 when it bought a coal tar distillation plant in the Netherlands. The company uses the facility, which also makes carbon pitch and naphthalene, to build on its European business and to aid its export sales. That same year, Koppers acquired the assets of West Virginia-based Portec Rail Products' rail joint business for about $22 million, as well as the Midwestern US refined tar business of Stella Jones Inc, expanding its business in both markets.
