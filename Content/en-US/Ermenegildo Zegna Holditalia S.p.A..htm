   Got a yen for Zegna (rhymes with Kenya)? Hopefully you've got the funds. The Ermenegildo Zegna group makes high-end menswear and sportswear sold at more than 400 locations around the world. Custom suits can sell for a pretty penny, and are popular with the male glitterati. Zegna also makes accessories, such as ties, and produces a line of clothing for Gucci. Founded as a textile mill, the firm produces its own high-quality fabrics and supplies them to top designers and tailors. Zegna has expanded by opening stores worldwide and offering products online. Owned and operated by the founding Zegna family, Ermenegildo Zegna Holditalia is the holding company for all group activities.

  <p>
   Some of today's Zegna employees are the fifth generation to be involved in the company. In 1910, Ermenegildo Zegna (at 20 years old) took charge of his father's Trivero, Italy, textile business. Becoming the second generation interested in fabrics, he started with only three looms. He immediately replaced machinery, aiming to make textiles superior to the top English ones of the time.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the 1960s the company employed 1,400, and an important shift occurred. Ermenegildo passed his business to sons Aldo and Angelo, and they transformed Zegna's high-quality fabrics into ready-to-wear men's tailored clothes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ermenegildo died in 1966. His sons soon added men's accessories and knitwear, and the line was sold across Europe (including Austria, Britain, France, Germany, and Spain) and in Japan and the US. Gruppo Ermenegildo Zegna had formed branches abroad to control international distribution.
  </p>
  <p>
   Zegna apparel entered the Australian market in the early 1970s. Later that decade, Angelo Zegna sent his son Gildo to New York to learn about the US retail market. He worked at Bloomingdale's for one year, later applying his lessons to the family business.
  </p>
  <p>
   The fourth Zegna generation joined in the 1980s. Gildo and his cousin Paolo (Aldo's son) became VPs, Gildo in formalwear and Paolo in textiles. Angelo's daughters Anna and Benedetta also became employees.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1984, there were nearly 30 Zegna shops-in-shops worldwide. The first Zegna boutiques were opened later that decade: Paris was the first store, and Milan the second. Zegna menswear soon entered the Korean market.
  </p>
  <p>
   The first US Zegna boutique opened in 1990 in New York's. Zegna gained an important client in 1992 by manufacturing men's ready-to-wear apparel for Gucci.
  </p>
  <p>
   The late founder's grandchildren continued Zegna's nature preservation commitment. In 1993 they established "Oasi Zegna" -- a 40-square-mile reserve of meadows and forests managed by Laura Zegna. Also that year, sales reached about $285 million, with the US accounting for 20%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company formed Ermenegildo Zegna Singapore in 1994 to manage Singapore's fabric distribution and retail ready-to-wear operations for other parts of Asia, including Hong Kong, India, Macao, and the Philippines. In 1995 sales reached $500 million; by 1996 two more US stores had opened and celebrity clients included NBA players and Spanish royalty. Fashion houses such as Versace and Valentino had become fabric customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   1999 was an eventful year. Zegna acquired Italian textile mill and ready-to-wear (men's and women's) clothing company Agnona. It launched an e-commerce site and opened its first ZegnaSport outlet (Beverly Hills). Sportswear-exclusive stores proved to be successful; three more opened in 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   Exports accounted for 80% of sales by 2000. That year Armani and Zegna formed a 51%-Armani-owned joint venture for Zegna to produce a new Armani line. The company agreed to acquire (in 2001) a majority stake in Italian textile company Master Loom.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company entered into a 50/50 joint venture ("ZeFer") with

   for development of the Zegna brand in the shoe and leather sectors worldwide.
