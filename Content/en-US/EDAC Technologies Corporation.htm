   EDAC reported $87 million in revenue in 2011, which is up nearly 20% from 2010 (itself up more than a third from the prior year). The company saw strong growth across all product lines, including 15% growth in its largest product line (EDAC Aero) as sales to major aircraft engine makers increased.
  </p>
        <p>
   Profit hit nearly $4 million that year, up some 320% from 2010 when net income was at its lowest level since a loss in 2002.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Over the years, EDAC has made a number of acquisitions, allowing it to actively grow its product lines to strengthen its business in the aerospace industry. In mid-2012, it strengthened its core offerings when it obtained EBTEC Corporation, a provider of advanced precision manufacturing and fabrication processes catering to the aerospace, power generation, industrial, semiconductor, and medical sectors. EDAC bought EBTEC for $11 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2010 EDAC acquired New Hampshire-based Accura Technics, a grinding machinery specialist, for $300,000. In 2009 the company purchased the assets of Service Network Incorporated (SNI) for $775,000; SNI manufactures and rebuilds precision grinders. Accura Technics, EBTEC, and SNI give the company new capabilities and technologies that expand its market share in the aerospace industry.
