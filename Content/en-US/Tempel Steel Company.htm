   Tempel Steel Company manufactures magnetic steel laminations (aka electrical steel) used in motors, ballasts, and transformers. The company also produces electrical and cold-rolled motor lamination steel that it sells to manufacturers, subcontractors, and other customers who use it to produce their own laminations. Other product offerings include die casting motor rotors. Tempel Steel also provides services such as die-casting, core welding, and powder coating. The company is owned by the family of the late Tempel Smith Sr., who founded the company in a garage in 1945. In addition to its US operations, Tempel Steel has manufacturing facilities in Canada, China, India, and Mexico.

   Electrical steel is a specialty steel that has magnetic properties. It is made by cold rolling (at temperatures below recrystallization) metal through a pair of rollers. The resulting strips, which are known as laminations, are less than 2 mm thick. These strips are stacked together to form laminated cores, which will concentrate the strength and increase the effectiveness of magnetic fields produced by electric currents.

   Tempel Steel's motor division produces motor, generator, and segmented laminations to the electric generator, hermetic motor, locomotive, and specialty motor industries. The company's transformer division provides such services as applications engineering, metallurgical consulting, and tooling. The steel services division offers cut-to-length sheets and prime slit coils. Tempel Steel's Portage Tool subsidiary provides die engineering and design, design manufacturing, and initial die try out, such as die replacement parts, single-hit blanking dies, and tungsten carbide progressive lamination dies.

   The company's Canadian counterpart, Tempel Burlington, manufactures magnetic products for such applications as ballasts, nickel laminations, and transformers. Tempel de MÃ©xico provides products such as helical wound alternator cores, motor and transformer cores, rotor die casting, and slit coils of electrical steel.

  <p>
   The late Tempel Smith Sr. had an interest in steel lamination, but also in Lipizzan Stallions, which he imported to America in 1958. Known for its classical dressage, the Lipizzaner is one of Europe's oldest breeds of horse, tracing its selective breeding back 400 years. Tempel Farms is the only place in the US that breeds and trains these horses.
