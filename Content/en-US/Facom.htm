   A fact to commit to memory is that Facom, a subsidiary of leading US toolmaker
   <company id="11397">
    Stanley Black &amp; Decker
   </company>
   helps auto mechanics and other industrial grease monkeys get a grip on things. Having shed its baking machinery and steel foundry ventures, Facom (formerly Strafor Facom) has returned to its core product: hand tools (including hammers, pliers, pullers, wrenches, screwdrivers, saws, and ratchets). Facom's products serve the automotive, aerospace, electrical engineering, electronics, industrial fitting, oilfield services, and heavy construction industries. The company's tools are sold in more than 100 countries through a network of around 5,500 distributors.

   The company manufactures and supplies hand tools. It offers storage products, including trolleys, cabinets, benches, and portable storage products; standard tools, such as wrenches, screwdrivers, pliers, and hammers; and tools.

   French holding company

   sold Facom to The Stanley Works for more than $485 million in early 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company restructured after its acquisition by The Stanley Works, and closed several plants and four distribution centers in Europe including the Saint-Eloi site near Nevers, France.

  <p>
   In 1918, at the end of WWI, Louis Mosès opened a small toolmaking workshop in Paris. Mosès called his business Franco-Américaine de Construction d'Outillage Mécanique (which was later shortened to its acronym, Facom) and along with ten employees began designing and making tools for the mechanical and manufacturing industries. During Facom's first year of business the company concentrated on one product -- an adjustable wrench known as Madame 101 and used by the French railway. One of the first of its kind, the wrench was featured in the company's catalog until the 1960s.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1920s Facom broadened its horizons and started making tools for France's automotive industry, including
   <company id="41191">
    Renault
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41827">
    Peugeot
   </company>
   . Facom published its first pamphlet of 60 products in 1924; it later grew into the 600-page Facom Catalog, which featured more than 8,000 items.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1930s provided Facom with a new customer -- the aircraft industry. The company produced tools and equipment for France's new airline,
   <company id="43290">
    Air France
   </company>
   . At the same time, Facom introduced its company logo -- a winged bolt. During the last years of the 1930s, Facom began making kitchen tools and designing products for the high-end tool market.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company benefited from the rebuilding period in Europe following WWII. Though the Facom Catalog was well known in the French tool market, the company began selling its products through distributors rather than relying on direct sales. The company also introduced a new sales concept to its customers -- a lifetime guarantee on its products. Facom continued designing new products in the 1950s, including ratchets, pullers, torques, and automotive items. By the end of the decade, Facom had begun selling its tools across Europe, in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Facom became the European market leader in sales of hand tools in the 1960s. Apart from tools, the company began manufacturing office furniture and baking machinery. The company opened new facilities in Villeneuve-le-Roi (1960s), Ezy-sur-Eure (1967), Nevers (1974), and then moved its head offices to Morangis (1970). Facom began trading stock on the Paris exchange in 1970.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1980s Facom acquired numerous companies at home and abroad, including Bost (pliers), Garnache (screwdrivers), Virax (pipework tools), Dela (measuring tools), Britool (automotive tools), Sykes Pickavant (hand tools and automotive equipment), USAG (hand tools), and Beissbarth (garage equipment). By the end of the decade, the company had become the leading toolmaker in Europe and one of the largest in the world (more than a third of sales came from outside France). In 1989 Facom added Cassina (an Italian furniture manufacturer).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 Facom merged with office furniture maker Financiére Strafor and the new company was named Strafor Facom. Strafor Facom continued its global acquisition strategy, adding operations in Europe and Singapore. In 1998 and 1999 Strafor Facom shed some of its diversified businesses. The firm sold its foundry and baking machinery operations and ended its joint venture with US-based firm
   <company id="40448">
    Steelcase
   </company>
   . In 1999 it bought France's Autodistribution, a specialist in the automotive aftermarket; it also sold most of its furniture-making businesses. That year Strafor Facom was acquired by French holding company Fimalac (led by Marc Ladreit de Lachamière).
  </p>
  <p>
   After the acquisition, the company sold off its extraneous businesses, including ceilings and partitions manufacturer Clestra. In order to reflect its new focus "Strafor" was dropped from the firm's name. By the end of 1999, Facom had acquired France's Fog, Germany's Zippo, and the UK's Tecalemit (all makers of hydraulic ramps for service garages) for a total of about $10.5 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 CEO Alain Gomez resigned and was replaced by Thierry Paternot. In January 2004
   <company id="51801">
    Q.E.P.
   </company>
   acquired Facom's Vitrex subsidiary. Because of competition from producers in low-cost countries such as China and other factors, Facom reported a net loss of more than 329 million euros in 2003.
