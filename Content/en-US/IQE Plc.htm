   IQE puts your epitaxy IQ to the test. The company (formerly International Quantum Epitaxy) makes compound semiconductor wafers for customers whose specialized microchips carry out high-speed functions in communications devices, such as wireless phones and fiber-optic equipment. Compound semiconductors are made from a mix of elements and operate at higher speeds or with less power consumption than silicon-based semiconductors. Wireless accounts for most of IQE sales. Europe has typically comprised only about 10% of total sales, while more than half come from the US, with the rest coming from Asia Pacific. IQE formed in 1999 through the merger of Epitaxial Products International and Quantum Epitaxial Designs.

   About 70% of IQE's revenue comes from its wireless products. Photonics products, which emit or detect light, account for 14% of revenye with infrared products accounting for 8% of revenue with CMOS++ products bringing in 1%. Licensing income supplies 7% of revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   IQE makes its own chips across its products line in factories in the UK, the US, and Asia.
