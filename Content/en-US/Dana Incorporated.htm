   When it comes to building cars, it starts with the parts, and Dana makes the parts that carmakers use to piece together new vehicles. In addition to its core offerings, which include driveline products (axles, driveshafts, transmissions), it provides power technologies (sealing, thermal-management products) and service parts. It makes products for vehicles in the light, medium/heavy (commercial), and off-highway markets. The company's products carry brand names that include Spicer, Victor Reinz, and Long. Dana also supplies companies that make commercial and off-highway vehicles, such as

   .
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Dana manufactures its products in about 100 facilities in 26 countries in North America, Europe, South America, and Asia/Pacific. The company also has engineering centers located throughout the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   North America accounts for 53% of its revenue, while Europe contributes 28%. South America generates around 6%, and the Asia/Pacific region accounts for the remaining amount.

   <company id="10597">

   </company>
   accounted for 20% of Dana's total revenue in 2015, while
   <company id="14354">
    PACCAR
   </company>
   accounted for 8%. Other large customers have included OEMs such

  <p>
   Dana's revenues have gradually dropped the last several years, declining 8% from $6.6 billion in 2014 to $6.1 billion in 2015. The 2015 revenue decline was fueled by a 17% drop in commercial vehicles sales and a 16% decline in off-highway sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The reduction in commercial vehicle sales in 2015 was driven by weaker end-market demand in Brazil where medium/heavy truck production was down 44%. Revenue from its off-highway segment declined due to unfavorable currency effects resulted principally from a weaker euro.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits declined 50% from $319 million to $159 million from 2014 to 2015 mainly due to the impairment of long-lived assets attributable to an exclusive supply relationship with a South American supplier. The company's operating cash flows have also decreased the last two years, dipping by 20% from 2014 to 2015.

  <p>
   Desiring to reduce its dependence on any one geographic market, the company is expanding into growth regions, with a particular emphasis on the Asia/Pacific region, especially India and China. In 2014 it invested roughly $30 million to open its 15th facility in India. The new center supports Dana's Indian operations along with other markets like Europe, Thailand, Australia, Indonesia, and other parts of the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dana also seeks opportunities via acquisitions that have a strategic fit with its existing core businesses. In 2016, the company acquired Magnum Gaskets, a US-based supplier of aftermarket gaskets and sealing products for automotive and commercial-vehicle applications. The deal enhanced Dana's sealing product offerings and complemented its Victor Reinz and Glaser global sealing brands.
