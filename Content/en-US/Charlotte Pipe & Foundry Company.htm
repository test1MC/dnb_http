   "Going down the drain" are words of comfort for Charlotte Pipe. Among the largest makers of drain, waste, and vent (DWV) pipe and fittings in the US, Charlotte Pipe melts scrap metal into pipe via one of the largest fittings molding facilities in the world. The family-owned company's cast-iron and plastic pipes and fittings are used in commercial and residential plumbing, and, under its ChemDrain brand, for chemical waste. The company runs a foundry in the Queen City as well as a division in neighboring Monroe, North Carolina, that produces thermoplastic plumbing pipes and fittings. Satellite extrusion plants operate in Pennsylvania, Florida, Alabama, Texas, and Utah.

  <p>
   Charlotte Pipe has developed a competitive portfolio of products designed to seamlessly work together. A virtual one-stop-shop, it offers a slew of cast iron, PVC (polyvinyl chloride), CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride), ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene), and GlowGuard Gold pipe and fittings suitable for almost any application.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has evolved globally, too. Responding to low-cost producers in China and other countries, it has expanded its manufacturer of plastic PVC pipe, which now accounts for approximately two-thirds of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Charlotte Pipe created Tech Tools, an app for mobile devices that provides simple, on-the-go tools, ncluding an expansion and contraction calculator and a temperature de-rating calculator to account for the effects of expansion and contraction of both PVC and CPVC pipes.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also is diversifying its business by capitalizing on the worldwide mantra to reduce, reuse and recycle. Charlotte Pipe has manufactured its cast iron pipe and fittings from 100% recycled content for decades. It reportedly uses more than 350 million pounds of scrap iron and steel, diverting it from landfills, annually. (Cast iron pipe is, moreover, recognized for its myriad green construction advantages.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has introduced ReUze to capture demand for using non-potable water (in such applications as laundry, toilet, and cooling towers). A less expensive more water-efficient alternative, ReUze pipe is made with a purple CPVC compound -- the universal color code for "do not drink," which is usually painted onto copper pipe that distributes non-potable water inside of buildings. The company has also launched the first PVC pipe made with recycled material. Branded RePVC, its center layer is 100% recycled material; the inner and outer skins of the pipe are made from virgin materials.

  <p>
   In 2012, Charlotte Pipe introduced DWV pipe, which combines ABS and PVC, a market first.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was founded by W. Frank Dowd in 1901 is owned by the Dowd family.
