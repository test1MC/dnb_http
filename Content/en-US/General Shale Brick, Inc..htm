   Wienerberger has boosted General Shale Brick's North American business through past acquisitions, including the addition of Canada's Arriscraft International, which marked the company's entry into Canada. The deal added a strong manufactured stone brand to its lineup.

   General Shale Brick continues to focus on innovation and marketing. It has been playing up the environmentally-friendly appeal of its brick products, which are one of the oldest green-building materials. In 2012 the company launched its new brickweb product, which simplifies the installation of thin brick surfaces for interior projects by using a traditional tile-mountain web-backer for mounting nearly 2 sq. ft. of thin brick at one time. It also rolled out a new mobile app in 2013 that aims to help construction professionals and homeowners in browsing product colors and sizes in brick, thin brick, pavers, and do-it-yourself outdoor living kits.
