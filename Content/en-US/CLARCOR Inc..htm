   CLARCOR cleans up with filters. The company's industrial and environmental filtration unit makes air and antimicrobial filters for commercial, industrial, and residential buildings, along with filters used in industrial processes. Brands include Airguard, Facet, ATI, Transweb, UAS, Keddeg, MKI, TFS,and Purolator. Companies in CLARCOR's engine and mobile filtration business make products under brands such as Baldwin, Hastings Filters, and Clark that filter the air, oil, fuel, coolant, and hydraulic fluids. In 2017, in order to expand its filtration portfolio,
   <company id="11156">
    Parker-Hannifin
   </company>
   acquired CLARCOR for about $4.3 billion.
  </p>

  <p>
   CLARCOR operates in two industry segments: Engine/Mobile Filtration, and Industrial/Environmental Filtration.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Engine/Mobile Filtration segment (about 60% of total revenue) makes and sells filtration products for engines used in stationary power generation and for engines in mobile equipment applications, including trucks, automobiles, buses and locomotives, and marine, construction, industrial, mining and agricultural equipment. The company manufactures and sells both 'First-fit' filtration systems and replacement products such as oil, air, fuel, coolant, transmission and hydraulic filters.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Industrial/Environmental Filtration segment (about 40%) centers around the manufacturing and marketing of filtration products used in industrial and commercial processes, and in buildings and infrastructures of various types. Its liquid process filtration products include specialty industrial process liquid filters; filters for pharmaceutical processes and beverages; and filtration systems and filters for the oil and natural gas industry, sewage treatment and water recycling, and other industrial uses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its air filtration products represent air filters and systems, including advanced medias and treatments and high efficiency first-fit systems used in gas turbine power generation systems, heavy industrial manufacturing processes, thermal power plants, commercial buildings, hospitals, general factories, residential buildings, paint spray booths, medical devices and facilities, motor vehicle systems, aircraft cabins, clean rooms, compressors and compressor stations.

  <p>
   CLARCOR makes and sells its products worldwide, and more than 30% of the company's sales come from outside the US. The company has manufacturing, distribution and service facilities in US, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Malaysia, Netherlands, the UAE, the UK, Japan, and Mexico.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's filtration products are sold through independent distributors and dealers for OEMs, as well as directly to end users.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 10 largest customers of the Engine/Mobile Filtration segment accounted for 35% of 2016 fiscal year (November year end) segment sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 10 largest customers of the Industrial/Environmental Filtration segment accounted for more than 15% of that segment's revenue.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 CLARCOR's revenue declined by 6% ($91 million) due to a number of factors, including the 2015 divestiture of J.L. Clark (the former Packaging Segment) which accounted for $40.9 million; decreased net sales volume (due to lower industrial demand) of $26.3 million in the Industrial/Environmental Filtration segment; and $25.1 from a negative currency exchange rate impact due to the strong dollar.
  </p>
  <p>
   CLARCOR's net income grew by 3.4% to $139.3 million, primarily due to Other, net income of $20.7 million (flat in 2015), which primarily reflected $27.3 million from
   <company id="11003">
    3M
   </company>
   to settle a patent litigation case.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $131.7 million in 2016 to $285.4 million. Some $18.1 million of this increase came from the 3M patent litigation award and the remainder primarily from cost cutting activities, including lowering inventory levels by $36.4 million (resulting in a $58.5 million improvement in cash from operations). The company also reported a $26 million impact from lower cash taxes paid, driven by the timing of tax payments in 2016 and 2015.

   Following the closing of its acquisition by
   <company id="11156">
    Parker Hannifin
   </company>
   in 2017, CLARCOR will be combined with Parker's Filtration Group to form a diverse global filtration business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Restructuring to focus on two core business lines, in 2015 CLARCOR sold its J.L. Clark business (the former Packaging Segment) to
   <company id="43098">
    CC Industries
   </company>

  <p>
   In addition to organic growth, CLARCOR has pursued a strategy of expanding its portfolio through acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   To support its global growth and innovation activities, in 2016 the company acquired certain assets of US-based FibeRio Technology (a technology company focused on the research, development, and commercialization of performance fabric and filtration media) for $11.9 million. That year its CLARCOR Industrial Air division acquired TDC Filter Manufacturing, a top US manufacturer and supplier of pleated filter bags,  dust collection cartridges and gas turbine air filters, for $11 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company acquired
   <company id="58486">
    Stanadyne
   </company>
   's diesel fuel filtration business for $327.7 million and changed its name to CLARCOR Engine Mobile Solutions. That year it also bought Filter Resources, Inc., Filtration, Inc. and Fabrication Specialties, Inc. for $21.9 million.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2013 CLARCOR purchased the air filtration business of
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   's power and water division for $260.3 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 CLARCOR announced plans to invest $40 million for subsidiary Baldwin Filters, Inc. to build a new 400,000 sq. ft. warehouse and distribution center adjacent to Baldwin's manufacturing facility in Kearney, Nebraska.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company acquired Modular Engineering Pty Ltd., an Australian manufacturer of natural gas filtration products as well as a distributor of aftermarket elements. Modular, a longtime supplier to CLARCOR's PECOFacet division, became part of the division. PECOFacet is included in the company's Industrial/Environmental Filtration segment. Modular produces skid-mounted equipment for the natural gas industry in the Asia/Pacific region and expands CLARCOR's presence in that region in both manufacturing and aftermarket sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company purchased one of its suppliers of filtration media, Transweb LLC. New Jersey-based Transweb manufactures and supplies media used in end-market applications, including respirators and HVAC filters.
  </p>
  <p>
   CLARCOR was founded in 1904 and reincorporated in 1969.
