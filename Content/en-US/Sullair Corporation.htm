   Who is the Fresh Prince of Sullair? For this corporation, rotary screw-based air compressors reign supreme. Sullair makes portable and stationary air compressors, vacuum systems, refrigerated and regenerative dryers and filters, and tools -- including rock drills, paving breakers, chipping breakers, and rivet busters. Sullair's compressors and air tools are purchased directly and through distributors by construction, mining, and manufacturing industries worldwide. In addition, Sullair markets remanufactured compressors, parts, and service, as well as training for all of its products. The company is owned by a group of investment firms.

  <p>
   Sullair's factories are located in Australia, China, and the US. It serves customers in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, China, Australia, and the Asia/Pacific.

   Despite the slow economy within the construction and manufacturing sectors, Sullair's international activities have kept their footing. The company has a partnership with industrial rental equipment company, Northbridge Industrial Services. Through Northbridge, a fleet of Sullair's compressors are available for rental and servicing to oil and gas industries and infrastructure projects in Europe and the Middle East.

  <p>
   Sullair also continues to reach into Latin America's largest countries, Argentina and Brazil, by licensing its technology to Sullair/Solairs, an established manufacturer that sells and rents air compressors. Sullair commands a share of the Australian market, too. Sullair Asia operates five offices in China, with additional operations in Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand.

  <p>
   Sullair has been in existence for almost half a century (established in 1965), evolving under the wing of its former parent Hamilton Sundstrand, which acquired the compressor-maker in 1984. Hamilton Sundstrand was acquired by
