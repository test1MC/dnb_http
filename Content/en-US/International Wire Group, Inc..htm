   IWG serves customers in the electrical appliances, power supplies, aircraft, railway and automotive system sectors. The volatile pricing of raw materials, especially copper, is a lingering concern for IWG. The company depends on four leading suppliers for copper, and does not have long-term supply contracts with any of them, creating concern about the reliability of IWG's copper supply chain. Many of the company's customers have their own captive (in-house) wire production facilities, and they could exclusively turn to those facilities, reducing orders to IWG.

   In 2011 the company expanded its operations through the purchase of the machinery and equipment of Ffhoenix Cuivre, LLC in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, expanding the IWG's manufacturing capacity in the US Southwest. In addition, IWG opened a new plant in Dabrowa Gornicza, Poland, allowing the company to better serve a growing customer base in Eastern Europe. Initial investment for these expansions totaled $14.5 million.
