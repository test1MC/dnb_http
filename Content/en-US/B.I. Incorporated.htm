   Thanks to BI, convicts can go home -- as long as they don't go far. BI makes electronic monitoring bracelets and related systems used by corrections agencies to administer home arrest programs.  Its products include monitoring systems (using Global Positioning System (GPS) and radio frequency (RF) technology), and remote alcohol compliance monitoring, in which a client's intoxication level is reported by a breath analyzer to a monitoring computer via phone. BI also operates nonresidential community correctional centers for parolees and offers counseling and reentry programs for adults and juveniles. Founded in 1978, BI is a subsidiary of correctional facilities operator

   BI is fully integrated as a division into GEO's second largest subsidiary, GEO Care, which generates about 20% of revenues. BI's branded products include its ExacuTrack ankle-mounted tracking unit and the HomeGuard RF electronic monitor. Its TAD (continuous alcohol monitoring) device is worn around the ankle and measures ingested alcohol through sensors resting on the offender's skin, while its Sobrietor can transmit the level of alcohol in a client's lungs by transmitting the results via a telephone line.

   The company has also launched TotalAccess, a software product that enables customer access to one system for multiple jobs, such as enrolling or removing clients; viewing and processing violation alerts; viewing, entering and modifying data; and developing and downloading reports. By 2011 TotalAccess was compatible with the
