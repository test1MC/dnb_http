   For Tronox, white equals green. The company's main product, titanium dioxide (TiO

   ), is used to add brightness, whiteness, and opacity to coatings, plastics, paper, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. Its three plants in the US, the Netherlands, and Australia produce more than 465,000 metric tons of TiO

   , Tronox is one of the world's largest integrated producers of titanium ore and TiO
   <sub>

   </sub>
   . It also produces zircon, used in ceramic glazes, and pig iron for steel production. In 2017 Tronox agreed to buy Saudi Arabia-based Tasnee's titanium dioxide business for $1.7 billion.

  <p>
   The company operates three TiO
   <sub>

   facilities (in Hamilton, Mississippi; Botlek, The Netherlands; and Kwinana, Western Australia); two separate mining operations in South Africa, and one in Western Australia.

  <p>
   Tronox has two reportable operating segments: Mineral Sands and Pigment. In 2013 the company derived about 49% of its revenues from the Pigment segment, 46% from Mineral Sands segment, and the remainder from Corporate and Other.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Pigment segment produces and markets TiO
   <sub>
    2
   </sub>
   , which is used in a wide range of products due to its ability to impart whiteness, brightness, and opacity.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Mineral Sands segment includes the exploration, mining, and beneficiation of mineral sands deposits. It includes the  KwaZulu-Natal sands operations in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa; Namakwa Sands in the Western Cape province of South Africa; and the Cooljarloo Sands mine and the Chandala processing plant in Western Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Mineral Sands business has three product streams: titanium feedstock, zircon, and pig iron. Titanium feedstock is used to manufacture TiO
   <sub>
    2
   </sub>
   . Zircon, a hard, glossy mineral, is used for the manufacture of ceramics, refractories, TV screen glass and a range of other industrial and chemical products. Pig iron is used in the steel and metal casting industries to create wrought iron, cast iron and steel. The mineral sands operations have a combined annual production capacity of 753,000 metric tons of titanium feedstock and 265,000 metric tons of zircon. In 2013, the company's total reserves were about 1.14 billion metric tons of ore containing 69 million tons of heavy minerals, including 31 million tons of ilmenite, 5 million tons of combined rutile and leucoxene, and 6 million tons of zircon.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, Tronox's Corporate and other segment consists of its electrolytic manufacturing and marketing operations. Its electrolytic and other chemical products operations are primarily focused on advanced battery materials, specialty boron products and sodium chlorate. Electrolytic manganese dioxide is used in traditional alkaline batteries as well as lithium batteries for hybrid vehicles and mobile computing devices. Tronox sells sodium chloride to the pulp and paper industry for bleaching and boron to semiconductor and pharmaceutical manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tronox's research and development facilities supporting its mineral sands business are located in South Africa, while the majority of scientists supporting its pigment and electrolytic research and development efforts are located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

  <p>
   Although the company uses agents and distributors for some sales in the Asia-Pacific region, direct relationship marketing is the primary technique that it employs for the marketing of titanium feedstocks. It supplies and markets TiO
   <sub>
    2
   </sub>
   under the brand name TRONOX to more than 1,100 customers in 90 countries, including market leaders in each of the key end-use markets for TiO
   <sub>
    2
   </sub>
   .In 2013 Paints and Coatings was the leading market segment, accounting for 77% of the Pigment sales volume; Plastics, 20%; and Paper and Specialty, 3%.

  <p>
   The company's revenues grew by 5% in 2013 due to the impact of acquired businesses and higher volumes, partially offset by lower selling prices and an unfavorable product mix.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pigment sales decreased due to a drop in selling prices and mix resulting from softening market demand, partially offset by higher volume sales in Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mineral Sands revenues increased due to acquired businesses and due to higher sales volumes for zircon and slag fines to external customers, partially offset by lower selling prices for its zircon and titanium feedstock products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Corporate and Other sales remained flat during 2013 as increased sales of electrolytic manganese dioxide were offset by lower sales of other product lines within this business.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2013, 73% of feedstock revenues came from intercompany sales, with the remaining attributable to third-party sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company reported a net loss of $126 million in 2013 (compared to net income of $1,134 million in 2012), due to increased cost of goods sold, and absence of the large gain on bargain purchase (that was present in 2012 associated with a major acquisition), as well as an increase in income tax provision. Cost of goods sold increased due to the impact of the acquired business and higher volumes in both the pigment and mineral sands businesses, partially offset by favorable year-over-year impact of non-cash amortization of inventory step-up and unfavorable ore sales contracts liability, favorable currency translation, and other lower costs.

   Tronox Limited was formed as a holding company for both. The Australian firm then filed to go public in the US in 2012. Not a traditional IPO, the offering did not result in any direct proceeds for Tronox Ltd.
  </p>
  <p>
   After filing for Chapter 11 protection in 2009, Tronox Inc. saw its sales increase the following year as global demand outpaced supply and prices rose. It was also struggling under the burden of a legacy of environmental responsibilities. The restructuring included a stronger balance sheet, an improved capital structure, and a $270 million payment to fund the cleanup of contaminated sites. As part of the cleanup, Tronox agreed to transfer to government agencies and trusts an 88% share of its interest in a lawsuit against former parent Kerr-McGee and that firm's parent company,

   Tronox emerged from bankruptcy in 2011, and acquired the mineral sands unit of Exxaro in 2012. Following to the acquisition 74% of Exxaro Resources Ltd.'s South African mineral sands operations, including its Namakwa and KZN Sands mines, separation and slag furnaces, along with its 50% share of the Tiwest Joint Venture in Western Australia, the existing business of Tronox Incorporated was combined with the mineral sands business under Tronox Limited.
