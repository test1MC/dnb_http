   Samsonite International has built a business on being wheeled around and  tossed about. As the world's #1 travel luggage maker, Samsonite designs, manufactures, and sells luggage, outdoor and casual bags, business and computer bags, and travel accessories such as passport wallets, neck pillows, and luggage tags. Besides its core Samsonite brand, the company makes and markets the entry-level American Tourister brand. It's also extending its reach into casual bags. The luggage maker sells its products through wholesale and retail channels in more than 100 countries. With joint headquarters in the US and Luxembourg, Samsonite began trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in mid-2011.

   Jesse Shwayder founded Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing in Denver in 1910 to make trunks and hand luggage. Samson, denoting strength, was the company's first brand, and ads featured all the Shwayder brothers standing on top of one suitcase. During the Depression the company was renamed Shwayder Brothers; it introduced the first Samsonite-brand suitcase in 1939. After WWII and the Korean War, the company began making luggage with synthetic materials.

   Samsonite (the company's name as of 1965) was bought by Beatrice Foods in 1973. By the early 1980s the company was suffering from foreign competition. LBO firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts bought it in 1986 and spun it off into a new company called E-II. E-II filed for bankruptcy in the early 1990s. Financiers led by Leon Black brought E-II in 1993 under the name Astrum International. Also that year the company bought rival American Tourister. In 1995 Astrum split up and Samsonite emerged a public company.
  </p>

   The company cut costs and introduced new products in 1996, but much of Samsonite's inventory was being sold cheaply in its own stores, annoying retail customers. President and COO Luc Van Nevel became CEO in May 1998. A few months later shareholders sued company directors and Black's Apollo Advisors, claiming they issued misleading statements about the company's success, thereby inflating its stock price. (Samsonite obtained shareholder litigation insurance to cover the costs of the suit which was settled for around $24 million.)
  </p>
  <p>
   By the end of 1999, Apollo and Francois Pinault's investment company, Artemis, had upped their stakes in Samsonite to a combined 60%. In 2001 Samonsite closed its Denver plant, which was its last US manufacturing plant.
  </p>

   Samsonite bought a majority stake in three joint ventures in 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company added a controlling stake in Saxoline, a leading Chilean travel goods distributor, and signed a joint venture agreement with Turkey's Desa to distribute its luggage and travel goods in that country.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2007 Samsonite was taken private by CVC Capital Partners. CVC took on $600 million in Samsonite debt. In 2008 Samsonite saw a sharp fall in international travel and sustained a $1.4 billion net loss before rebounding in 2009. That year CVC injected $155 million in capital into the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2008 Samsonite established a Philippines-based joint venture with Rustan Group's Specialty Investments to distribute and sell travel goods there.

   As the retail industry was feeling the squeeze from the global economic downturn, Samsonite moved to unload its Lambertson Truex brand in 2009.

   The company's US retail subsidiary Samsonite Stores Co. filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009. The Chapter 11 filing was part of the once-struggling company's restructuring, which included closing 68 retail stores in 2009 and 2010 and redirecting efforts to its outlet stores. Samsonite cited the US recession's impact on travel-related products as forcing its retail arm into bankruptcy.
