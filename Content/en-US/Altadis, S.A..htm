   The Pyrenees Mountains may divide France and Spain, but Altadis unites the countries for a smoke. Born of the 1999 merger of Spain's Tabacalera and France's Societe Nationale d'Exploitation Industrielle des Tabacs et Allumettes (Seita), Altadis is one of the world's largest tobacco firms. Altadis brands include Ducados, Fortuna, Gauloises, and Gitanes. Its cigar operation (the top worldwide) produces Antonio y Cléopatra, Farias, Hav-A-Tampa, and Montecristo and controls a quarter of the world's cigar market (mostly from its

  <p>
   When Altadis was born in late 1999, its forebears already had hundreds of years of history under their belts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Spain's
   <l1>
    Tabacalera
   </l1>
   was the world's oldest tobacco company. In 1636 the Castilian parliament in Spain established a tobacco monopoly (managed by lessees) to collect tax revenue. The monopoly controlled the import of tobacco leaf from American colonies and the production and export of tobacco products. In 1887 the Banco de Espana won the monopoly lease and created the Compañía Arrendataria de Tabacos (CAT). The Madrid-based CAT also ran the state stamp-duty monopoly.
  </p>
  <p>
   The CAT created the modern cigar in the early 1900s when it mechanized production and moved the process from workshops to factories. The CAT lost its monopoly license in 1945 under General Francisco Franco's Fascist government. The CAT's management and shareholders quickly regained the license by incorporating as government-controlled Tabacalera.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tabacalera rolled out its Ducados dark tobacco cigarettes in 1963 and its American-style Fortuna cigarettes in 1974. With Spain's entry into the European community, in 1986 the tobacco monopoly began to dissolve; the government kept a majority stake in the company, which began operating as more of a commercial enterprise.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 the company bought hand-rolled cigar makers in Honduras and Nicaragua and paid $275 million for US cigar company Havatampa. In 1998 the firm bought US cigar firm Max Rohr Importer. Spain sold most of its remaining 52% stake in Tabacalera in 1998. That year Tabacalera also announced plans to spin off at least 30% of distribution company Logista.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 1998 Tabacalera formed joint venture Global Tobacco with French tobacco company Seita. The French firm dated back to 1810 when Napoleon Bonaparte reinstated a tobacco monopoly to finance his wars (France's original tobacco monopoly had been established in 1674 under Louis XIV but was broken up by the French Revolution).
  </p>
  <p>
   Napoleon's government-run monopoly controlled tobacco cultivation, production, and distribution. In 1843 the monopoly dubbed its new rolled smoking stick a cigarette. In 1910 the monopoly launched its flagship cigarettes, Gitanes and Gauloises.
  </p>
  <p>
   Service d'Exploitation Industrielle des Tabacs was created in 1926 to manage the tobacco monopoly. In 1935 the company began overseeing the production of matches (allumettes), and its name was changed to Societe Nationale d'Exploitation Industrielle des Tabacs et Allumettes (Seita).
  </p>
  <p>
   In the early 1960s the monopoly was legally separated from the Finance Ministry as its own corporate entity. In the 1970s Seita lost its monopolies on growing and importing tobacco, and it began distributing foreign tobacco companies' products in France. Seita became a corporation in 1980, setting up the end of the French government's control.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought Polish cigarette maker ZPT Random in 1995. Seita was privatized that year, and by 1998 the government owned just 5% of the company. Also in 1998 Seita became the world's top cigar maker when it bought the #1 US cigar maker, Consolidated Cigar Holdings, and it expanded into Finland.
  </p>
  <p>
   In December 1999 Tabacalera merged with Seita to form Altadis. (Its name is a combination of the words "alliance,"
   <i>
    "tabac"
   </i>
   -- which means tobacco in French, and "distribution.") Later that month the new company bought 50% of Corporacion Habanos, a Cuban marketer of cigars.
  </p>
  <p>
   Almost exactly a year later, Altadis began a major restructuring effort to improve efficiency that included the closure of some Spanish factories. In 2002 Altadis bought French stationery company Nordipa SA. Its next purchase came in 2003 with a winning bid for 80% of Regie des Tabacs du Maroc, a government-run cigarette maker in Morocco. The string of purchases continued with the acquisition of
   <company id="53282">
    800-JR Cigar Inc.
   </company>
   in October of 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jean-Dominique Comolli replaced Pablo Isla as chairman in mid-2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   In February 2008 Altadis was purchased by rival Imperial Brands for $18.2 billion. The next month Altadis sold its stake in duty-free shop operator Aldeasa to Autogrill.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dominic Brisby, previously with Imperial Tobacco Poland, replaced Jose Manuel Nunez-Lagos as general director of Altadis in early 2010.
