        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company has operations in 60 countries and plies its wares globally. Europe accounted for 53% of the revenue in 2014.  The company also operates in Americas and Asia/Pacific. Bouncing back from the global recession, which hit the automotive industry particularly hard, Bosch has been expanding in the Asia Pacific region where recession effects were minimal or delayed.

        <p>
   Bosch divides its business into four main categories. The company's Mobility Solutions group is the world's largest independent auto parts supplier. The Industrial Technology segment includes Drive and Control Technology and Packaging Technology, which supply the mechanical engineering, and packaging and process engineering sectors, respectively. Consumer Goods provides Power Tools and Household Appliances and the Energy and Building Technology segment offers HVAC, solar energy, and security systems products and services.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Bosch is represented in about 150 countries.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company's revenues increased by 6% in 2014 due to an increase in Mobility Solutions' sales as the result of a strong demand for modern gasoline direct injection systems, transmission control systems, and continuously variable transmissions. In Europe and China, Bosch's diesel technology business benefited from the ramp-up of new injection systems. Consumer Goods sales increased by 5% due to a growth in sales from the Power Tools division; Energy and Building Technology revenues increased by 2%.
  </p>
        <p>
   Bosch's net income increased by 111% as the result of higher revenues and the positive effects from changes in exchange rates and improved investment results.
  </p>
        <p>
   Operating cash flow decreased by 10% due to an increase in cash used in inventories, receivables, and other assets.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Bosch's strategic focus is on energy efficiency. Drivers include the growing demand for energy, ever tighter climate-protection regulations, and the finite nature of fossil fuels. The company generates 40% of its sales from products that contribute to energy efficiency, environmental protection, and resource conservation. These products account for more than half of the company's current research and development expenditure.
  </p>
        <p>
   To deal with the economic woes of recent years and position itself for growth, Bosch has been investing in Asia. By 2020, the company aims to double its sales in Asia/Pacific and the Americas compared with 2013, to grow faster than the market in Europe, and to increase its annual sales in Africa to 2 billion euros.
  </p>
        <p>
   Streamlining its operations for future growth, Bosch plans to set up a new division in 2016, Bosch Global Service Solutions, to bring together all the internal and external services offered by the company. The division will emerge from the Service Solutions business unit, which is run by Bosch Sicherheitssysteme GmbH.
  </p>
        <p>
   Global expansion is a key aspect of the company's strategy. Bosch is focusing on the growing African market and is continuing to expand its presence on that continent. In 2015 it opened a new sales and service company in Lagos, Nigeria.
  </p>
        <p>
   That year Bosch also laid the foundation stone for its new plant in Russia. In 2014, the company opened a new research and technology center opened in Bangalore (India), its first center for software development and engineering services in North America in Guadalajara (Mexico) and its second automotive technology manufacturing plant in Romania. Bosch is also expanding its presence in Turkey.
  </p>
        <p>
   Bosch applied for some 4,600 patents worldwide in 2014.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Broadening its portfolio, in 2015 in the US, Bosch acquired Climatec, a provider of energy efficiency, building automation, security and life-safety solutions, and Osgood Industries, a filling and packaging machine specialist.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2015 the company acquired ProSyst, which specializes in the development of gateway software and middleware, and planned to merge it with Bosch Software Innovations GmbH, the software and systems unit of Bosch.
  </p>
        <p>
   Strengthening Bosch's consumer goods business, in 2014 the company acquired 50/50 joint ventures BSH Bosch und Siemens Hausgeräte GmbH (for €3 billion) and ZF Lenksysteme GmbH.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company in 2013 acquired software firm Bauer Optimierungstechnik. The company, which is part of Bosch's Energy and Building Solutions group, makes software-based air conditioning and ventilation control systems.

        <p>
   Self-taught electrical engineer Robert Bosch opened a Stuttgart workshop in 1886 and the following year produced the world's first alternator for a stationary engine. In 1897 his company built the first automobile alternator. Later electrical automotive product launches included spark plugs (1902), starters (1912), and regulators (1913). Bosch believed in treating employees well and shortened their workday to eight hours (extraordinary for 1906).
  </p>
        <p>
   US operations begun in 1909 were confiscated during WWI as part of a trade embargo against Germany. Bosch survived the German depression of the 1920s, introduced power tools (1928) and appliances (1933), and bought Blaupunkt (car radios, 1933). Industrial and military demand for the company's products continued from the 1930s until WWII. Bosch died in 1942 and left 90% of his company to charity.
  </p>
        <p>
   Bosch suffered severe damage in WWII, and its US operations were again confiscated. It rebuilt after the war and enjoyed growing demand for its appliances and automotive products as postwar incomes increased worldwide. In 1963 Hans Merkle took the helm. Believing fuel efficiency and pollution control would be important issues in the future, Bosch invested heavily to develop automotive components that would raise gas mileage and lower emissions. The company made the world's first electronic fuel-injection (EFI) system in 1967. Also that year Bosch and Siemens (West Germany) formed Bosch-Siemens Hausgerate to make home appliances.
  </p>
        <p>
   The oil crisis of the 1970s increased awareness of fuel efficiency and benefited sales of EFI systems. Buying a plant in Charleston, South Carolina, Bosch re-entered the US in 1974 to make fuel-injection systems. It introduced the first antilock braking system in 1978.
  </p>
        <p>
   A 1984 strike against Bosch in Germany disrupted automobile production throughout Europe. In the late 1980s the company developed technology for multiplexing (employing one wire to replace many by using semiconductor controllers) in automobiles, established it as an industry standard, and licensed it to chip makers Intel (US), Philips (the Netherlands), and
   <company id="11023">
    Motorola
   </company>
   (US). Throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, Bosch acquired various telecommunications companies.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1993 Bosch's sales dropped for the first time since 1967. In response, the company cut its workforce. In 1996 Bosch bought Emerson's half of joint venture S-B Power Tool Co., which makes Bosch, Dremel, and Skil brand tools. Further consolidating its position as a world leader in braking systems, Bosch also purchased AlliedSignal's struggling light-vehicle braking unit. The company sold its private mobile radio business to Motorola in 1997 and, to speed its business for mobile phones, bought Dancall Telecom (a maker of mobile-phone handsets) from UK-based Amstrad.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1998 the company's Bosch-Siemens Hausgerate joint venture opened a plant in the US and bought Masco's Thermador unit (cooktops, ovens, and ranges). In 1999 Bosch sold its US-based telecom unit to a joint venture of Motorola and Cisco Systems. The next year UK-based General Electric Company (now Marconi) bought the German operations of Bosch's telecom unit.
  </p>
        <p>
   Early in 2000 the company sold its mobile-phone business to Siemens AG. That year the company's joint venture with Siemens bought Rexroth AG (Atecs Mannesmann AG's automation and packaging technology group) for about $9.2 billion. The new division was named Bosch Rexroth AG. In 2001 Bosch bought out Siemens' stake in Bosch Rexroth and consolidated its operations as a wholly owned subsidiary.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2006 Robert Bosch purchased
   <company id="43245">
    Telex Communications
   </company>
   for $420 million. Telex is a provider of audio, wireless, communications, and safety equipment with applications in large public places, including stadiums and airports.
  </p>
        <p>
   Bosch, along with the entire automotive industry, was hard hit in the global economic crisis of 2008 and 2009. Bosch struggled to stay in the public's favor by avoiding cuts in headcount as it worked to shore up net earnings, which waned more than 85% in 2008 from 2007 and plunged to a loss of €1,214 ($1.6 billion) in 2009. In response, Bosch shed weaker units. North American sales, which declined more than 10% in 2009 from 2008, were partially offset by Bosch's hammering out a sale with
   <company id="109756">
    Akebono Brake Industry
   </company>
   . The Japanese manufacturer of brakes bought Bosch's North American foundation brake production. (Bosch's significant stake in Akebono gave the German auto parts maker a solid position.) The transaction included Bosch assets to manufacture corner modules, drum brakes, disc brakes, and related parts at plants in Michigan, Tennessee, and South Carolina.
  </p>
        <p>
   In late 2008, Bosch sold its "car infotainment" business, branded Blaupunkt to Aurelius, a German investment group. The deal comprised the trade name and portfolio of car radio, hi-fi component, and advanced navigation devices. Also that same year, it bought a majority stake in ersol Solar Energy (renamed
   <company id="145360">
    Bosch Solar Energy
   </company>
   in 2009), a German manufacturer of wafer-based mono- and polycrystalline silicon solar cells and thin-film solar modules used to generate electricity from sunlight.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 the Bosch Automotive Aftermarket division spent about $120 million euros in a spark plug and brake pad manufacturing facility in Nanjing, China. The facility, which represents Bosch's largest investment anywhere, houses testing and R&amp;D operations. The move put Bosch in the center of fast growing Asia and positioned it close to many of its automotive OEM customers.
