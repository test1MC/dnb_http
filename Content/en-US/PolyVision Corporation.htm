   No presentation is complete without visual displays, so PolyVision wants all eyes on its boards. The company's ceramic steel brands include its e3 series of chalkboards and whiteboards, sold primarily to primary and secondary education markets, and its a3 wall panel series, which are custom designed panels used in public space infrastructure projects. A leading supplier of ceramic steel surfaces to educational institutions as well as architectural panels for commercial applications, PolyVision's white boards are scratchproof, fireproof, weatherproof, and produce no chalk dust. Founded in 1954, the company is owned by office furniture maker
   <company id="40448">
    Steelcase
   </company>
   and operates worldwide.

   PolyVision falls into Steelcase's "Other" business category and is a sister company to

    IDEO
   </company>
   and the Coalesse Group in that segment. In 2013 Steelcase integrated PolyVision's global technology business into its Steelcase Education Solutions group.

        <p>
   While parent Steelcase doesn't break out sales for its PolyVision brand, it reported that PolyVision drove the segment's $267.6 million in sales in fiscal 2014 (ended February).

        <p>
   The summertime is PolyVision's peak sales period, as schools will often conduct renovations while students are on vacation. In late 2011 PolyVision expanded its reach into the Middle East markets by introducing its interactive whiteboard, which has no visible speakers and amplifiers.
