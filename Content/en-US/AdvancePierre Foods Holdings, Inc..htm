   AdvancePierre Foods takes the prep out of preparing a meal. The company is a top US supplier of packaged sandwiches, fully-cooked chicken and beef items, veggie patties, breaded meats, and bakery products. It caters to several sectors, such as schools, vending, wholesale clubs, and grocery and convenience stores. As part of its business, it operates meat processing plants, sandwich assembly facilities, and bakeries across five mostly Midwestern states. AdvancePierre Foods was formed by the merger of Pierre Foods, Advance Food Company, and Advance Brands. The company is owned by

   along with shareholders and managers of its predecessor companies.

  <p>
   From its base in Cincinnati, AdvancePierre Foods operates nearly a dozen facilities nationwide. The company runs plants in Oklahoma, Ohio, and Iowa to process meats, and manages sandwich assembly facilities in the Carolinas and Ohio. AdvancePierre prepares its own baked goods, as well, from bakeries in North Carolina and Oklahoma.

  <p>
   AdvancePierre Foods operates four divisions: convenience and vending; foodservice; retail; and schools. All are based in Edmond, Oklahoma, with the exception of the convenience and vending division, which is located in Cincinnati. Indeed, the company's 220,000-sq.-ft. manufacturing plant located north of the Tri-County Mall (in Springdale, Ohio) can produce 600,000-plus pounds of beef, pork, and chicken products each day.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company produces some 2 million sandwiches a day and has nearly 2,000 employees engaged in sandwich making. APF's sandwich products span branded and private-label offerings in the retail and convenience spaces and include a number of healthy breakfast and lunch options for the company's school channel customers.

   AdvancePierre gets its food items in the hands of consumers through several channels. It sells its products through schools, vending operators, convenience stores, foodservice providers, military commissaries and other outlets, retailers, and club stores. Its retail brands, which sell under the names Fast Fixin' and Fast Classics, are sold through the likes of

  <p>
   The business has grown through organic growth, acquisitions, and partnerships.
  </p>
  <p>
   To offer more elbow room, AdvancePierre in 2014 relocated its headquarters office, including more than 100 of its executives and staff, to a new 25,000-sq.-ft. office at the Landings of Blue Ash II on Carver Road in Blue Ash, Ohio. APF also expanded its sandwich production by 25% in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it completed nearly 230 new projects and 171 new stock keeping units (SKUs) in 2014. In 2013 it expanded its BIG AZ brand sandwich line with the launch of the BaconAddict Cheeseburger.

  <p>
   Acquisitions are key to AdvancePierre's growth strategy. In 2015, the company bought Illinois-based Landshire Inc.'s manufacturing operations, including the Caseyville facility. Landshire makes more than 80 different prepared food products, including various sandwiches.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it also agreed to acquire Better Bakery, LLC, a Valencia, California-based manufacturer of premium stuffed sandwiches.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Since the 2010 merger of Pierre Foods, Advance Food Company, and Advance Brands to form AdvancePierre Foods (APF), revenues have increased from $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company purchased Maine-based Barber Foods, which processes and packages chicken nuggets, stuffed chicken entrees, and other value-added chicken products. As part of the deal, Barber continues to process and market poultry from its factory in Maine under its namesake brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 it introduced its Fast Fixin' Sandwich Bar program, which allows convenience stores to offer fresh, customizable sandwiches in a self-serve format. Also in 2012, APF partnered with
   <company id="123091">
    Johnsonville Sausage
   </company>
   to deliver the sausage company's products via its distribution network to food service customers nationwide.
