   Mark my words, Matrix Marking specializes in electronic systems designed for tagging and tracking surgical equipment and other small components. The company offers a number of techniques which are offered to hospitals to mark their surgical instruments. The company's Identimark reader uses a camera to identify a pattern of small dots that has been imprinted onto a metal surface using a method called dot-peening. The code can contain such information as the name of the hospital where an instrument was originally used or what procedure the instrument was last used to perform. Matrix Marking's system is also used in the automotive and aerospace industries to label components using a durable marking method.
