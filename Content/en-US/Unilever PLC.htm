  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates in four segments: Personal Care (36% of Unilever's 2014 revenues); Foods, 27%; Refreshment, 19%; and Home Care, 18%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Unilever's products are generally sold through its own sales force as well as through independent brokers, agents and distributors to chain, wholesale, co-operative and independent grocery accounts, food service distributors and institutions. Products are physically distributed through a network of distribution centers, satellite warehouses, company-operated and public storage facilities, depots and other facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   E-commerce,is an increasingly significant distribution channel. In the retail market e-commerce sales account for 1.2% of total sales, and it is expected to double to 2.4% by 2020 due to growth in emerging markets where mobile phones one of the most effective ways of delivering advertising to individuals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Global digital advertising is estimated at $137.5 billion, or about 25% of Unilever's total advertising spend.

  <p>
   In 2014, the company's revenues decreased by 14% due the following factors:
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from personal care dropped as the result of lower volume growth driven by a slowdown in global markets and strong competition;
  </p>
  <p>
   Food sales declined due to exchange rate movements and business disposals (including the Ragu and Bertolli pasta sauces business), while savory and dressings both grew (but spreads declined due to lower consumer demand for margarine in Europe and North America);
  </p>
  <p>
   Refreshment revenues dropped due to exchange rate movements and business disposals (primarily SlimŸFast), offset by acquisitions (Talenti Gelato &amp; Sorbetto);
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from Home Care showed strong growth, supported by the impact of the Qinyuan acquisition, partially offset by exchange rate movements.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unilever's net income declined by 5.7% in 2014 due to lower revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 cash from operating activities increased by 12% due to the net inflow of acquisitions and disposals.

  <p>
   Unilever aims to double its business with innovative brands backed by marketing and a best-in-class supply chain. The strategic choices across four categories (personal care, home care, foods, refreshment, emerging markets) focus on growing brands in emerging markets which retain good long-term growth prospects.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unilever points to several countries for steady growth. These include Africa, the Americas (including Brazil and Mexico), China, Europe, India, and Russia. China, Russia, and Brazil are three of the company's biggest hair care markets in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Unilever launched a crowdsourcing initiative to drive sustainable growth by serving as a hub to centrally organize all crowdsourcing briefs.

  <p>
   In 2016 Unilever acquired plant-based household products maker Seventh Generation for $700 million. The acquisition brings to Unilever's Home Care business a well-established line of eco-friendly detergents and household cleaners.
