   This Trane runs hot and cold. The subsidiary of
   <company id="10785">
    Ingersoll-Rand
   </company>
   supplies heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems to both the residential and commercial markets around the world. Trane specializes in designing massive commercial systems that heat and cool big buildings such as Beijing's World Trade Center and Toronto's Skydome. Its residential products are sold under the Trane and American Standard brands. Other products include chillers, air handlers and terminal devices, and thermostats. Trane also makes energy-efficient systems and filtered air systems that remove allergens and dust. The company sells its products through sales offices and dealers around the world.

        <p>
   New Jersey-based Trane does business through 400 locations in more than 100 countries. It has around 30 manufacturing plants in places such as the US, Brazil, China, Egypt, Europe, Mexico, and Asia.

   While Ingersoll Rand (IR) doesn't break out Trane's financial results, Climate Solutions (to which Trane belongs) is the company's largest business segment, accounting for $7.4 billion of IR's $14 billion in sales in 2012.

        <p>
   The combination of Ingersoll Rand and Trane created a giant in the climate control industry, with Trane products adding to Ingersoll-Rand's existing brands that include Thermo-King. In light of the economic downturn, which led to lower residential and commercial construction, Ingersoll Rand restructured its manufacturing operations in order to cut costs. As a result, hundreds of jobs were cut at Trane plants.
  </p>
        <p>
   Shortly before it was acquired by Ingersoll Rand, Trane disposed of its vehicle braking and plumbing operations to concentrate on its air conditioning and heating and ventilation business.
  </p>
        <p>
   Moving forward, Trane is focused on producing energy-efficient, technically savvy products. For example, the company teamed with fellow Ingersoll Rand company,
   <company id="129289">
    Schlage
   </company>
   , to offer Trane ComfortLink II Thermostat, which allows home owners to control  their thermostats remotely with a mobile device or computer. Trane also is growing to meet an increase in demand for high performance buildings -- energy-efficient commercial buildings that utilize technology to reduce energy consumption and costs.

        <p>
   In 1881 American Radiator began making steam and water-heating equipment in Buffalo, New York. J. P. Morgan acquired the company, along with almost every other US heating-equipment firm, and consolidated them as American Radiator in 1899. That year Ahrens &amp; Ott joined with Standard Manufacturing to create Standard Sanitary, which produced enameled cast-iron plumbing fixtures.
  </p>
        <p>
   Both American Radiator and Standard Sanitary grew through acquisitions early in the 20th century. In 1929 the companies merged to form American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary, expanding operations across the Americas and into Europe. By the 1960s the company was the world's #1 manufacturer of plumbing fixtures.
  </p>
        <p>
   The firm became American Standard in 1967 and began diversifying through acquisitions. In 1968 it bought Westinghouse Air Brake (WABCO), which made railway brakes and, later, automotive products. (WABCO traces its history to Union Switch and Signal, founded in 1882.) During the 1970s and 1980s, the firm consolidated operations and sold numerous businesses. It bought Trane (air conditioners) in 1984.
  </p>
        <p>
   American Standard fought off a hostile takeover by Black &amp; Decker (now part of
   <company id="11397">
    Stanley Black &amp; Decker
   </company>
   ) in 1988 and then agreed to be purchased by ASI Holding (formed by LBO firm
   <company id="99303">
    Kelso &amp; Company
   </company>
   ) and taken private. The transaction left the firm deeply in debt. To raise cash, it sold its Manhattan headquarters, its railway signal business, its Steelcraft division, and its pneumatic-controls business in 1988.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company suffered throughout the 1990s from slow sales growth and poor earnings, prompting the company to streamline operations, shake up management in several areas, and institute a just-in-time manufacturing system to help pare inventory. American Standard sold its railway brake operations in 1990 and its Tyler Refrigeration unit in 1991, losing $22 million in the deal. In 1994 the company acquired 70% of Deutsche Perrot-Bremsen's automotive brake business in a joint venture. American Standard went public again in 1995 and bought the 67% of Etablissements Porcher Paris (bathroom fixtures) that it did not already own. Late in 1996 American Standard fought off a takeover bid by
   <company id="11516">
    Tyco
   </company>
   . The next year Horst Hinrichs (SVP at WABCO) was appointed vice chairman of the corporation to provide management succession.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1999 the company bought the bathroom-fixtures business of Blue Circle (UK) for $417 million to boost its sales in Europe. American Standard also hired AlliedSignal's president, Frederic Poses, to replace Emanuel Kampouris as chairman and CEO and began seeking a buyer for its medical diagnostics operations that year. (The company's medical systems group, which began operating in 1989, made low-cost analyzers and diagnostic supplies for use in doctors' offices.) American Standard sold its medical unit in 2000. Later that year the company sold its Calorex water heater business.
  </p>
        <p>
   A sputtering economy adversely affected 2001 sales, especially for braking systems. Poses dealt with the company's heavy debt and sluggish profit margins by improving employee performance and cutting jobs. To reduce costs, American Standard laid off about 8% of its workforce in 2001. Also that year the company's air-conditioning subsidiary,
   <company id="112494">
    Trane
   </company>
   , announced plans for a global alliance with a Japanese air-conditioning manufacturer,
   <company id="106212">
    Daikin
   </company>
   , to cross-market and sell each other's products beginning in 2002.
  </p>
        <p>
   In early 2003 American Standard acquired Spain's second-largest manufacturer of porcelain sanitary-ware,
   <company id="99532">
    COEMAC
   </company>
   's Sangra business, to strengthen its position in Europe.
  </p>
        <p>
   American Standard divested its vehicle components and plumbing businesses to concentrate on its HVAC operations in 2007. It renamed itself Trane, after that division. Trane was acquired by Ingersoll-Rand in 2008 for some $10 billion.
