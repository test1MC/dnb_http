   Bourns' identity is firmly rooted in electronic components. It provides power circuit protection devices, sensors, resistors, switches, encoders, panel controls, dials, potentiometers, and chip resistor arrays. The family owned company offers automotive technologies to enhance its sensors, component miniaturization (microelectronic modules), and reference designs (product design kits). The company serves the audio, automotive, computer, consumer, industrial, medical, instrumentation, and telecommunications markets.

   In 2012, the company expanded its automotive production facility in Chihuahua, Mexico, strengthening its leadership role in sensor manufacturing.

   Bourns' products are so popular and widely used that the company has uncovered counterfeit parts in some markets. Counterfeit copies of the company's TISP thyristor surge protection devices have turned up in China, and Bourns trimming potentiometers have also been faked and sold as the genuine article. The company warns potential customers to buy directly from Bourns or authorized distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bourns has expanded into new markets through the acquisition of companies and technologies, making 10 in the last dozen years.

   Bourns in 2014 acquired Komatsulite Manufacturing, a maker of safety devices for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries and based in Osaka, Japan. Komatsulite operates manufacturing facilities in Japan and China and generates more than $100 million in annual revenue. Bourns' previous acquisition was in 2012 when it acquired Stockholm-based Jensen Devices, a designer and manufacturer of gas discharge tubes used in automotive (for headlights), industrial, and telecom sectors.
