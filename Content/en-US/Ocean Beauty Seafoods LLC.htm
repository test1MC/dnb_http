   Prefer your piscatory purchase to be fresh, frozen, or canned? Ocean Beauty Seafoods has it covered. Doing no fishing of its own, the company buys seafood from commercial fishermen and then processes, sells, and distributes its seafood products in Alaska and across the continental US. Founded in 1910, the company also exports seafood to Mexico, Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Ocean Beauty's specialty products include smoked salmon, smoked salmon spreads, pickled and marinated herring, shrimp cocktail, caviar, and lobster pâté. Nonprofit Bristol Bay Economic Development Corporation owns 50% of Ocean Beauty; individual investors own the rest.
