  <p>
   RBC operates through four reportable business segments: Plain Bearings, Engineered Products, Roller Bearings, and Ball Bearings. Plain Bearings represents 45% of total revenue and is used in aircraft controls, helicopter rotors, or in heavy mining, and construction equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Engineered Products consists of highly engineered hydraulics, fasteners, collets, and precision components used in aerospace, marine, and industrial applications. Roller Bearings are anti-friction bearings that use rollers in place of balls. The company manufactures four basic types of roller bearings: heavy duty needle roller bearings with inner rings, tapered roller bearings, track rollers, and aircraft roller bearings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ball Bearings makes four basic types of ball bearings: high precision aerospace, airframe control, thin section, and commercial ball bearings, which are used in high-speed rotational applications.

  <p>
   The company operates about 30 facilities in the US and has international operations in Canada, Switzerland, Mexico, and Poland. RBC's warehouses reside in the Midwest, Southwest, and on the East and West coasts of the US as well as in France and Switzerland. The US is its largest market, accounting for more than 85% of total sales.

  <p>
   The company sells its products through a direct sales force located in North America, Europe, Asia, and Latin America. It also utilizes marketing managers, product managers, customer service representatives, product application engineers, and a global network of industrial and aerospace distributors. The aerospace and defense markets account for more than 65% of total sales. Sales to its top 10 customers generate 33% of total sales.

  <p>
   RBC has experienced unprecedented growth over the last few years. Its revenues climbed 34% $445 million in 2015 to $597 million in 2016. Profits also jumped 10% from $58 million in 2015 to $64 million in 2016. Both these totals represented historic milestones for the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2016 was driven by an explosive 439% surge in sales from Engineered Products largely due to additional revenue from its Sargent acquisition. Through the purchase, RBC enjoyed impressive growth within the aerospace and industrial markets. Related to these factors, sales from the US sales also climbed by 29% in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   From 2015 to 2016, the company's cash flow spiked from $72 million to $84 million mainly due to favorable changes in inventory.

  <p>
   RBC has managed to increase its sales to the aftermarket. Bearings, which are indispensable for a machine's operating efficiency, periodically wear out, which creates a second stream of replacement parts sales. During 2016 aftermarket sales of replacement parts for installed equipment accounted for nearly 45% of RBC's revenues. Aerospace and defense customers also promise a particularly reliable opportunity for replacement business.

  <p>
   The company makes acquisitions in order to further develop its offerings, end-markets, and geographic footprint. In early 2016, the company acquired Arizona-based Sargent, an expert in precision-engineered products, services, and repairs for aircraft airframes and engines, rotorcraft, submarines, and land vehicles, for $500 million in cash. The deal enhanced RBC's product portfolio and engineering technologies and added exponentially to its Plain Bearings and Engineering Products segments.

  <p>
   RBC Bearings is an amalgamation of companies, merged and acquired. The company got its start in 1919 making ball bearings; by the 1940s it became the sole supplier for landing gear bearings on military aircraft made by

   . In 2005 the company jetted onto the public investor market.
