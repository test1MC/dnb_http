   DexCom wants to bring dexterity and communication to diabetes patients. The company develops and manufactures a glucose monitoring system called G4 PLATINUM that measures and wirelessly transmits blood sugar levels from a sensor on the patient to the company's receiver. Real-time data is processed and displayed so patients can assess blood glucose trends. Patients are also alerted when levels are too high or too low. The company's other product, GlucoClear, is used in hospitals to monitor blood glucose levels in critical care patients. DexCom's products are marketed to physicians, endocrinologists, and diabetes educators in the US and select international markets.

  <p>
   The majority of DexCom's sales come from its G4 PLATINUM glucose monitoring system, which it makes in-house with parts from third-party suppliers. The monitor is a next-generation version of its earlier SEVEN PLUS product. G4 is the only sensor approved for seven days of wear (as opposed to the standard three to five days). It is also designed to alert patients of both hyper- and hypoglycemia with a fixed alarm and show patients glucose trends over a three hour period. DexCom's products are designed to complement, but not replace, standard home glucose monitoring devices. The short-term systems need replacement sensors and have to be recalibrated with a home device every seven days.

   DexCom has reported steadily increasing revenue in the past few years. In 2013 it rose 60%, to $160 million from $60 million, as sales rose after the launch of its latest system, G4 PLATINUM. Though net losses continue to dog the company, the numbers are going in the right direction. In 2013 it reported a 47% improvement as net loss rose from $59 million to $30 million on the strength of rising revenue. The improved net loss lead to improved cash flow as it went from cash used in operations of $33 million to cash from operations of $2.4 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   As of the end of 2013, the company had a total accumulated deficit of $475.4 million.
