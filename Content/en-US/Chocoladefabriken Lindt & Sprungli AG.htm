   There are Swiss companies that make fine Swiss watches and there are Swiss companies that make fine Swiss knives; Chocoladefabriken Lindt &amp; Sprüngli (Lindt), however, makes fine Swiss
   <em>
    chocolates
   </em>
   . The company sells its premium smooth chocolates worldwide through its own Lindt stores, independent distributors, and online. Lindt's brand names include Caffarel, Lindor, and Lindt. Its products range from boxed assortments to bars, individually wrapped pieces, and, of course, chocolate Easter bunnies -- including the company's perennially popular Gold Bunnies. Its US subsidiary,
   <company id="130118">
    Ghirardelli
   </company>
   , is a leading chocolatier in the US. Switzerland's oldest chocolate company, Lindt chocolates are sold in over 100 countries.

        <p>
   Lindt's primary market is Europe, which accounts for about two-thirds of its total sales. Chocolate consumption is on the rise in Germany, the company's largest market there (17% of sales), followed by Switzerland (13%). North America accounts for 28% of Lindt's business, with other countries, including Australia and South Africa, making up the rest.

   Chocoladefabriken Lindt &amp; Sprüngli (Lindt) has eight production plants -- six in Europe and two in the US -- and 18 subsidiaries, including San Francisco-based
   <company id="130118">
    Ghirardelli Chocolate Co
   </company>
   . (acquired in 1998), Lindt &amp; Sprüngli (USA), and Lindt &amp; Sprüngli (Canada) in North America. The Swiss firm is expanding its retail business, which operates Lindt Boutiques, and chocolate shops and cafes in major cities around the world. Its duty free/travel retail business has outposts at airports.

        <p>
   The Swiss chocolate maker has agreed to acquire Kansas City-based
   <company id="55383">
    Russell Stover Candies
   </company>
   . The purchase will make Lindt the third-largest chocolate manufacturer in North America. Russell Stover, the largest maker of boxed chocolates in the US, makes and sells the Whitman Sampler and Russell Stover brands of chocolates and candies. Russell Stover operates four chocolate factories in the US. Lindt is financing the purchase through cash and debt. The purchase price was not disclosed.

        <p>
   Like all premium confectioners, Lindt is exquisitely sensitive to the weather (too hot and sales fall), trends in tourism (duty-free sales suffer if travel is down), cocoa bean prices, and consumers' over-all willingness to indulge themselves. After a rough patch during the global economic downturn, Lindt's sales and profits are on the rise. In 2011 sales increased by about 1%, after posting a double-digit sales increase in the previous annual comparison. Profits rose as well. Lindt faced several challenges in 2011, including the debt crisis and high unemployment in the euro zone. As a result, Lindt's retail customers (including supermarkets, department stores, and mass merchants) were reluctant to place big orders, which put a lid on sales. Indeed, the US -- Lindt's biggest and most important single market -- was the only one in which economic conditions, including employment, improved, albeit slightly. Indeed, sales in North America increased by 8.5% to more than $775 million in 2011 vs. $714 million the previous year.

   In 2011 the company adopted a new group management structure, replacing the CEO with a group of four individuals. The new "Extended Management Group" is intended to pave the way for continued global expansion and sales and profit growth. Historically the company has grown, in part, because of acquisitions such as Italy's Caffarel and the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company in the US, but also because it continues to develop new products, such as chili-pepper flavored chocolate bars and an Excellence brand dark chocolate flavored with Fleur de Sel (
   <em>
    i.e.
   </em>
   , salt). Products with higher percentages of cocoa butter, such as its Création 70%, also help the company's bottom line. Its growing popularity in North America, which accounted for 28% of sales in 2011 (up from just 4% in 1992), has also fueled growth. To serve North America's growing demand for premium chocolate and get closer to the US market, Lindt has invested heavily in production facilities here, including the opening of a new facility at its plant in New Hampshire. The new plant came online in 2010 and, as a result, each phase of production from cocoa-bean roasting to the finished products can now be performed in the US.

   David Sprüngli-Schwarz and his son, Rudolf, founded Sprüngli &amp; Son, a small confectionery shop in Zurich, in 1845. They later moved the chocolate production to a factory and opened a second and larger shop. The business eventually passed to Rudolf, and he passed it to his two sons when he retired in 1892. But he split the business, giving the chocolate factory to the oldest son, Johann Rudolf, and the two shops to David Robert.
  </p>
        <p>
   Johann took his company public in 1899 to get sufficient funds to build a new and larger factory. He also made an important acquisition -- buying both Rodolphe Lindt's chocolate factory and Lindt's invention, a machine that mixed the liquid chocolate into an ultrasmooth blend. Lindt and two relatives stayed with Chocolat Sprüngli until retiring in 1905. However, contrary to an anti-compete agreement, August and Walter Lindt began their own chocolate factory, leading to legal proceedings that didn't end until A &amp; W Lindt closed more than 20 years later.
  </p>
        <p>
   By WWII Lindt &amp; Sprüngli had a manufacturing facility in England. After the war, the company developed licensing agreements in Italy, Germany, and France and began acquiring chocolate operations, first in Switzerland and later elsewhere in Europe.

   The late 1980s and early 1990s were marked by turmoil in the executive offices, with a handful of CEOs in some six years. CEO Ulrich Geissmann and other officers resigned in 1992 when Rudolph Sprüngli (the founder's great-great-grandson), then chairman and 72 years old, divorced his wife of 45 years and four months later secretly married a much younger woman who had been accused of meddling in company business. Takeover and buyout rumors abounded following the scandal. Ernst Tanner, former head of
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   's European division, was brought in to run the company late that year; he became chairman when Rudolph retired in 1994.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1994 the firm was reorganized as Chocoladefabriken Lindt &amp; Sprüngli, a holding company. It acquired Italian chocolate maker Caffarel in 1997 and Ghirardelli Chocolate Company in 1998. Caffarel, best known for its Gianduia 1865 line, began in 1826, while Ghirardelli got its start in San Francisco in 1852. Lindt &amp; Sprüngli recalled several chocolate products in 1999 because they contained undeclared traces of nuts, thus posing a hazard to those allergic to nuts. In 2000 the company sold its Ghirardelli factory in Wisconsin to Decobel, a subsidiary of Belgian confectioner Puratos.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2005 the company began operations at two new subsidiaries, one in Mexico and another in Sweden. It also introduced a new line of chocolate truffles called Surfin.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's honorary chairman Rudolph R. Sprüengli, son of the founding Lindt family, died in 2008 at the age of 88.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2009 the company reduced the number of LINDT boutiques in shopping malls as part of a retail restructuring.
  </p>
        <p>
   In June 2010 the company opeened a new factory building at its plant in Stratham, New Hampshire. The new facility produces cocoa mass which was previously imported from Switzerland.
  </p>
        <p>
   In May 2011 Ernst Tanner stepped down as CEO. Tanner, who led the company since 1993, was replaced by a newly-created "Extended Group Management" committee of four individuals.
