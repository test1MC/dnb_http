   The future looks black for Continental Carbon, and that just fine with this company which manufactures carbon black from three plants in Alabama, Oklahoma, and Texas. It has marketing and distribution operations in other areas of the US, and it has carbon black manufacturing subsidiaries in China, India, and Taiwan. Continental Carbon produces nearly 20 different grades of carbon black that are used for tires and other rubber and plastic products. Focused on the development of new carbon black products and applications, the company's Houston Technology Center supports current customers and products as well as Continental Carbon's sales and marketing teams.

   Expanding its global portfolio, in 2012 the company began the commercial production of Specialty Engineered Carbon Black at its Ghaziabad Plant, in Uttar Pradesh, India. (Continental Carbon India Limited was formed in 2000 through the acquisition by Continental Carbon of the carbon black assets of Oriental Carbon &amp; Chemicals Ltd. Continental Carbon then refurbished the carbon black manufacturing plant in Ghaziabad).

   In 2011 Continental Carbon signed a long-term technology licensing agreement with Saudi Basic Industries Corporation and Exxon Mobil's joint-venture partner, Al-Jubail Petrochemical Company (Kemya), for Continental Carbon's production technology related to the construction and operation of a new carbon black plant at Kemya's petrochemical complex at Al-Jubail, Saudi Arabia. Kemya and Continental Carbon also signed a long-term product off-take agreement. As part of the deal Continental Carbon agreed to market a portion of the Kemya carbon black plant's products.
