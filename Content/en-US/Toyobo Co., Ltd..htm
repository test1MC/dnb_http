   Toyobo is one of Japan's top makers of fibers and textiles, including synthetic fibers (polyester, nylon, acrylics) and natural fibers, such as cotton and wool. The company's textiles are designed for clothing, home furnishings, and for industrial uses. Its textiles include spandex yarn for apparel, polyurethane fiber for pantyhose, and yarns for airbags and tire cords. Toyobo also manufactures plastic films (industrial and packaging) and resins. Biochemical products (reagents and instruments), medical products (fiber membranes for artificial organs), and purification devices round out the company's primary manufacturing operations.

   Toyobo is expanding beyond its traditional fibers and textiles base. It has moved into more lucrative industries, including contract pharmaceuticals manufacturing, blood glucose monitoring devices, environmental systems, and electronics materials, among other things. The company is also continuing to reduce its fiber production and narrow its focus to produce more functional textiles such as those used in sportswear, work uniforms, and bedding linens.

  <p>
   In 2015 Toyobo's European subsidiary, TOYOBO Europe GmbH, signed a sponsorship agreement with the Parma Football Club, which is one of Italy's Serie A teams. Toyobo presented the Parma club with training mats containing BREATHAIR, which is a three-dimensional spring structure. Going forward, Toyobo will leverage this new relationship to expand sales of BREATHAIR.

   Streamlining its US operations, in 2013 the company merged New York-based subsidiaries Toyobo Specialties (USA) and Toyobo America, and renamed the expanded surviving company as Toyoba U.S.A.
