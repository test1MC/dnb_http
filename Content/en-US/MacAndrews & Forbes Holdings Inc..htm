  <p>
   Ron Perelman grew up working in his father's Philadelphia-based conglomerate, Belmont Industries, but he left at the age of 35 to seek his fortune in New York. In 1978 he bought 40% of jewelry store operator Cohen-Hatfield Industries. The next year Cohen-Hatfield bought a minority stake in MacAndrews &amp; Forbes (licorice flavoring). Cohen-Hatfield acquired MacAndrews &amp; Forbes in 1980.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1984 Perelman reshuffled his assets to create MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings, which acquired control of Pantry Pride, a Florida-based supermarket chain, in 1985. Pantry Pride then bought Revlon for $1.8 billion with the help of (convicted felon) Michael Milken. After Perelman acquired Revlon, he added several other cosmetics vendors, including Max Factor and Yves Saint Laurent's fragrance and cosmetic lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1988 MacAndrews &amp; Forbes agreed to invest $315 million in five failing Texas savings and loans (S&amp;Ls), which Perelman combined and named First Gibraltar (sold to BankAmerica, now
   <company id="58444">
    Bank of America
   </company>
   , in 1993). The next year MacAndrews &amp; Forbes bought The Coleman Company, a maker of outdoor equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   With a growing reputation for buying struggling companies, revamping them, and then selling them at a higher price, Perelman bought Marvel Entertainment Group (Marvel Comics) in 1989 and took it public in 1991. That year he sold Revlon's Max Factor and Betrix units to
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   for more than $1 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   MacAndrews &amp; Forbes acquired 38% of TV infomercial producer
   <company id="53299">
    Guthy-Renker
   </company>
   and SCI Television's seven stations and merged them to create New World Television. That company was combined with TV syndicator Genesis Entertainment and TV production house New World Entertainment to create New World Communications Group, which Perelman took public in 1994. That year MacAndrews &amp; Forbes and partner Gerald J. Ford bought Ford Motor's First Nationwide, the US's fifth-largest S&amp;L at that time.
  </p>
  <p>
   Subsidiaries Mafco Worldwide and Consolidated Cigar Holdings merged with Abex (aircraft parts) to create Mafco Consolidated Group in 1995. Following diminishing comic sales, Perelman placed Marvel in bankruptcy in 1996 and subsequently lost control of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 First Nationwide bought California thrift Cal Fed Bancorp for $1.2 billion. In addition, Perelman sold New World to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year Perelman orchestrated a $1.8 billion deal in which First Nationwide merged with Golden State Bancorp to form the US's third-largest thrift. Sunbeam Corp. (now American Household) bought Perelman's stake in Coleman that year, making Perelman a major American Household shareholder. Also in 1998 MacAndrews &amp; Forbes bought a 72% stake in Panavision (movie camera maker, later increased to 91%), invested in WeddingChannel.com, and sold its 64% stake in Consolidated Cigar to French tobacco giant Seita (netting Perelman a smoking $350 million profit).
  </p>
  <p>
   Still burdened by debt, Revlon sold its professional products business in 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   Perelman's stock in American Household was rendered worthless when the company initiated bankruptcy proceedings in February 2001. (It would emerge from bankruptcy, however, in December 2002.) He also was sued by angry shareholders after the board of M&amp;F Worldwide, the licorice company he controls, bought Perelman's stock in Panavision at more than five times its market value. In order to settle the litigation surrounding the purchase, in 2002 M&amp;F agreed to return Perelman's 83% stake in Panavision to Mafco. Golden State Bancorp also left the MacAndrews fold in 2002 when it was acquired by Citigroup.
  </p>
  <p>
   MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings acquired Allied Security, the largest independent provider of contract security services and products in the US, from Gryphon Investors in February 2003 for an undisclosed sum.
  </p>
  <p>
   Perelman's sale of The Coleman Company -- in the late 1990s -- helped the investor improve his cash flow later on. In his suit against
   <company id="15970">
    Morgan Stanley
   </company>
   , Perelman alleged that the investment bank withheld its knowledge of Sunbeam's accounting fraud when Perelman sold The Coleman Company to Sunbeam in 1998 for about $1.5 billion. Perelman's investment (he held 14.1 million shares of Sunbeam stock as part of the sale) later tanked as news broke of the accounting irregularities. Despite an attempt to settle the dispute with Morgan Stanley in 2003 for $20 million, Perelman took the bank to court and was awarded more than $1.5 billion in damages by a Florida jury in mid-2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   It bought
   <company id="108917">
    Deluxe Entertainment Services Group
   </company>
   from
   <company id="41829">
    The Rank Group
   </company>
   for some $750 million in 2006. The purchase complements its majority stake in
   <company id="52406">
    Panavision
   </company>
   , the top provider of cameras for shooting movies and TV shows. Deluxe has operations in Hollywood, Rome, and London.
  </p>
  <p>
   Around the time of his public breakup with wife #4, actress Ellen Barkin, Perelman's MacAndrews &amp; Forbes sold
   <company id="61316">
    WeddingChannel.com
   </company>
   to
   <company id="61309">
    XO Group
   </company>
   (formerly The Knot) in late 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold
   <company id="103818">
    Allied Security Holdings
   </company>
   (dba AlliedBarton Security Services) to private equity firm
   <company id="43093">
    Blackstone Group
   </company>
   for $750 million in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   Intent on reversing the fortunes of once languishing Revlon, which Perelman has controlled since 1985, the company in 2009 boosted its holding in the cosmetics maker from about 60% to 80%. In a stock exchange MacAndrews &amp; Forbes contributed about $50 million to the principal of a nearly $110 million loan to Revlon. The firm also extended the maturity date of the loan until 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Known for its diverse holdings, MacAndrews &amp; Forbes has unloaded investments when it saw fit. The company sold its significant shareholdings in Panavision, the top provider of cameras for movies and TV shows, in 2010 to a consortium of investors that included Cerberus Capital Management.
  </p>
  <p>
   In December 2011 the company completed a merger agreement with M&amp;F Worldwide that saw MacAndrews &amp; Forbes acquire the 57% of M&amp;F stock it didn't already own for $25 per share in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Harland Clarke Holdings Corp. subsidiary acquired all the outstanding shares of Valassis for $34 per share in cash or about $1.84 billion. As part of the move, Harland Clarke Holdings inked a deal to sell its Harland Financial Solutions subsidiary, which accounted for about 15% of its 2012 business, to Davis + Henderson Corporation for $1.2 billion in cash.
