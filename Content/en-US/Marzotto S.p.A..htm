   Marzotto's reputation is made out of whole cloth. Manifattura Lane Gaetano Marzotto &amp; Figli and its affiliates are returning to their roots and concentrating on the textile side of the company's business, after having spun off Italian haute couture fashion house Valentino and other apparel-related operations into a separate company, called
   <company id="139260">
    Valentino Fashion Group
   </company>
   , in 2005. Textile operations remaining under the Marzotto flag include production of woolen and linen fabrics, yarns, and linens and blankets. Some of Marzotto's companies include Fratelli Tallia di Delfina, Estethia, and Lanificio G.B. Conte. The Marzotto family controls the company, which Luigi Marzotto founded in 1836.

  <p>
   Luigi Marzotto opened a woolen mill in 1836 in Valdagno, in Italy's Veneto region. Luigi's son, Gaetano, took over in 1840, and by 1866 the company had grown to 200 employees.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gaetano opened a new spinning mill in 1880 to produce worsted (long-fiber) wool. About this time the company moved into exporting, and between 1889 and 1910 the company's labor force grew from 600 to 2,000. In the 1950s Manifattura Lane G. Marzotto &amp; Figli began making clothing.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1980s Marzotto began growing through acquisitions. Its purchases included Bassetti (later sold to Zucchi for a 23% interest in that company) and Lanerossi (woolens, under Italy's privatization program). In 1988 Marzotto began producing Marlboro-branded Western sportswear under license from cigarette maker Philip Morris. Three years later the company bought control of German suit maker Hugo Boss. Marzotto bought Czech woolen mill Nova Mosilana in 1994.

   A deal to merge with Fiat's fashion holdings foundered in 1997 over organizational and control issues. The next year fifth-generation chairman Pietro Marzotto retired and was succeeded by company veteran Jean de Jaegher, who had rehabilitated Hugo Boss.
  </p>
  <p>
   Marzotto created a new "bridge" men's suit line, Marzotto Sartoriale, for the US market in 1999. In 2001 Marzotto announced plans to move more of its production to lower-cost Eastern Europe. In a further shift from textiles to fashion, Marzotto bought fashion house Valentino from

   </company>
   in May 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   Turmoil appeared in 2003 for the Marzotto family, involving a split in interests; as a result, the family formed a new shareholders' pact excluding patriarch Pietro Marzotto. Mr. Marzotto and some other family members sold off their stakes in the company in mid-2004 -- a total of about 17% ownership. Investment group Finanziaria Canova bought the shares, bringing its stake up to about 28% of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Marzotto closed out 2004 with the announcement of plans to split the business into two separate entities, one focusing on the textile business, and the other focusing on apparel. The fashion businesses were spun off into the Valentino Fashion Group in mid-2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2005 Marzotto formed a 50/50 joint venture with Verzoletto for manufacturing woolen yarns, producing pure wool, acrylic blends, and carded knitwear.
