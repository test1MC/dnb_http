  <p>
   Whirlpool operates four geographic business segments: North America, which accounted for 51% of sales in 2015 and includes appliances sold in the US under the Whirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid, Jenn-Air brands; EMEA (26% of sales), which counts appliances sold in the EMEA region under the KitchenAid, Whirlpool, Indesit, and Hotpoint brands; Latin America (16% of sales), which sells appliances under the Consul, Brastemp, Whirlpool, and KitchenAid brands; and Asia (7% of sales), which sells appliances across China, India, the Oceania region, Southeast Asia, and Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   By product line, Laundry Appliance, and Refrigerators &amp; Freezer sales each made up nearly 30% of the company's total sales during 2015, while Cooking Appliances generated another roughly 20%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Whirlpool's manufacturing plant in Cleveland, Tennessee is the world's largest premium cooking plant, and produces cooking products, including ranges, ovens, and cooktops. Whirlpool also sells home appliances in China through a strategic alliance with Suning Appliance Co., Ltd.

  <p>
   Whirlpool sells its products globally, and has some 70 manufacturing and technology research centers throughout the world. About 44% of Whirlpool's revenue came from sales in the US during 2015, while sales in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region brought in another 26%. Other large markets include Latin America (16% of total sales, with more than half of that coming from Brazil) and Asia (7% of sales).

   Whirlpool distributes its products to several big-name retail customers, including:

   , and
   <company id="178350">
    Alno
   </company>
   . In North America, the company sells products to other manufacturers, distributors, builders, and retailers for resale under those manufacturers' and retailers' brand names.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company spent $310 million on advertising in 2015, up from the $269 million and $304 million spent in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The manufacturer's revenues and profits have been steadily rising over the past few years as it's continued to expand its global distribution with acquisitions and cut its operating expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Whirlpool's net sales climbed 5% to $20.89 billion during 2015 despite unfavorable foreign exchange rates and weakened demand in emerging markets, mostly thanks to higher sales volumes from acquisitions and a favorable product price/mix. A 43% rise in EMEA segment sales drove most of the growth, with the acquisition of Indesit and a favorable product mix in the region to thank. North American sales were up 1% on higher unit sales volumes and favorable product/price mix, while sales in Asia spiked 74% thanks to the Hefei Sanyo acquisition. Sales in Latin America plummeted 29% as it sold 20% fewer units and suffered from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.
  </p>
  <p>
   Strong revenue growth in 2015 drove Whirlpool's net income up 20% to $783 million. The company's operating cash levels slipped 17% to $1.23 billion due to unfavorable working capital changes related to the timing of payments, and because the company spent $72 million to fund its US qualified pension plans.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company is looking to improve its operating margins and earnings by implementing cost-based price increases, initiating cost reduction efforts, and making productivity improvements. During 2015, the company spent $201 million toward restructuring its operations after spending $136 million in 2014, which included the shuttering of a microwave oven manufacturing facility in the EMEA region. It has also closed some domestic facilities in the past few years. For 2016, it plans to spend another $200 million on restructuring to boost operating efficiency.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the same time, these cost savings are intended to allow the company to spend more on R&amp;D for new product innovation and the improvement of existing products. Indeed, Whirlpool spent $579 million on R&amp;D in 2015, up from $532 million in 2010. In 2014, the company launched a new sustainable product, its Whirlpool HybridCare clothes dryer, which features a ventless heat pump dryer that uses less energy. Whirlpool is also implementing the usage of energy-efficient insulation from
   <company id="10062">
    Honeywell
   </company>
   in the production of its domestic refrigerators and freezers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Whirlpool plans to pursue longer-term growth from certain emerging markets -- China and India in particular -- by making strategic partnerships and acquisitions to expand its global manufacturing centers. It recently entered into a strategic alliance with China's Suning Appliance Co. to sell home appliances there. As part of the agreement, Whirlpool enjoys access to some of China's smaller, fast-growing cities through Suning's national distribution network of 1,700 retail outlets. Its 2014 acquisitions of manufacturers Hefei Sanyo and Indesit strengthened the company's distribution reach even further in China and the EMEA region, respectively.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In July 2015, the appliance manufacturer expanded its commercial laundry lines after buying privately-held American Dryer Corporation, which manufactured coin-operated, on premise industrial and specialty laundry equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In December 2014, the company acquired a majority stake in Italian manufacturer
   <company id="92695">
    Indesit
   </company>
   for approximately $1.4 billion. The deal broadened Whirlpool's production presence in the EMEA region.
  </p>
  <p>
   In October 2014, Whirlpool acquired a majority stake in Hefei Sanyo,
   <company id="41882">
    Sanyo Electric
   </company>
   's joint venture based in Hefei, China. The move made Whirlpool a 51% shareholder and further strengthened its production presence in sought-after China.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Brothers Fred and Lou Upton and their uncle, Emory Upton, founded the Upton Machine Company, manufacturer of electric motor-driven washing machines, in 1911 in St. Joseph, Michigan. Sears, Roebuck and Co. began buying their products five years later, and by 1925 the company was supplying all of Sears' washers. The Uptons combined their company with the Nineteen Hundred Washer Company in 1929 to form the Nineteen Hundred Corporation, the world's largest washing machine company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sears and Nineteen Hundred prospered during the Great Depression, and during WWII Nineteen Hundred's factories produced war materials. In 1948 it began selling its first automatic washing machine (introduced a year earlier) under the Whirlpool brand. In 1950 the company changed its name to Whirlpool following the success of the product and introduced its first automatic dryer.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1950s and 1960s, Whirlpool became a full-line appliance manufacturer while continuing as Sears' principal Kenmore appliance supplier. In 1955 the company bought Seeger Refrigerator Company and the stove and air-conditioning interests of RCA. Three years later it made its first investment in
   <company id="96501">
    Multibras Eletrodomésticos
   </company>
   , an appliance maker in Brazil. (It has increased that investment over the years.) Other purchases included the gas refrigeration and ice-maker manufacturing facilities of Servel (1958); a majority interest in Heil-Quaker, makers of central heaters and space heaters (1964); Sears' major television set supplier, Warwick Electronics (1966); and 33% of Canadian appliance maker John Inglis Company (1969). It made a deal with
   <company id="41885">
    Sony
   </company>
   in 1973 for the distribution of Whirlpool-brand products in Japan. Whirlpool sold its TV manufacturing business to
   <company id="41882">
    SANYO
   </company>
   of Japan three years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   Between 1981 and 1991, despite a static US market, Whirlpool's sales tripled to almost $6.6 billion. In 1986 the firm bought top-end appliance manufacturer KitchenAid (from Dart and
   <company id="103392">
    Kraft
   </company>
   ) and 65% of Italian cooling compressor manufacturer Aspera. Also that year it sold its Heil-Quaker central heating business. David Whitwam was appointed CEO in 1987. Whirlpool took over total ownership of Inglis in 1990.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company formed Whirlpool Europe, a joint venture with
   <company id="41823">
    Philips Electronics
   </company>
   , in 1989; in 1991 it bought out Philips. Two years later Whirlpool took control of appliance marketer SAGAD of Argentina and entered a joint venture with Slovakia's Tatramat (which it bought out in 1994).
  </p>
  <p>
   Whirlpool acquired control of Kelvinator of India in 1994 and formed a joint venture in China with Shenzhen Petrochemical Holdings in 1995 to produce air conditioners. The following year Whirlpool merged its Whirlpool Washing Machines and Kelvinator of India companies to form Whirlpool of India. The company's European division plunged into the red when competition and a recession kept consumers away from its higher-priced appliances.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Whirlpool initiated a restructuring (due to losses from its foreign operations) that included plant closures and substantial layoffs (as much as 10% of its workforce). The next year Whirlpool sold its appliance financing subsidiary to Transamerica. The company also began using a new, more efficient product development model in 1998, similar to one used in the auto industry. In 2000 Whirlpool launched the Cielo Bath line of jetted tubs, and in 2001 it introduced the Calypso dishwasher and the Duet washer and dryer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another global restructuring plan swept through the company in 2000, resulting in significant pretax charges ($373 million, incurred in 2001 and 2002) and the elimination of about 6,000 employees by October 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   In February 2002 Whirlpool bought the remaining 51% of Vitromatic it didn't already own. (Vitromatic -- the second-largest appliance manufacturer in Mexico -- is now called Whirlpool Mexico.) In March the company purchased 95% of Polar, Poland's second-largest appliance maker.
  </p>
  <p>
   Whirlpool introduced Gladiator GarageWorks (modular storage systems for the garage) and Polara (the first electric range with cooking and refrigeration capabilities) in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   Whirlpool acquired Maytag in early 2006 for about $1.9 billion. The deal added several top brands to its already bulging portfolio, including Admiral, Amana, Jenn-Air, Magic Chef, and of course, the eponymous Maytag. Once the dust settled, Whirlpool sold several businesses, including Dixie-Narco, the Amana commercial business, its Hoover unit to
   <company id="107661">
    Techtronic Industries
   </company>
   , and its Jade unit to
   <company id="12154">
    Middleby Corporation
   </company>
   . Buying Maytag also spurred Whirlpool to streamline operations and purge staff. In 2006 it laid off some 4,500 employees, consolidated duplicate functions related to administration and manufacturing, and shuttered some offices, including a Maytag research and development center based in Newton, Illinois. Whirlpool shuttered Maytag's Iowa-based administrative offices and moved them to Michigan and other locations. The company cut 700 jobs at several Tennessee plants the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Whirlpool acquired a minority stake in Elica Group in its effort to extend its reach into the global air ventilation market.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company formed a 50-50 joint venture in 2008 with China's Hisense-Kelon Electrical Holdings to make and sell home appliances there.
  </p>
  <p>
   In June 2010 Whirlpool closed its refrigerator factory in Evansville, Indiana; some 1,100 US jobs were lost as a result of the move.
