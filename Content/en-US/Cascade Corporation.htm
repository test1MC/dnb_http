   Cascade makes light work out of heavy weights. The company's materials-handling products -- attachments, forks, and related accessories -- are made for industrial and commercial lift trucks, and, occasionally, construction and agricultural vehicles. Cascade distributes an array of sizes, models, and process capabilities in its line of forklift attachments, handling forks, hydraulic cylinders, as well as replacement parts. The equipment pulls, rotates, tilts, side shifts, clamps, and lifts materials as heavy as major appliances and as mountainous as industrial rolls of paper. In 2013 Cascade was acquired by
   <company id="57050">
    Toyota Industries Corporation
   </company>
   , a global builder of forklifts and related lift trucks.

   Cascade was bought by Toyota Industries in a transaction valued at $759 million in March 2013. Toyota made the deal to broaden the variety of lift trucks that it offers customers. Cascade is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota Industries and caters to OEMs and original equipment dealers (OEDs) of lift trucks in North America, Europe, China, and the Asia/Pacific region.
