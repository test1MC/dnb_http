   Poultry is always on the menu at this company. Perdue Farms is one of the nation's largest producers of chicken and turkey. The company operates live production and processing facilities in about 15 US states through its about 2,200 contracted poultry farmers. It processes and packs more than 3 billion pounds of chicken and turkey a year. The company sells poultry and pork in the US and in 100-plus countries through retail food outlets and to foodservice customers, most of which are located in the eastern half of the US. Begun in 1920 as a chicken farm, Perdue is still family-owned and -operated.

   Perdue continues to strengthen its position in the consumer poultry market through acquisitions and new product innovations, such as frozen and fully-cooked poultry products designed for busy families (and FUN SHAPES Nuggets for the kids). The company has responded to consumer concerns about food quality, trumpeting its "Farm-to-Fork" production and processing capabilities, as well as its antibiotic-free products. It also offers safe-food handling tips on its website.

   In 2015 Perdue acquired Natural Food Holdings, including its Niman Ranch brand. Niman Ranch began in the early 1970s on a small ranch in California and has grown to include more than 700 independent family farmers and ranchers spread across the country. The Niman Ranch brand covers a complete line of pork, beef, lamb, cage-free eggs, and a variety of smoked and cured meats. Perdue also acquired the Prairie Grove brand and the SiouxPreme Packing plants in Sioux City and Sioux Center, Iowa.

  <p>
   Perdue uses its own breed of chicken, the skin of which is a distinct yellow color, resulting from a diet that includes marigold petals. Arthur Perdue started the family-owned business in 1920.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   If asked which came first, the chickens or the eggs, the Perdue family will tell you the eggs did. Arthur Perdue, a railroad express worker, bought 23 layer hens in 1920 and started supplying the New York City market with eggs from a henhouse in his family's backyard in Salisbury, Maryland. His son Frank joined the business in 1939.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Perdues sold broiling chickens to major processors, such as Swift and Armour, in the 1940s and pioneered chicken crossbreeding to develop new breeds. The family started contracting with farmers in the Salisbury area in 1950 to grow broilers for them. Frank became president of the company in 1952. The next year it began mixing its own feed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Frank persuaded his father to borrow money to build a soybean mill in 1961. (Arthur had not willingly gone into debt in his previous 40-plus years in the poultry industry.) The soybean mill was part of Frank's plan to vertically integrate the company -- with grain storage facilities, feed milling operations, soybean processing plants, mulch plants, hatcheries, and 600 contract chicken farmers -- to counter the threat of processors buying chickens directly from farmers rather than through middlemen like the Perdues. To differentiate their products, the Perdue name was applied to packages on retail meat counters in 1968.
  </p>
  <p>
   Two years later the company began a breeding and genetic research program. During the following years Frank transformed himself from country chicken salesman to media poultry pitchman when the company decided to use him as spokesperson in its print, radio, and TV ads. Catchy slogans ("It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken") combined with Frank's whiny voice and sincere face helped sales. As Perdue Farms expanded geographically into new eastern markets such as Philadelphia, Boston, and Baltimore, it acquired the broiler facilities of other processors.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1983 James Perdue, Frank's only son, joined the company as a management trainee. In 1984 Perdue added processors in Virginia and Indiana and introduced turkey products. Two years later it acquired Intertrade, a feed broker, and FoodCraft, a food equipment maker. However, after enjoying a rising demand for poultry by a health-conscious society in the 1970s and early 1980s, the company found its sales leveling off in the late 1980s. When North Carolina fined Perdue for unsafe working conditions in 1989, the company increased its emphasis on safety.
  </p>
  <p>
   James, who had become chairman of the board in 1991, replaced his folksy father in 1994 as the company's spokesman in TV ads. In the early 1990s Perdue's management determined future sales growth lay in foodservice and international sales; therefore, the poultry company quietly began laying the groundwork to support these new markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Perdue launched its Cafe Perdue entree meal kits in 1997. The following year it purchased foodservice poultry processor Gol-Pak and, through a joint venture, opened a poultry processing plant in Shanghai, China.
  </p>
  <p>
   Settlements to chicken catchers and line workers in 2001 and 2002 cost the company over $12 million in back wages. Also in 2002 Perdue announced it would be shuttering a deboning plant purchased only three years earlier. During 2003 the company started work on a new research and development facility in Salisbury, Maryland. In January 2004 Perdue purchased a poultry processing facility from competitor

  </p>
  <p>
   Frank Perdue died in 2005. He was 84.
