   Inventure Foods caters to avid snackers and the more health conscious alike. The company's Rader Farms business grows and processes berries and produces frozen fruits, vegetables, and beverages for sale primarily to grocery and club stores, and mass merchandisers. The snack business makes potato and other snack chips, pretzels, and more under Bob's Texas Style, Braids, Poore Brothers, Boulder Canyon Natural Foods, to name a few. Inventure Foods also makes salted snacks branded with the

   and Nathan's Famous names, and manufactures private label snacks for food stores in the US.

   is the company's #1 customer. With roots in salty snacks, Inventure is now focused on healthier fare.

  <p>
   Phoenix-based Inventure Foods operates manufacturing facilities in Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Oregon, and Washington. While the company sells its products in both the US and Canada, the US accounts for essentially all of its sales.

  <p>
   Inventure Foods operates two segments: frozen products and snack foods. The frozen products business produces frozen fruits, vegetables, and beverages, which are sold primarily to grocery stores, club stores, and mass merchandisers. Brands include Rader Farms, Boulder Canyon Natural Foods, and Willamette Valley Fruit Co. (Products in the company's healthy/natural category account for about two-thirds of Inventure's annual sales.) The snack segment makes potato and kettle chips, potato crisps, pellet snacks, sheeted dough products and extruded products for sale primarily to snack food distributors and retailers. Products in Inventure's indulgent specialty snack food category include T.G.I. Friday's, and Nathan's Famous brand snacks (both under license), and Poore Brothers kettle cooked potato chips, Tato Skins, and other brands.

   <company id="17060">
    Costco Wholesale
   </company>
   is the company's biggest customer, accounting for 35% of net sales in 2013. Indeed, 27% of 2013 net revenue was attributable to Rader Farms/Kirkland co-branded frozen berry product sales to Costco. The remainder comes from sales to grocery chains, club stores, regional distributors, and other manufacturers.

  <p>
   Inventure Foods reported sales of $215.6 million in 2013, an increase of 16% versus 2012. The double-digit gain was driven primarily by an increase in sales by the frozen products segment, and, to a lesser extent, snack products. ((Products in the company's healthy/natural category accounted for 67% of Inventure's total 2013 sales, an increase of 6% versus 21012.) Indeed, 2013 marked the seventh consecutive year of growing sales for the company, which have tripled from just shy of $70 million in 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite rising sales, net income declined by 11% in 2013 versus 2012, to $6.6 million, on higher operating and interest expenses.

  <p>
   While Inventure Foods is growing its healthy/natural foods business, it's reluctant to leave salty snacks behind -- although its focus of late is on healthier snack foods, including the Boulder Canyon brand. The $20.9-million purchase of Rader Farms (in 2007) launched Inventure's effort to move beyond its core business as a salty snack-food manufacturer. (Rader grows, processes, freezes, and markets raspberries, blueberries, rhubarb, and berry blends. It also purchases marionberries, cherries, cranberries, and strawberries from fruit growers for processing and sale.) In 2013, the company continued to build its portfolio of higher-margin healthy/natural foods with a pair of acquisitions. Also, to fund future purchases, in 2014 the company filed a shelf registration that allows it to increase the number of shares outstanding, up to $100 million worth.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the salty side of the business, Inventure in 20143 signed a long-term licensing agreement (ending 2024), which included international distribution and expended product line rights with T.G.I. Friday's. That deal followed another signed in 2013 with Vidalia Brands, that resulted in a new line of snacks.

  <p>
   In November 2013, Inventure Foods acquired Fresh Frozen Foods, a processor and packager of vegetables, breads, and other items sold under the Fresh Frozen brands, for $38.4 million. In May 2013, the company bought Willamette Valley Fruit Co., which packages marionberries, other blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, and other types of berries, fruits, and vegetables at two plants in Oregon, for $9.5 million in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012, the company sold its direct-store-delivery (DSD) business for $1.2 million.
