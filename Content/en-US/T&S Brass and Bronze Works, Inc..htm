   In 2014 T&amp;S introduced a new product to its already extensive line of hose reels and washdown solutions. The Compact Light-Duty Hose Reel, Model B-7161-C, features a stainless steel cabinet with 6-foot (182.88 cm), durable, reinforced hose, single-stream spray valve and easy-access shut-off valve. That year the company teamed up with Everpure, the world's largest water treatment equipment manufacturer, which agreed to package popular T&amp;S products with a point-of-use EverPure water filtration system.
