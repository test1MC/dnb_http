   And then there was light, the metal halide kind. Made by Advanced Lighting Technologies (ADLT), metal halide simulates sunlight more closely and efficiently than other technologies. ADLT subsidiary Venture Lighting produces metal halide lamps and ballast systems. Its lineup includes lamp components, power supplies, and lamp-making equipment for commercial and industrial markets. ADLT's Materials segment makes the metal halide salts used in its products as well as sells the salts to other manufacturers. Via its

   Despite its depth, ADLT is impacted by the fluctuating costs of raw materials, such as glass, which are often difficult to pass on to customers. After reaching record highs in 2008, Auer Lighting, another ADLT company, opened a glass processing plant in India in 2009. ADLT had purchased Auer Lighting GmbH from

   , in 2007. Auer Lighting strengthened ADLT's portfolio with particular expertise in building general and specialized lighting components for digital projection, stage, medical, and automotive lighting.

   ADLT's direction is a reflection of both its past financial troubles and current ownership. The company emerged from Chapter 11 in late 2003 after refinancing was provided by Saratoga Lighting Holdings, an affiliate of the New York-based
