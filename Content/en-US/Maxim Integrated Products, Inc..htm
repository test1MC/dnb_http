   Maxim Integrated Products makes analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs). The company's chips -- which include amplifiers, data converters, transceivers, and switching ICs -- translate physical data such as temperature, pressure, and sound into signals for electronic processing. The company serves five major end-markets: automotive, industrial, communications, consumer, and computing. Its ICs are used in products such as appliances, telecommunications and networking gear, automobiles, medical devices, instruments, and utility meters. Some 70% of sales come from customers located in Asia, mostly in China. Maxim has developed more than 80% of its products in-house.

  <p>
   Maxim has manufacturing facilities in the Philippines, Thailand, and the US. Wafer assembly and testing is performed by subcontractors in Asia. While it continues to increase its manufacturing capacity, Maxim has been relying more on partner foundries, such as
   <company id="43493">
    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
   </company>
   and
   <company id="55160">
    Seiko Epson
   </company>
   , for wafer supply. The percentage of products made by these partners has risen dramatically in the last few years, from less than a tenth in fiscal 2009 to about 66% in 2016 (ended June.)

  <p>
   Maxim has about 50 technology centers and more than 20 sales offices throughout the world. Some 70% of its sales originate in Asia (China is the biggest single country market with 38% of revenue originating there); the US and Europe combine account for 27% of sales.

  <p>
   Maxim's products are sold mostly as individual purchase orders through distribution channels, but also through a direct sales staff. Distributors, such as
   <company id="10151">
    Avnet
   </company>
   , are responsible for about 38% of revenue. Distributor Avnet individually represents 19% of sales. Maxim's largest end-user customer,
   <company id="41463">
    Samsung
   </company>
   , accounts for 14% of sales; it buys directly Maxim and through distributors.

  <p>
   Maxim's sales slipped 5% in 2016 (ended June) to $2.2 billion from $2.3 billion in 2015 with weaker sales in communications and data center and consumer areas. Lower demand for server, base station and data storage products clipped communications and data center revenue while a slowdown in smartphone sales reduced sales of Maxim's consumer chips. Automotive remained a bright spot for Maxim, posting a 32% sales increase in 2016 from 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income rose about 10% to $227 million in 2016 with help from operating income other than that from chips. Maxim sold its energy metering business to Silergy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Maxim's operating cash flow rose 4% to $722 million in 2016 from $694 million in 2015, because of a bigger profit and changes in working capital.

  <p>
   In 2014 and 2015 Maxim restructured operations. In 2014 the company closed its San Jose wafer fab. In its 2015 reorganization the company cut jobs and closed duplicate facilities, taking a $24 million charge.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, Maxim continued to shed its US manufacturing operations. Having sold its plant in San Antonio, it proceeded with plans to close its Dallas wafer level packaging manufacturing facilities and shut down the San Jose, California wafer fabrication facility. The company's move from fixed cost product model to a variable cost model by outsourcing manufacturing resulted in lower production and inventory costs in 2016. It moved some work to a plant in Oregon, which was refitted for more efficiency.

  <p>
   Maxim made no acquisition in 2015 or 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   In October 2013 Maxim completed its acquisition of Volterra Semiconductor for a cash and stock deal valued at $605 million. Volterra's low-voltage power supply chips complement Maxim's product offerings in the high-current technology market. Before the Volterra deal, Maxim had been focused on divesting noncore operations. In early 2013 it sold its video processing product line to GEO Semiconductor, Inc. The year before it sold its clock synchronization business to an undisclosed buyer for $44 million. It also sold technologies that hadn't yet been incorporated into products for $15 million.

   Jack Gifford, a former
   <company id="129257">
    UCLA
   </company>
   baseball star who began his career at
   <company id="53008">
    Fairchild Semiconductor
   </company>
   and later headed the Intersil subsidiary (later divested) of
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   , founded Maxim in 1983. Gifford focused on analog chips, which were less vulnerable to Japanese competition than digital integrated circuits (ICs), had a longer product life, and cost less to make. Maxim went public in 1988.
  </p>
  <p>
   From the beginning Maxim emphasized research and development: Gifford's 1983 business plan set the ambitious goal of developing at least 15 new products each quarter. The company developed 479 new products between 1993 and 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 Maxim bought
   <company id="11444">
    Tektronix
   </company>
   's IC business, and the two companies formed the Maxtek joint venture, a maker of multichip modules and hybrid circuits. For the rest of the decade, Maxim focused on expanding and modernizing its manufacturing. It opened offices in Hong Kong, South Korea, and Singapore in 1996, and added factories in the Philippines and California in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   Maxim released 250 new products in fiscal 1998, including breakthrough chips for portable computers, flat-panel displays, and paging. Maxim sold its half of Maxtek to Tektronix in 2000. That year it also introduced a record 383 products, and broke ground for a testing facility in Thailand.
