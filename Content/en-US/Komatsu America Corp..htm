   ), manufactures, sells, and maintains earthmoving machinery for the North American construction and mining markets. Komatsu America divides its operations into utility equipment (compact construction equipment) and mining systems. Its products include dump trucks, backhoes, crushers, graders, hydraulic excavators, crawler carriers, wheel loaders, bulldozers, and a computer-based mine management system. The company also provides financing, and rents and sells equipment through its sales subsidiaries and distributors.

  <p>
   Komatsu America operates a network of facilities in the US and Canada dedicated to the manufacture and sale of equipment and parts for the North American market. Its parent operates in more than 150 countries.

  <p>
   The company manufactures, remanufactures, and distributes Komatsu products. It is also engaged in training, marketing, and financing. More than 90% of the equipment it sells is made and/or assembled in the US. (The balance is imported from Japan.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Komatsu America's mining division is North America's second largest supplier of mining equipment, from hydraulic excavators to wheel loaders and crawler carriers. The Komatsu utility division supplies construction, utility, and rental products, including the Komatsu loader, dozer, truck, shovel, grader, and modular mining lines. The equipment industry is courted through an ongoing series of product launches touted for optimized productivity, operator comfort, and added-value applications. Among several entrants, the company has rolled out a hybrid hydraulic excavator, distinguished not only for its muscle, but for fuel economy and reduced CO2 emissions.

   With the US economy on the rebound, the company is launching new products to meet growing demand.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Komatsu America introduced the new D65PXi-18, the latest addition to the next generation of intelligent machine control and dozer technology; the PC390LC-11 hydraulic excavator,which comes equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it also introduced its latest articulated dump truck, a 44-tonner with a redesigned dash control panel as well as a Tier 4 Final engine the heavy equipment manufacturer says reduces fuel consumption and operating costs
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Komatsu America's Forestry Division launched the new high capacity C144 Harvesting Head, the second model in its new C-series family of 'carry-style' heads. It is available installed on Komatsu 931.1 and 941.1 Harvesters, and can be installed on other carriers as a loose head.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it also launched the new WA200-7 wheel 126-horsepower loader, which provides a 3-percent reduction in fuel usage compared to the previous model, the WA200-6.

  <p>
   The economic recession and accompanying slump in housing starts and infrastructure development eroded its sales in North America in the late 2000s. In response the company increased the price tag of its equipment as well as trimmed inventories on distributor lots. Komatsu also responded by consolidating its sales operations and production facilities; the Candiac Manufacturing Operation, Forklift USA, and Komatsu Forest have shuttered, with work transferred to Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Newberry South Carolina
  </p>
  <p>
   Komatsu America began operations in 1970.
