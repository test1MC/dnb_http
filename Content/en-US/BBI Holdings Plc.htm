   After enjoying a licensing agreement together, Alere (then known as Inverness Medical Innovations) acquired BBI Holdings in 2008. It then merged BBI's consumer health business with Cedar Health, a division of its BioStat subsidiary; the combined operations became known as BBI Healthcare.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prior to being acquired, BBI itself expanded through a steady process of acquisitions. It was first formed by Cardiff University researcher John Chandler in 1986 as Biocell Research Laboratories, later becoming known as British Biocell International.
