   Kubota has been the hand that turns the earth's soil for over a century. The diversified enterprise is Japan's largest maker of tractors and farm equipment, from rice transplanters to combine harvesters. It also leads in producing iron ductile pipe for water supply systems. Industrial castings (ductile tunnel segments) are part of Kubota's line, too, as well as PVC pipe, the engines for its agricultural and industrial movers, and vending machines for cigarettes and beverages. To support equipment sales by dealers, it provides retail finance and finance leases. The company has also entered into building environmental control plants and pumps. International sales subsidiaries dot the globe.

  <p>
   Kubota manufactures its products not only in Japan but also in overseas countries like the US, Germany, China, Thailand, and other countries. It sells its products in Japan, North America, Europe, Asia, and other countries. Japan is the company's largest market, generating 42% of net sales. Other major markets include North America (24%), Asia countries outside Japan (19%), Europe (12%), and other regions (3%).

  <p>
   Kubota's revenues climbed 25% from 2013 to 2014. The growth was fueled by rises across all its segments: farm and industrial machinery (29%), water and environment (11%), and other (20%). Its net income also spiked 69% from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to the boost in revenue.

  <p>
   Kubota is focused on accelerating its position in the agricultural machinery market for upland farming as well as its development of water and environment activities mainly in Asia in order to achieve growth. Thus far, Kubota has expanded its overseas business activities based on the success in the agricultural machinery for rice paddy cultivation in Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   In other business sectors, Kubota is keeping a close eye on sanitation and wastewater management opportunities, triggered by rising pollution and water shortages in Asia. Construction activity, too, in regions outside of Japan, has increased and consequently a rise in demand for Kubota's environmental waste lineup, along with its ductile iron pipes and construction machinery.

  <p>
   The son of a poor farmer and coppersmith, Gonshiro Oode left home in 1885 at age 14 and moved to Osaka to find work. He began as an apprentice at the Kuro Casting Shop, where he learned about metal casting. He saved his money and in 1890 opened Oode Casting.
  </p>
  <p>
   Oode's shop grew rapidly, thanks to the industrialization of the Japanese economy and the expansion of the iron and steel industries. One of Oode's customers, Toshiro Kubota, took a liking to the hardworking young man, and in 1897 Kubota adopted him. Oode changed his own name to Kubota and also changed the name of his company to Kubota Iron Works.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kubota made a number of technological breakthroughs in the early 1900s, including a new method of producing cast-iron pipe (developed in 1900). The company became the first to make the pipe in Japan, and it continued to grow as the country modernized its infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kubota began making steam engines, machine tools, and agricultural engines in 1917, and it also began exporting products to countries in Southeast Asia. In 1930 Kubota restructured and incorporated. It continued to add product lines, including agricultural and industrial motors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although WWII brought massive destruction to Japan, the peacetime that followed created plenty of work for Kubota's farm equipment and pipe operations as the country rebuilt. By 1960 the company was Japan's largest maker of farm equipment, ductile iron pipe, and cement roofing materials. That year Kubota introduced the first small agricultural tractor in Japan.
