   Japan's Daikin Industries acquired the firm in late 2012 from
   <company id="138302">
    Hellman &amp; Friedman
   </company>
   for $3.7 billion. (Daikin was forced to put its bid for Goodman on hold following the devastating 2011 earthquake in Japan.)

   Goodman's distribution centers are located in key states, such as Texas, California, and Pennsylvania, to offer access to large North American markets. Sold under the Goodman, Quietflex, and Amana names, Goodman specializes in HVAC assembling, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and distributing.

  <p>
   In addition to independent distributors, Goodman's customers include contractors who install residential and light commercial HVAC products, national homebuilders, and other national accounts. The company sells to contractors mainly through its distribution network, which accounts for a majority of sales.

  <p>
   Goodman, which offers Daikin a deeper presence in North America, made its parent company the world's largest HVAC manufacturer. The alliance also strengthens Daikin's duct-type air conditioner operations, which perform better in the US market than its own ductless air conditioners.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is looking to expand its distribution network, as well as its light-commercial product line, which has been an area of growth for the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Historically, about a quarter of Goodman's sales have been associated with residential new construction. However, a slowdown in the construction market contributed to a decline in sales to that market. Now, between 15% to 20% of sales are associated with residential new construction. The remainder comes from repair, retrofitting, and replacements.

  <p>
   Goodman Global was founded in 1975 by Harold Goodman to manufacture flexible duct for simplifying the installation of central air conditioning systems. The company entered the air-conditioning equipment distribution business in 1980; two years later it entered the air-conditioning equipment manufacturing business.
