   Swedish gear-jammer Scania is one of the world's largest heavy-truck and bus manufacturers, hauling in sales from more than 100 countries. It derives more than 60% of its sales from Europe; other major markets include Asia and Latin America, especially Brazil, where it holds a 26% market share. The company focuses primarily on producing trucks with gross weights of 16 tons or greater. Scania also makes buses for public transit and tourism, builds industrial and marine engines, and offers maintenance and financing services.

  <p>
   What is now Scania AB began in Sweden in the early 1890s as a bicycle factory owned by English bike maker Humber. The factory was sold to Swedish interests, and the name was changed to Masinfabriks AB Scania. By 1901 the company began to make cars.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1903 Scania made three models: the Model A (four-seater), the Model B (two-seater), and the Model C (a large, luxury car). Scania merged with Vagnfabriks Aktie Bolaget, a railcar maker that had been building cars in Sweden since 1897; the enterprise was named Scania-Vabis.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought Vikmanshytte Bruk (iron ore) and Bruzaholms Bruk (pig iron foundry and workshops) in 1917 to ensure a steady flow of raw materials. The deals were financed, in part, by
   <company id="90885">
    Investor AB
   </company>
   's purchase of newly issued shares, which introduced the company to Sweden's dynastic Wallenberg family. In 1919 the company turned its focus to trucks, and cars were phased out. The strategy turned sour as postwar depression and inflation dried up what little civilian demand existed for trucks.
  </p>
  <p>
   To stay afloat, the company sold products to the Swedish Postal Service, Customs Service, and other institutional and government customers. It also began to produce buses, making 20 in 1923. By 1925 Scania-Vabis was selling 100 trucks per year, and by 1930 it paid off its accumulated losses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Scania-Vabis introduced its first diesel engine in 1936. The company strengthened its technical staff and streamlined its purchasing, planning, and design processes in hopes of starting large-scale production for the civilian market. However, with the onset of WWII, almost all of its contracts were military-related, as it delivered armored personnel carriers, trucks, and tanks to the Swedish armed forces.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1948 Scania-Vabis became
   <company id="41853">
    Volkswagen
   </company>
   's importer for Sweden. Sales did not support an exclusive Scania-Vabis European dealer network, so dealers added Volkswagen and Willys-Overland (jeep) products. Scania-Vabis exported less than 10% of its production in 1949. By 1959 more than half of its sales came from exports.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1960s Scania-Vabis inched into German and French markets. It opened its first plant outside Sweden in São Paulo, Brazil, in 1962. The next year an assembly plant was built in the Netherlands.

    Saab

   acquired Scania-Vabis in 1969. The company was renamed Saab-Scania AB. By the 1970s Saab-Scania had a large market share in nearly every country in Western Europe. The company also focused on gaining a larger share of the American auto market. Saab-Scania's US sales in 1978 had increased from the early part of the decade by 19%.

   paid $600 million in 1989 for 50% of the Saab passenger car business. Fearing a hostile takeover, Peter Wallenberg, Saab-Scania's largest shareholder, took the company private, buying all outstanding shares for $2.3 billion in 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   Saab and Scania were split in 1995 to create Saab AB and Scania AB. The following year Scania was listed on the Stockholm and New York stock exchanges. The next generation of trucks and buses, the 4-series, was launched in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   Investor AB CEO and Scania director Marcus Wallenberg sold nearly 30% of Investor AB's stake in Scania to
   <company id="41854">
    Volvo
   </company>
   in 1999. The following year Volvo proposed to buy the rest of Scania, but the EU Commission blocked the move. Also in 2000 Volkswagen bought a 34% stake in Scania. Later in the year Volkswagen entered talks with Volvo to buy the Swedish truck maker's stake in Scania.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Scania announced that it would restructure its bus and coach activities by creating a stand-alone coach building business and integrating its bus chassis operations with its truck business. The following year Scania sold its 50% stake in joint venture Svenska Volkswagen back to Volkswagen; Svenska Volkswagen sold Volkswagen cars in Sweden.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Dutch army signed a deal in 2003 to purchase more than 550 all-wheel-drive trucks from Beers Bedrijfsauto, one of Scania's wholly owned subsidiaries. Scania and

   inked a deal in 2004 for the Swedish company to supply engines for Deere's agricultural machinery in Brazil.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through its Scania Belgium subsidiary, the company acquired the Universal Auto group of dealerships for an undisclosed amount in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 German truck and heavy manufacturing concern
   <company id="91160">
    MAN
   </company>
   announced it was interested in acquiring Scania in a deal that would create Europe's largest maker of commercial trucks. Scania's board of directors rejected MAN's offer of $12.2 billion. MAN held around 17% of Scania's voting rights. Volkswagen bought a 15% stake in MAN, signaling that it thought such a merger was a good idea, and later increased that stake to almost 30%. MAN later upped its bid for Scania to $13.3 billion, and that offer was also rebuffed.
   <company id="90885">
    Investor AB
   </company>
   , Scania's other leading shareholder, was also resistant to the sweetened offer. The following year MAN withdrew its hostile bid for Scania, but did so with the caveat that it would pursue a friendlier tie-up with its European rival in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
   VW increased its voting stake in Scania in 2008 to nearly 69% by buying shares held by Investor AB. The move was further evidence that VW and MAN were not giving up on a three-way tie-up to create a European trucks powerhouse. Porsche made a takeover offer for Scania in 2009 worth about €2.8 billion. Scania's board recommended that shareholders not accept the Porsche offer.
