  <p>
   Ipiranga is the largest private company in the Brazilian fuel distribution market, with a 21% market share in terms of volume in 2014 and 7,056 service stations. Ipiranga distributes diesel, gasoline, ethanol, NGV, fuel oil, kerosene, ARLA (a liquid agent which reduces nitrogen oxides emissions from heavy vehicle engines), lubricants, and greases. In addition to gas stations, Ipiranga's network has more than 3,000 am/pm convenience stores and Jet Oil franchises.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ipiranga operates 88 storage terminals. There are two types of facilities: primary storage terminals, generally located near the coast and major cities, which are supplied by refineries through pipelines, and secondary storage terminals, which are mainly located inland, and are supplied by primary terminals by railroad or through road transportation for locations not accessible by railroad. Ethanol is supplied to the terminals by road.
  </p>
  <p>
   Like its competitors, Ipiranga purchases all or nearly all oil-derivative fuels from
   <company id="41357">
    PETROBRAS
   </company>
   under a formal supply contract that establishes the volume and the terms for supply.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Distribution of fuels is carried out through an extensive network of primary and secondary storage terminals. The company's primary storage terminals are generally located near refineries and are used as storage terminals for products to be transported either to secondary storage terminals or to large customers and retail carriers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ipiranga has its own fleet of trucks through its transportation company, Tropical, which was responsible for transportation of 28% of the volume of fuels sold by Ipiranga in 2014, with the remaining portion of the transportation provided by third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's clients are public agencies or business consumers. Distribution to large consumers represented 18% of Ipiranga's sales in 2014. Ipiranga directly sold to 5,368 customers in 2014, including state and municipal governments, industries and cargo and passenger transportation fleet owners. Ipiranga also sells diesel, lubricants, fuel oil and kerosene to 266 independent retail carriers that redistribute these products to small and medium-sized companies throughout Brazil. Ipiranga's retail carrier clients consist mostly of companies that have large fixed tanks at their facilities. These clients represented 7% of Ipiranga's sales volume in 2014.

  <p>
   In 2014 Ipiranga's net sales increased by 10% in local currency due to higher sales volumes, an increase in diesel and gasoline refinery prices charged by PETROBRAS, coupled with an increase of ethanol costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales volume of gasoline, ethanol, and natural gas for vehicles increased by 8% as a result of a 6% growth of the light vehicles fleet and investments made in new service stations and in the conversion of unbranded service stations.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's  sales strategy is to increase Ipiranga's market share by converting unbranded stations to Ipiranga's brand and by opening new service stations, focusing on Brazil's Midwest, Northeast, and North, where it has lower market share and where consumption growth is higher than the national average, given the lower car penetration and faster-growing household income in these regions. Ipiranga's strategy also includes expanding its logistics infrastructure to support the growing demand for fuels in Brazil and launching initiatives aimed at differentiating its products and services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ipiranga's Posto Ecoeficiente project (Eco-Efficient service station) offers expertise in the construction and operation of service stations intended to improve the use of resources such as water and electricity and to reduce waste and residues, therefore improving the profitability of these stations and benefiting Ipiranga's resellers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Ipiranga expanded its online service station, Posto Ipiranga na Web (Ipiranga service station on the web, launched in 2011), allowing customers to acquire credits of fuel over the internet and use them at accredited service stations.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Ipiranga launched its own supply service for its am/pm convenience stores, the am/pm Suprimentos.
