        <p>
   Graco is the core operation of the Baby &amp; Parenting business segment. As part of Newell Rubbermaid's work to strengthen this part of its business and extend its reach into international markets, it acquired add-on businesses Aprica, a Japanese manufacturer of strollers, and German stroller maker Teutonia.
  </p>
        <p>
   Along with acquisitions, Graco reaches new customers by launching new products and by investing in consumer-driven research and development. The company in 2013 rolled out the FastAction Fold Jogger Click Connect, its first jogging stroller, and the first-ever Glider family of swings. Previous innovations include the Graco Sweetpeace Newborn Soothing Center, a baby swing that uses patent-pending movements to soothe infants, as well as the Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 car seat, which accommodates babies through children weighing in at 100 lbs. as they transition to a backless booster seat.
  </p>
        <p>
   Graco has also extended its reach into new product niches through licensing deals. The company has been able to expand its products portfolio with the help of LaJobi Industries, a distributor and retailer of baby furniture.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   While Newell Rubbermaid does not break out separate financials for Graco, net sales for its Baby &amp; Parenting segment came in at $736 million in fiscal 2012, representing an 8% increase from $680.4 million in 2011. North American retail sales and sustained growth in the Asia Pacific markets both contributed to a core sales increase of 10%. North American and international sales rose 11% and 9%, respectively, during the reporting period.

        <p>
   Founded as Graco Metal Products in 1942 by Russell Gray and Robert Cone, the firm developed the first wind-up infant swing called the Swyngomatic in 1955. In the 1950s Graco designer David Saint, who has nine children, used to watch his wife soothe crying babies in a backyard swing. One of Saint's sons, Nate Saint, designed Graco's Pack N' Play portable play yards, which debuted in 1987.
