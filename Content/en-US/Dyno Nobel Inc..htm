  <p>
   The company operates under the Explosives segment of parent
   <company id="159618">
    Incitec Pivot
   </company>
   . The segment accounted for about 57% of the parent company's revenues in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   DNA's revenues grew by 3% in 2013 primarily due to increased volume, partially offset by a decline in the Agriculture and Industrial Chemicals business (as a result of decreases in urea and urea ammonium nitrate prices), partially offset by higher volumes from the St. Helena (US) plant.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it experience lower earnings, driven by the negative impact of lower urea and urea ammonium nitrate prices in the Agriculture and Industrial Chemicals business, and a downturn in the coal sector (which reduced ammonium nitrate sales volumes).
  </p>
  <p>
   DNAP's revenues increased by 25% in 2013, primarily due to increased volumes. Its earnings increased due to higher profit from the Moranbah (Australia) plant, and an increase in earnings from DNAP's joint venture business in Moura (Australia), driven by a stronger production performance.

    Orica
   </company>
   for about $3 billion in 2008.

   Formerly based in Norway, Dyno Nobel was founded in 1865 by an associate of Swedish dynamite inventor and prize giver Alfred Nobel.
  </p>
  <p>
   Founder Alfred Nobel changed the world with his invention of dynamite and the detonator in the mid-1800's and changed it again when he founded the world famous Nobel Prizes. Dyno Nobel traces its roots back to William Bickford's invention of Safety Fuse in 1831 and Alfred Nobel's legacy of safety and innovation.
