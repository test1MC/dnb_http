   Offerings by Teledyne Technologies know no boundaries; they are critical to products that work on land, in the air, and under the sea. The company makes a slew of electronic components and subsystems, instruments, and communications equipment for both domestic and foreign commercial customers and US government customers. Its lineup ranges from digital imaging and software to data acquisition and communication tools for aircraft, monitoring and control devices for environmental, marine, and industrial projects, defense electronics, and energy generation, storage, and propulsion equipment.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Teledyne operates through more than 65 principal operating facilities across 18 states and international locations in Canada, the UK, The Netherlands, and Denmark. It generates about 80% of its net sales in the US.

  <p>
   Teledyne divides its operations across four segments: Instrumentation (46% of total sales), Aerospace and Defense Electronics (26%), Digital Imaging (16%), and Engineered Systems (12%).
  </p>
  <p>
   Among its contract wins, Teledyne contributes to the US government's space program. The company has developed software and engineering equipment used in
   <company id="54834">
    NASA
   </company>
   's Space Shuttle program and International Space Station. Teledyne also heavily supports the US military in areas of air, missle, and naval defense. In the private sector, the company designs and manufactures marine instrumentation devices that help to locate oil and gas reserves beneath the ocean floor. Its products also are used to monitor a range of negative environmental conditions, as well as collect digital flight data on airplanes.

  <p>
   The US government, its agencies, and defense and aerospace contractors account for almost 20% of sales. Other customers include airlines, industrial manufacturers, and oil and gas exploration and production companies. The company sells its products through an internal sales force, distributors, and commissioned sales representatives.

  <p>
   After experiencing four straight years of steady growth, Teledyne saw its revenue dip 4% from 2014 to 2015 due to decreases across almost all of its segments. Its profits also decreased by 10% from 2014 to 2015, mainly due to a spike in interest and debt expenses related to recent acquisitions and stock repurchases. In addition, Teledyne's operating cash flow dropped 27% during that same time period.
  </p>
  <p>
   Instrumentation sales dropped 6% in 2015 due to lower sales of marine instrumentation, related to lower sales of geophysical sensors for offshore oil exploration. This segment also experienced lower sales for interconnect systems for land-based energy applications in addition to lower international electronic test and measurement instrumentation sales, due in part to the impact of foreign exchange rates.

  <p>
   Teledyne had previously achieved revenue milestones partly through the help of acquisitions. In early 2015, it acquired Bowtech Products Limited, a designer and manufacturer of harsh underwater environment vision systems. The deal filled a product gap in marine technologies, adding optical underwater cameras to Teledyne's wide range of acoustic imaging and sonar products.

   In late 2014, Teledyne snapped up
   <company id="52393">
    Bolt Technology Corporation
   </company>
   in a deal valued at $171 million. Bolt is a developer and manufacturer of marine seismic data acquisition equipment used for offshore oil and natural gas exploration. It also makes remotely operated robotic vehicles systems used for a variety of underwater tasks.
