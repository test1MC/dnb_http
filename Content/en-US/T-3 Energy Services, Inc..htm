   T-3 Energy Services (T-3) would like to get a chokehold on the oil and gas industry. The
   <company id="14598">
    Robbins &amp; Myers
   </company>
   company manufactures and repairs high-pressure oilfield equipment including valves, chokes, actuators, blow-out preventers, and wellhead equipment. T-3 refurbishes and repairs pumps, electric motors, and generators; manufactures specialty bolts and fasteners; and fabricates equipment used for oil and gas operations. It also distributes pipes, valves, gaskets, and other products. The company serves oil and gas customers in the US and Canada, as well as in Australia, Belgium, Indonesia, and Venezuela.

  <p>
   T-3's reported a 40% increase of its total revenues in fiscal 2012. The increase was primarily due to a boost in customer demand resulting from higher oil prices worldwide in fiscal 2012 and increased expenditure for drilling activity as exploration and production companies invested to capture oil and gas from shale formations in North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its backlog at the end of fiscal year 2012 was $169.7 million, compared with $121.3 million at the end of fiscal year 2011. Following its acquisition by
   <company id="14598">
    Robbins &amp; Myers
   </company>
   , T3- helped to lift the parent company's revenues to record levels in fiscal 2011. The stronger orders for T-3's equipment was due to higher drill rig deployments and later-cycle new rig builds, as exploration companies took advantage of higher oil prices.

  <p>
   In 2011 the company was acquired by Robbins and Myers for approximately $618.4 million, which consisted of $106.3 million in cash, $492.1 million as the fair value of T-3's common shares and $20 million as the fair value of options and warrants issued to replace T-3 grants for pre-merger services and warrants.
  </p>
  <p>
   The purchase dramatically boosted Robbins &amp; Myers' energy operations within its Fluid Management Group, giving it a larger strategic platform to support future growth and international expansion.
