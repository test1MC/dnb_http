   UnitedHealth unites its health plans with consumers across the US. As a leading health insurer, it offers a variety of plans and services to group and individual customers nationwide. Its UnitedHealthcare health benefits segment manages HMO, PPO, and POS plans, as well as Medicare, Medicaid, state-funded, and supplemental vision and dental options. Together, the UnitedHealthcare businesses serve about 40 million members. In addition, UnitedHealth's Optum health services units --
   <company id="104835">
    OptumHealth
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="105550">
    OptumInsight
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="105623">
    OptumRx
   </company>
   -- provide wellness and care management programs, financial services, information technology solutions, and pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services to an additional 115 million.
  </p>

  <p>
   Within the universe of UnitedHealth, UnitedHealthcare is king, with the core health benefits segment accounting for about 65% of annual revenues. The UnitedHealthcare Employer &amp; Individual unit, which serves about 30 million members through its plans for students, families, individuals, and businesses (ranging from sole proprietorships to multinational enterprises), is the largest health benefits business, with the UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement senior services unit not far behind. A smaller division, UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State, manages public Medicaid programs for disabled and disadvantaged citizens. The UnitedHealthcare Military &amp; Veterans provides medical plans for about 3 million active and retired military personnel and their families in the western US through a government TRICARE contract. The UnitedHealthcare Global (formerly UnitedHealthcare International) unit serves international markets and includes
   <company id="105387">
    Amil
   </company>
   , which provides health and dental benefits to some 5 million people in Brazil.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Optum health services division includes OptumHealth, OptumInsight, and OptumRx. OptumHealth is the health and wellness arm serving more than 78 million individuals, while OptumInsight provides technology and consulting services to the health care industry. OptumRx is a pharmacy benefit management (PBM) company that processes hundreds of millions of drug prescriptions annually and manages more billions of dollars' worth of pharmaceutical spending each year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Altogether, the UnitedHealthcare divisions and Optum health service businesses provide benefits and related services to more than 155 million individuals.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   UnitedHealth's plans have a combined provider network of some 1 million doctors and 6,000 hospitals nationwide. Its health plan units and other divisions serve customers throughout the US, as well as 125 international countries.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   UnitedHealth's insurance products are largely sold through independent brokers and consultants, as well as some direct and online sales programs. Optum Rx's network includes more than 67,000 retail pharmacies and a number of home delivery facilities in California and Kansas.

  <p>
   UnitedHealth is not immune to market fluctuations, and as a provider of workplace benefits, UnitedHealth can be particularly vulnerable to massive layoffs occurring during troubled economic times like those that occurred during the Great Recession. Uncertainty over possible changes to federal health reform measures in the US is also a concern for the company. Like many US health insurers, UnitedHealth has worked to insulate itself against economic and market concerns by increasing its commercial premium rates in response to rising medical costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has reported several years of revenue growth and 2015 didn't disappoint with a 20% increase. Revenue rose from $131 billion to $157 billion, driven by acquisitions as well as organic growth within the Optum businesses -- primarily in the OptumRx division related to the acquisition of PBM Catamaran. OptumHealth was given a boost by the acquisitions of patient care centers, while OptumInsight provided more care provider revenue management and payer services. Also contributing to the overall growth in earnings, customer numbers increased across the group and prices increased (reflecting medical cost trends).
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has been slowly rising over the past five years. In 2015 it increased 3% to $6 billion thanks to the higher revenue, but partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Cash flow from operations rose 21% to $9.7 billion that year.

  <p>
   UnitedHealth has prospered to become the largest US health insurer, in part, by expanding into new regions through the purchase of smaller rivals and corporate health plans. It also widens its geographic reach by establishing subsidiaries in new markets, as well as by gaining new government health coverage contracts. For instance, UnitedHealthcare recently became the new administrator for the federal TRICARE West Region health plan, which provides coverage for military personnel in the western US. In 2014 it began offering a Medicare Advantage plan for beneficiaries in the Cincinnati area and northern Kentucky.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has been busily working to introduce new plan options that provide a broader range of coverage. In 2014 it launched UnitedHealthcare Marketplace, a shopping platform for employers seeking to provide a variety of UnitedHealthcare plan options to their employees. It also introduced Baby Blocks, a mobile, interactive incentive program for expectant mothers and new parents enrolled in its employer-sponsored plans to promote prenatal and well-baby care. In 2015 it launched its mobile app Health4Me to Medicaid customers in 17 states.
  </p>
  <p>
   Growth in the diversified health services businesses, which are grouped under the Optum umbrella, have also helped UnitedHealth continue to grow despite economic challenges, especially as the company has been working to expand its wellness and information technology services to meet the growing needs of clients as the US health care landscape undergoes reform measures.
  </p>
  <p>
   For instance, OptumHealth has added personalized wellness, employee assistance, onsite screening, and other services to encourage consumers to actively participate in managing their health and seek preventative care, which helps lower overall medical costs. In addition, the UnitedHealthcare plans are promoting wellness and preventative care by partnering with community organizations (such as the New York and Long Island
   <company id="40536">
    YMCA
   </company>
   groups) and retailers (including
   <company id="10864">
    Kroger
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10049">
    Albertson's
   </company>
   ) to educate consumers on issues such as obesity and diabetes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2015 Optum bought Alere Health, the case management division of
   <company id="104552">
    Alere
   </company>
   , in a $600 million transaction. Alere Health provides condition management, case management, wellness, and women's and children's health services to more than 200 health plans and some 90 large corporations. The deal expanded Optum's scope, adding Alere Health's tobacco cessation, home-based obstetrical services, and other offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   UnitedHealth has also reshaped its OptumInsight business around the booming data management needs of US health providers, primarily in the implementation of electronic health record (EHR) and accountable care organization (ACO) systems, which are reimbursable through new federal health laws. In 2014 Optum launched Optum One, which analyzes patient and claims data to help providers engage patients and coordinate care.

  <p>
   The highly acquisitive company acquired PBM
   <company id="114887">
    Catamaran Corporation
   </company>
   for $12.8 billion in 2015. Catamaran was integrated into the company's
   <company id="105623">
    OptumRx
   </company>
   division. In a deal announced in early 2017, UnitedHealth plans to buy surgical center operator
   <company id="163103">
    Surgical Care Affiliates
   </company>
   for some $2.3 billion. Surgical Care operates more than 200 surgical centers; the unit will join UnitedHealth's
   <company id="104835">
    OptumHealth
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 UnitedHealth acquired MedSynergies, which provides physician practice, physician referral, and revenue management services. It targets physician groups associated with large health systems and serves more than 9,300 care providers throughout the US.

  <p>
   Dr. Paul Ellwood became known as the "Father of the HMO" for his role as an early champion of the health care concept. As a neurology student in the 1950s, Ellwood recognized that applying business principles to medicine could minimize costs and make health care more affordable. Although the HMO was considered a radical approach to health care reform, Ellwood got Congress and the Nixon administration to approve his HMO model in 1970; the next year he hired Richard Burke to put the model into action. Burke established United HealthCare (UHC) in 1974 to manage the not-for-profit Physicians Health Plan of Minnesota (PHP). UHC incorporated in 1977.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought HMOs and began managing others, operating 11 HMOs in 10 states by 1984, the year it went public. Its expansion continued with the purchases of HMOs Share Development (1985) and Peak Health Care (1986). Unfortunately, acquisitions and startups began to eat away at UHC's financial health. Meanwhile, Burke, CEO of both UHC and PHP, was accused by PHP doctors of having a conflict of interest after a change in the HMO's Medicare policy threatened to cut off patients from some member hospitals. Burke resigned in 1987 and was replaced by Kennett Simmons, formerly president of Peak.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year investment firm
   <company id="103796">
    Warburg Pincus
   </company>
   bought nearly 40% of UHC, providing it with much-needed cash. UHC lost nearly $16 million in 1987, largely from a restructuring that axed the company's Phoenix HMO as well as startups in six other markets. The next year UHC sold its share of Peak Health Care.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the late 1980s UHC adopted a new strategy of acquiring specialty companies that provided fee income. It also continued building its HMO network through acquisitions, hoping to gain critical mass in such varied markets as the Midwest and New England.
  </p>
  <p>
   Physician William (Bill) McGuire, another former Peak president, was named UHC's chairman and CEO in 1991. That year PHP and Share merged into Medica.
   <company id="103796">
    Warburg Pincus
   </company>
   distributed its UHC shares to several pension funds and financial institutions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's expansion accelerated in the 1990s with a string of purchases in the Midwest, but there were also divestitures. In 1994 UHC sold subsidiary Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, providing cash for still more purchases, including GenCare (St. Louis), Group Sales and Service of Puerto Rico, and MetraHealth, a former joint venture of
   <company id="16727">
    Travelers Group
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40313">
    Metropolitan Life
   </company>
   . UHC's interest in fee-based businesses continued with the 1997 purchase of Medicode, a major provider of health care information products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the firm planned to buy rival
   <company id="10756">
    Humana
   </company>
   . However, bloated UHC decided it should slim down to prepare to consummate the agreement; when UHC announced that it would charge $900 million in costs against earnings, its plummeting stock price devalued the primary currency of the deal, which quickly collapsed. That year it began offering MediGap and other supplements to AARP members.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company changed its name to UnitedHealth Group in 2000. It also added UK-based contract research organization ClinPharm International to
   <company id="105550">
    Ingenix
   </company>
   that year, and it announced it would let doctors -- not administrators -- choose what treatment patients would get, partially because it was spending more on care scrutiny than the practice saved. Nevertheless, many doctors claimed the process was still restrictive.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the
   <company id="47069">
    American Medical Association
   </company>
   (AMA) and other parties sued the company, claiming it used faulty Ingenix data to reduce payments to member doctors. (UnitedHealth settled the AMA lawsuit in 2009 for $350 million without admitting any wrongdoing, as well as some state lawsuits related to the database.)
  </p>
  <p>
   UnitedHealth's strategy for expansion in the early 21st century concentrated on acquisitions and joint ventures. To expand its Medicaid services business, the firm bought
   <company id="105883">
    AmeriChoice
   </company>
   in 2002. The company also bought
   <company id="11056">
    Mid Atlantic Medical Services
   </company>
   because its HMOs and specialty health care operations complemented UnitedHealth's core operations.
   <company id="99368">
    Golden Rule
   </company>
   was acquired in late 2003 so UnitedHealth could enter the individual health insurance market by providing medical savings accounts. UnitedHealth also bought individual health care reimbursement account provider Definity Health in late 2004 for the same purpose. To increase its market share in the northeastern US, the company bought
   <company id="15344">
    Oxford Health Plans
   </company>
   that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   UnitedHealth spent $8.8 billion to acquire and integrate
   <company id="14364">
    PacifiCare
   </company>
   in 2005. Adding 3 million customers, the acquisition gave UnitedHealth a leading position in the California and West Coast markets, but it also prompted a landslide of complaints from customers alleging mishandled claims. The California Insurance Commissioner and other state agencies sought fines of more than $1 billion. While PacifiCare continued to exist as a health plan brand of UnitedHealth, the PacifiCare administrative operations were integrated into other UnitedHealth units, including UnitedHealthcare. The PacifiCare Prescription Benefits unit became separate operating division of UnitedHealth.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chairman and CEO McGuire became the focus of inquiry in 2006 over a scandal involving the back-dating of stock options awarded to him and other company executives. Following a board inquiry, McGuire was shown the door and was replaced by Stephen Hemsley, formerly the company's president and COO. The back-dating brouhaha continued to be a distraction for UnitedHealth, and in 2008 it opted to settle several related shareholder lawsuits by agreeing to pay more than $900 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Continuing the acquisitive strategy it laid out after the turn of the millennium, the company in 2006 bought
   <company id="10444">
    Deere &amp; Company's
   </company>
   employee health plan as well as Student Resources, the student insurance division of
   <company id="15009">
    HealthMarkets
   </company>
   '
   <company id="109878">
    MEGA Life
   </company>
   subsidiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company changed the name of its supplemental health division from Specialized Care Service to OptumHealth in 2007. As part of the restructuring, a number of other UnitedHealth businesses were merged into OptumHealth, including ACN Group, United Resources Networks, United Behavioral Health, PacifiCare Behavioral Health, Exante Bank, and Exante Financial Services.
  </p>
  <p>
   UnitedHealth completed several large acquisitions in 2008, spending $730 million to purchase
   <company id="13349">
    Fiserv
   </company>
   's health-related businesses, including Fiserv Health (benefits administration for 2 million members), Avidyn Health (care facilitation), Fiserv Health Specialty Solutions (administration), and Innoviant Pharmacy Benefits Management. UnitedHealth also paid $980 million to acquire
   <company id="111254">
    Unison Health Plans
   </company>
   and used it to expand its
   <company id="105883">
    AmeriChoice
   </company>
   unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   UnitedHealth completed its controversial purchase of Nevada insurance provider
   <company id="12325">
    Sierra Health Services
   </company>
   for approximately $2.6 billion in 2008, gaining some 600,000 health plan members in the state and boosting its position in the growing Southwest market. The acquisition took nearly a year to receive approval from the
   <company id="150279">
    Department of Justice
   </company>
   due to competition concerns. Approval was finally gained on the contingency that UnitedHealth sell its Las Vegas Medicare Advantage program, representing some 27,000 customers, to
   <company id="10756">
    Humana
   </company>
   for $185 million. Sierra Health's operating units, including
   <company id="110267">
    Health Plan of Nevada
   </company>
   and Sierra Health and Life, became part the UnitedHealthcare Nevada division following the acquisition.
