   U.S. Sugar sold nearly 27,000 acres of farmland in the Florida Everglades to the State of Florida in October 2010 for $197 million. The deal between the company and the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) transferred ownership of 26,800 acres of farmland to SFWMD and gives the district a 10-year option to buy U.S. Sugar's remaining 153,000 acres.
  </p>
  <p>
   The deal included the sugarcane growing land, sugar mill, refinery, citrus plant, citrus nursery, rock mines, and its railroad, rail cars and all other related equipment. The proposed buyout came at the suggestion of
   <company id="151680">
    Florida Governor, Charlie Crist.
   </company>
   U.S. Sugar will continue to produce sugar on the land for a number of years to fulfill its supply contracts. After that, the company will go out of business.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to U.S. Sugar, the two-step process provides a greater degree of certainty for its businesses and employees, as well as for the surrounding communities since the company will be able to keep its farming and processing operations viable for a definable future.
