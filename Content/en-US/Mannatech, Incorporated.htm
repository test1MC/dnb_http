   Mannatech's nutritional products provide a sales mantra for independent entrepreneurs. The multi-level marketing company develops and sells nutritional supplements. Many of its proprietary products include Ambrotose, a proprietary blend of monosaccharides (simple sugars) that is claimed to promote cell-to-cell communication and support the body's immune system. Its vitamins, weight management products, and skin care items are distributed through a network of more than 245,000 independent salespeople. The company does not maintain its own manufacturing facilities and instead relies upon third-party contract manufacturers. In 2016 Mannatech opened a storefront at its Coppell, Texas, headquarters.

  <p>
   The Texas-based company operates facilities in 10 countries and sells its products in around 24. It has facilities in the US, Canada, Switzerland, Australia, the UK, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, South Africa, and Mexico. The company rings up approximately 45% of its sales in both the North America (US, Canada, and Mexico) and the Asia-Pacific region (Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong).

   Mannatech's supplements, skin care, and weight management products are distributed through a network of approximately 245,000 active independent associates and members who purchase its products and packs. The company depends on its sales network to successfully promote its products to consumers. To attract new independent sales associates and retain existing representatives, the company regularly offers new sales incentives and career plans, as well as new deals on its promoter "starter packs."

   Mannatech reported sales of $177.4 million in 2013, an increase of 2% versus 2012. The modest rise in sales resulted from increased orders processed and reversed five consecutive years of steep decline, during which its sales tumbled from more than $412 million to about $173.5 million. The company also turned a $3.2 million profit in 2013, its first in six years. Cash flow from operations swung from a deficit of $1.2 million in 2012 to an inflow of $8.6 million in 2013, on cash provided by commissions and incentives payable, deferred revenue, and accounts payable.
  </p>
  <p>
   Legal settlements over the company's marketing practices in 2008 and 2009, and the concurrent economic downturn conspired to send sales and profits swooning. Mannatech has also been hit by a decline in new sales associated and the departure of existing ones, resulting in lower product sales.

  <p>
   To grow, Manatech is looking to attract new sales associates (and retain existing ones), enter new markets, and develop new products. Indeed, the company is dependent on two core products (Ambrotose and Advanced Ambrotose) for 40% of its sales. It holds 96 patents on its proprietary products.
  </p>

   Mannatech is focused on developing and launching new products based on its proprietary RFT (real food technology) platform. In 2013, the company launched Uth Advanced Skin Matrix Rejuvenation Creme, an anti-aging product. In 2012 it launched the new nutritional supplement NutriVerus powder. The company is also conducting research studies on the health benefits of its products.

  <p>
   The Texas Attorney General launched investigations into Mannatech's marketing practices beginning in 2005, pressing formal charges in 2007 accusing the company and its executives of illegally marketing its dietary supplements as cures for cancer, Down's syndrome, and other diseases. (The company has since revised its marketing practices.) The company settled the suit in 2009 with an agreement to pay $6 million in restitution and legal costs; co-founder Samuel Caster paid a $1 million civil penalty and stepped down as Chairman (he had resigned as CEO in 2007). Mannatech also settled several related shareholders' suits in 2008.
