   Brittle, broken, battered bones cease to be a problem with Synthes around. The company makes devices, instruments, and implants used for the surgical treatment of bone disease or trauma. It operates through five product groups: Trauma, Spine, Cranio-Maxillofacial, Biomaterials, and (shudder) Power Tools. From the skull to the foot, the company develops, produces, and markets products for the surgical fixation, correction, and regeneration of the skeleton and related soft tissues. It works closely with the AO Foundation, a not-for-profit research organization specializing in osteosynthesis. Synthes is part of

   Synthes is part of its parent's Medical Devices segment, which makes a range of products in the orthopedics, surgical care, specialty surgery, cardiovascular, diagnostics, diabetes, and vision care markets. Its products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals, and retailers and are primarily used by physicians, nurses, hospitals, and clinics.

   In 2014, Synthes' Codman Neuro unit announced the launch of the ENVOY DA XB Distal Access Guiding Catheter and the 7F ENVOY Guiding Catheter for neurovascular procedures in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Another unit, DePuy Synthes Joint Reconstruction, introduced its total knee replacement product ATTUNETM Knee System in 2013; the following year, it added two new technologies for the ATTUNETM system -- the ATTUNE Rotating Platform and the Medialized Anatomic Patella.

   Synthes' success could be due to its specialized development programs, which involve consulting with surgeons worldwide who work with the company's team of product development scientists, engineers, and product managers to identify clinical needs and develop products to address those needs. Synthes also conducts courses to train surgeons in the use of its products, hoping those physicians will then lobby hospitals to include those products in their supply budgets. In addition, a cornerstone of Synthes' growth strategy has been expanding its global sales force into emerging markets. North America has traditionally been Synthes' largest market, followed by Europe, the Asia/Pacific region, and the rest of the world.

  <p>
   One market in which the company has expanded is its geriatric fracture program, which provides an interdisciplinary approach to the care of elderly patients who are susceptible to or have experienced fractures related to fragility of the bones. The company sees a growing market in this area as Baby Boomers begin to experience bone problems related to aging that include loss of bone density, increasing the risk of fractures. As a greater percentage of the US population reaches retirement age, Synthes expects the number of these fractures to increase substantially, creating opportunities for new products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another area of growth is the foot and ankle region. Synthes has seen its competitors gain market share away from it by introducing new products to meet the needs of foot and ankle surgeons in recent years.
