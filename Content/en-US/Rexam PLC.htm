   In mid-2016, Rexam was acquired by rival
   <company id="10165">
    Ball Corporation
   </company>
   for roughly $6.1 billion. The milestone deal created the world's largest maker of food and beverage cans. As part of the hurdles to complete the deal, Ball agreed to sell twelve plants in Europe and two in Brazil. Further, it agreed to shut down Rexam's London headquarters by the end of 2016. The newly created giant is projected to have annual revenues of $15 billion.

  <p>
   William Bowater started out in London in 1881 as a paper wholesaler and newsprint-purchasing agent. By 1905 three of his sons joined him to form W.V. Bowater &amp; Sons. Before WWI the firm began dealing in wastepaper and exporting surplus newspapers to the Far East. In 1914 the company set up a US subsidiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company went public in 1927. In 1938 the company bought interests in Swedish, Norwegian, and Canadian pulp mills. When demand for newsprint in the UK declined during WWII, W.V. Bowater &amp; Sons diversified into paper packaging. In 1947 it became a holding company and changed its name to Bowater Paper.
  </p>
  <p>
   Diversification came with the firm's purchase of Ralli International (commodity trading, 1972) and Gibbs Nathaniel (food importing, 1978). Bowater Paper sold Ralli in 1981. The big split came in 1984 --
   <company id="10229">
    Bowater Incorporated
   </company>
   was spun off to handle North America's newsprint, coated paper, and pulp businesses and Bowater Industries took up the remaining industrial and building products, packaging, and freight services. As part of the deal, Bowater Industries was forever barred from using the Bowater name in the Americas.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1987 Bowater Industries bought Rexham, a US-based maker of paper products and foils for packaging. Bowater Industries also acquired 49% of US building-products maker MiTek. In 1989 Bowater Industries became simply Bowater. The firm doubled its coated-papers business by buying the US's Specialty Coatings Group in 1992. The next year Bowater bought the rest of MiTek. To avoid confusion with Bowater Inc., Bowater changed its name in 1995 to Rexam (named for its North Wales plant in Wrexham and its successful Rexham subsidiary).
