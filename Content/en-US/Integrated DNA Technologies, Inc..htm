   Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) is there when you need some genetic materials in a pinch. The company supplies oligonucleotides (oligos), which are essentially short strands of DNA and RNA, to research and development entities. Oligos are used to develop new drugs, create diagnostic tests for genetic and infectious diseases, and develop agricultural products. IDT makes custom strands using chemical DNA synthesis machines that can create the oligos within a day after the company has received an order. Founded in 1987, IDT has offices in the US, UK, Germany, Australia, Belgium, and Singapore; it distributes to researchers and other customers in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Americas, and the Middle East.

  <p>
   IDT ships about 44,000 oligos a day to more than 82,000 customers. It has research collaborations with

   The company works to increase its manufacturing capability and geographic reach through acquisitions. In 2013 it bolstered its presence in Asia by purchasing the oligonucleotide business of Singapore-based 1st BASE Pte. Ltd. The acquisition allowed IDT to provide locally produced oligos to scientists in the region. In 2014 the company is focused on expanding into Japan.

  <p>
   The company also partners with other biotechnology companies to develop and produce new DNA materials. Recent partners have included Quanta Biosciences, Glycon Pty Ltd., RainDance Technologies, and SGI-DNA.

  <p>
   In 2013 IDT bought Singapore's 1st Base Pte. and began producing oligos for Asia in that facility. The following year it added to its line of molecular biology products by purchasing Integrated DNA Technologies' Surveyor enzyme product line.
