   Baxter International makes a wide variety of medical products. The company is a leading manufacturer of intravenous (IV) fluids and systems; it also makes infusion pumps, pre-filled syringes, biological sealants, and inhaled anesthetics, as well as dialyzers and other products for the treatment of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Baxter's former BioScience division makes protein and plasma therapies to treat hemophilia and immune disorders. In 2015 Baxter split its operations into two companies -- one focused on biopharmaceuticals (
   <company id="163373">
    Baxalta
   </company>
   ) and the other on medical products (Baxter).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Baxter operates in two primary segments -- Hospital Products and Renal. The Hospital Products segment, which accounts for about two-thirds of total revenue, makes IV solutions and administration sets, pre-filled syringes and vials for injectables, IV nutrition products, pre-mixed drugs and drug reconstitution systems, infusion pumps, inhalation anesthetics, and biosurgery instruments. It also provides services related to pharmacy compounding (customized drug preparation) and drug formulation.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Renal segment provides products and services to help treat ESRD, or irreversible kidney failure, and acute kidney injuries. Its portfolio includes therapies for peritoneal dialysis, in-center and home hemodialysis, continuous renal replacement therapy, and other dialysis services.
  </p>
  <p>
   The group's subsidiaries include Baxter Colorado, Baxter World trade, Baxter Corporation, and

   .

  <p>
   Baxter earns 60% of its annual revenues from sales in international markets. The company has about 50 manufacturing locations in about 25 countries, as well as more than 100 distribution centers and sales operations in over 100 countries around the globe. Primary operating regions outside the US include Canada, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia/Pacific regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company maintains 13 manufacturing sites in the US, including three in Puerto Rico. It operates R&amp;D centers around the world, including facilities in Austria, Belgium, China, Germany, Italy, Japan, Sweden, and the US.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company markets its products to hospitals, nursing homes, dialysis centers, medical and research laboratories, and other health care centers, as well as to physicians and patients themselves. Baxter uses a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors and wholesalers. In the US, third parties such as
   <company id="12894">
    Cardinal Health
   </company>
   warehouse and ship much of Baxter's products through their distribution centers.
  </p>

  <p>
   By keeping its operations diverse and nimble, Baxter has generally kept its revenues on the rise. However, as a result of the spin-off of the Baxalta operations in 2015, revenue declined 40% to $10 billion. Net income, which has been fluctuating, also declined that year. It fell 61% to $968 million -- again due to the lower revenue related to the Baxalta separation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations fell 49% to $1.7 billion in 2015 as a result of the reduced net income. A $52 million legal settlement that year and payments related to a debt tender offer that summer also impacted cash flow.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The strategic objectives of Baxter include advancing its core product portfolio (including international expansion into new markets), driving innovation through research and development, growing through collaborations and acquisitions, and establishing public-private partnerships with government agencies (primarily for hemophilia, renal dialysis, and plasma therapies).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company announced in 2014 that it would divide into two separate companies focused on developing biopharmaceuticals (Baxalta) and on life-saving medical products (Baxter). The separation was completed in mid-2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2015, the company invested $911 million towards the production of dialysis and IV solutions. Baxter is also focused on improving its cost structure and manufacturing capabilities,. In 2012 Baxter announced that it would expand capacity of its plasma-based medicines by building a new manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia. The plant is expected to cost more than $1 billion over a period of five years and will open in 2018. In 2014 Baxter announced plans to build an R&amp;D center in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the company received
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval of BAXJECT III, a reconstitution system for ADVATE that reduces the number of steps in the reconstitution process for hemophilia A patients. The system also received approval in Europe, and it was granted approval for ADVATE in Turkey and Russia. Other approvals that year included HYQVIA (treating adult immunodeficiency), OBIZUR (for adult-acquired hemophilia A), RIXUBIS (pediatric hemophilia B), and FLEXBUMIN 5% (human albumin). In 2015 the FDA approved the company's PHOXILLUM Renal Replacement Solutions (BK4/2.5 and B22K4/0) and antibacterial injection Cefazolin.
  </p>
  <p>
   Baxter has launched restructuring programs to offset some problems in recent years, including product recalls and harsh competitive conditions in some markets.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In late 2016, Baxter agreed to buy India-based Claris Injectables from Claris Lifesciences for approximately $625 million. With that purchase, the company will gain capabilities in the production of generic injectable medicines. Baxter will also gain a portfolio of development and marketed injectables, including 11 US-approved molecules. Post-merger, the company expects to launch between seven and nine new products annually.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Idaho surgeon Ralph Falk, his brother Harry, and California physician Donald Baxter formed Don Baxter Intravenous Products in 1931 to distribute the IV solutions Baxter made in Los Angeles. Two years later the company opened its first plant, located outside Chicago. Ralph Falk bought Baxter's interest in 1935 and began R&amp;D efforts leading to the first sterilized vacuum-type blood collection device (1939), which could store blood for weeks instead of hours. Product demand during WWII spurred sales above $1.5 million by 1945.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1949 the company created Travenol Laboratories to make and sell drugs. Baxter went public in 1951 and began an acquisition program the next year. In 1953 failing health caused both Falks to give control to William Graham, a manager since 1945. Under Graham's leadership, Baxter absorbed Wallerstein (1957); Fenwal Labs (1959); Flint, Eaton (1959); and Dayton Flexible Products (1967).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1975 Baxter's headquarters moved to Deerfield, Illinois. In 1978 the company debuted the first portable dialysis machine and had $1 billion in sales. Vernon Loucks Jr. became CEO two years later. Baxter claimed the title of the world's leading hospital supplier in 1985 when it bought American Hospital Supply (a Baxter distributor from 1932 to 1962). Offering more than 120,000 products and an electronic system that connected customers with some 1,500 vendors, Baxter captured nearly 25% of the US hospital supply market in 1988. That year it became Baxter International.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 Baxter spun off Caremark (home infusion therapy and mail-order drugs) but kept a division that controlled 75% of the world's dialysis machine market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 Baxter pleaded guilty (and was temporarily suspended from selling to the Veterans Administration) to bribing Syria to remove Baxter from a blacklist for trading in Israel.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company entered the US cardiovascular perfusion services market in 1995 with the purchases of PSICOR and SETA. Baxter, along with two other silicone breast-implant makers, agreed to settle thousands of claims (at an average of $26,000 each) from women suffering side-effects from the implants. The next year Baxter spun off its cost management and hospital supply business as Allegiance (sold to Cardinal Health in 1999).
  </p>
  <p>
   Buys in 1997 boosted Baxter's presence in Europe and its share of the open-heart-surgery devices market. That year it agreed to pay about 20% of a $670 million legal settlement in a suit relating to hemophiliacs infected with HIV from blood products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In response to concerns posed by shareholders, Baxter in 1999 said it would phase out the use of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) in some products by 2010. In 2000 the firm spun off its underperforming cardiovascular unit as Edwards Lifesciences. To strengthen core operations, it lined up a number of purchases, including North American Vaccine.
  </p>
  <p>
   Purchases in 2001 included the cancer treatment unit of chemicals firm Degussa. Also that year Baxter withdrew dialysis equipment from Spain and Croatia after patients who used its products died. It also ended production of two types of dialyzers that were sold there. As the number of deaths mounted to more than 50 in seven countries, Baxter began facing lawsuits; it later settled with the families of many of the patients. In September 2002 the FDA issued a warning when several patients died after using Baxter's Meridian dialysis machines. The same year Baxter bought
   <company id="51435">
    Fusion Medical
   </company>
   to expand its BioScience unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. took over as chairman and CEO in April 2004. Parkinson succeeded Harry M. Jansen Kraemer, Jr. William Graham, who remained on the Baxter board of directors as honorary chairman emeritus after his official retirement in 1996, died in 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the FDA seized Baxter's existing inventories of previously recalled 6,000 Colleague Volumetric Infusion Pumps and nearly 1,000 Syndeo PCA Syringe Pumps; the federal agency resorted to these measures after the company did not fix production and design problems with the pumps in a suitable amount of time after batches of the product had been recalled earlier that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Baxter's product troubles didn't end there. In 2008 Baxter halted production of heparin after hundreds of bad reactions (including several deaths) occurred in patients using the drug. Subsequent investigations focused on raw heparin supplied to Baxter by a Chinese factory, which apparently added a cheaper ingredient into the drug which contaminated it. Heparin-related litigation continued for Baxter in following years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the company acquired the hemofiltration (renal replacement therapy) product line of
   <company id="100589">
    Edwards Lifesciences
   </company>
   in a $65 million deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   To meet increasing demand, Baxter also expanded its infusion systems portfolio that year by entering an agreement to distribute medical device maker SIGMA's Spectrum large volume infusion pumps domestically and internationally. The deal also gave Baxter a 40% stake in the company (with the option to buy the rest) as well as access to future products under development. In 2012 Baxter exercised its right to buy and paid $90 million in cash for the remaining 60% of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The addition of the Spectrum system was especially helpful when the FDA ordered the company to recall all of its Colleague infusion pumps in the US market in 2010. Patients were given the option of receiving Spectrum pumps to replace the Colleague systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of restructuring efforts, in 2010 the company sold its noncore US generic injectables business to
   <company id="147742">
    Hikma Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   for about $112 million. Baxter divested the business to focus on its proprietary injectable formulation and packaging operations. The sale also included Baxter's manufacturing facility in New Jersey and a warehouse and distribution center in Tennessee.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company grew its BioScience operations in 2010 by acquiring all of the hemophilia-related assets from privately-held
   <company id="109413">
    Archemix
   </company>
   in a deal worth up to $315 million. Archemix has products under development including a synthetic hemophilia treatment to improve the body's blood clotting capabilities. Then, to jump into the bone grafting market, the company spent some $330 million to acquire UK-based
   <company id="135318">
    ApaTech
   </company>
   , which sells bone grafting materials in the US and Europe; the deal gave Baxter manufacturing and research facilities in Germany, the UK, and the US.
