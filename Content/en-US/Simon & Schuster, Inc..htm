  <p>
   Simon &amp; Schuster was founded in 1924 by Richard L. Simon and M. Lincoln Schuster.

  <p>
   Richard Simon and Max Schuster founded the company in 1924, selling more than 100,000 copies of a crossword puzzle book. The firm's first success outside puzzle books was Will Durant's
   <i>
    The Story of Philosophy
   </i>
   in 1926. Over the next few decades Simon &amp; Schuster published a range of best-selling books (mainly under its Pocket Books division launched in 1939), from authors such as Pearl Buck and Ernest Hemingway. Ownership passed to a company owned by tycoon Marshall Field in 1944 and then back to the publisher's principals in 1957. The company was bought by Gulf + Western Industries (later Paramount Communications) in 1975. Acquisitions in the 1980s included textbook publisher Prentice Hall.
  </p>
  <p>
   Viacom acquired Paramount in 1994, and Jonathan Newcomb replaced Dick Snyder, the hard-charging chairman and CEO widely credited with making the publisher a powerhouse. Four years later Viacom sold Simon &amp; Schuster's reference and educational divisions to Pearson for $4.6 billion and shifted its focus to consumer books. In 2000 the company became the first major publisher to offer a book online. The company launched an e-bookstore selling electronic books for download at its SimonSaysShop.com site in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   Newcomb left the company in 2002 to work at an investment firm, and president and COO Jack Romanos took over as CEO. That year parent Viacom integrated Simon &amp; Schuster into its Viacom Entertainment Group unit. The company also acquired Distican, its Canadian distributor of books and audio products, in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Viacom underwent a reorganization in late 2005, the company became part of the CBS Corporation unit. The following year Simon &amp; Schuster expanded through purchasing and/or launching new imprints, including Howard Books, a religious publishing company; Threshold Editions, for conservative readers; a Hispanic/Latino line within Atria;  African-American publishing line Strebor Books; and Simon Scribbles, a children's coloring and activity imprint.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Romanos announced plans to retire; Carolyn Reidy, former president of the Simon &amp; Schuster Adult Publishing unit, was named his replacement. The company launched a new, redesigned SimonandSchuster.com in 2009.
