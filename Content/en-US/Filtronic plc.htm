   Filtronic designs and manufactures custom-made radio frequency, microwave, and millimeter microwave electronics components and subsystems mainly for the wireless telecommunications industry. Its Filtronic Wireless segment provides equipment to both operators and manufacturers in the mobile telecommunications and its Filtronic Broadband segment provides wireless backhaul components to manufacturers. Its lineup of products are integrated with radios that serve as the backhaul links of telecommunications networks, especially mobile base stations. Filtronic's generation product, Orpheus, was designed for customers to develop small, light outdoor radios for cell towers. About 98% of sales are outside the UK.
  </p>

  <p>
   The Filtronic Wireless business designs and makes RF filters, combiners, TMAs, microwave subsystems and antennas for the mobile telecommunications industry. It generates two-thirds of the company's revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Filtronic Broadband makes 60 to 90GHz millimetre-wave products for mobile broadband backhaul and defense applications and provides build-to-print manufacturing. It accounts for 34% of revenue.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Filtronic's biggest geographic markets are Europe (41% of sales) and the Americas (30% of sales). The UK supplies 2% with the other 27% coming the rest of its markets.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Filtronic's customers are network operators and large original equiupment manufacturers. About three-quarters of its revenue comes from four customers.

  <p>
   Filtronic revenue of £13.6 million in 2016 (ended May), a 23% drop from 2015. The company blamed longer-than-expected adoption of new products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company posted a £5 million loss in 2016, which was less than its 2015 loss.

  <p>
   Filtronic has launched new products including Orpheus and provided contract product development, manufacturing and test services to a range of clients. A 2016 development was a contract to develop long range (20km) E-band communication modules for a US technology company.
  </p>
  <p>
   As new products ramp up, the company obtained new financing and restructured to bring cost into alignment with resources.

  <p>
   David Rhodes, a
   <company id="133499">
    Leeds University
   </company>
   professor of electrical engineering who worked on the US space program (including the first moon landing), founded Filtronic in 1977. The company originally produced signal processing products for customers that included the US military.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the waning of US military spending, Filtronic began to commercialize its components through Filtronic Comtek, established in the UK in 1992 and in the US in 1993, to meet a growing demand for wireless network infrastructure gear. Prior to its public offering the next year, the company split off its Filtronic Components operation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Filtronic Comtek won customers such as
   <company id="10103">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="11023">
    Motorola
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41820">
    Nokia
   </company>
   . In 1995 the company decided to triple its manufacturing capacity and established a subsidiary in Australia. Soaring telecommunications industry sales sent Filtronic Comtek on an acquisition spree. It reacquired Filtronic Components and sister firm Filtronic Cable in 1998. The combined operation was named Filtronic plc. It also bought rival microwave products maker Sage Laboratories, Finnish mobile phone headset maker LK Products (from Nokia), and Litton's Solid State Subsystems unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year chairman and CEO Rhodes came across an inactive semiconductor plant owned by Fujitsu while vacationing in the UK. Filtronic bought the facility and formed Filtronic Compound Semiconductors (FCS) to manufacture chips based on gallium arsenide, an alternative to silicon. (FCS was sold in 2008 to
   <company id="53141">
    RF Micro Devices
   </company>
   .) Also in 1999 the company established a subsidiary in China to provide cellular equipment to the region. Late that year Christopher Snowden, Filtronic's director of technology and former head of electrical engineering at Leeds University, joined Rhodes as joint CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company boosted its US presence with the 2000 purchase of digital signal processing software maker Sigtek. In 2001 Filtronic expanded its wireless operations in China and signed agreements with
   <company id="11516">
    Tyco International
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40681">
    BAE SYSTEMS
   </company>
   to provide them with semiconductors. The company also scaled back its US operations when AT&amp;T opted to use different technology to expand its wireless network.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004, veteran engineer and
   <company id="133537">
    University of Edinburgh
   </company>
   professor John Roulston joined the company as CEO; Rhodes remained chairman. The next year, Christopher Snowden left Filtronic to become chief executive of Surrey University.
  </p>
  <p>
   Citing poor market conditions, the company called off plans for an IPO of its LK Products subsidiary, which made phone handset antennas. In 2005 Filtronic sold LK for more than $80 million to US-based
   <company id="12371">
    Technitrol
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2006, Roulston left the company, and Rhodes reassumed CEO duties. Rhodes retired later that year. He was succeeded by Charles Hindson, Filtronic's finance director and a former financial executive of
   <company id="92012">
    Eutelsat
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company sold its filter-based transmit/receive module and power amplifier businesses to
   <company id="52483">
    Powerwave Technologies
   </company>
   for $185 million in cash and 17.7 million shares of Powerwave common stock. The transaction represented the majority of Filtronic's Wireless Infrastructure business; it did not include the company's point-to-point radio backhaul equipment, compound semiconductors, and defense electronics businesses. Filtronic received an equity stake of around 11% in Powerwave.
  </p>
  <p>
   Filtronic later sold its Powerwave shares, realizing net proceeds of more than £53 million ($107 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   Responding to weakening economic activity in 2007 and 2008, the company shifted its concentration to its Point to Point business. Filtronic's shift has included reorganization -- a top to bottom overhaul of operations. In 2008 it sold its Filtronic Compound Semiconductors Limited subsidiary to US-based
   <company id="53141">
    RF Micro Devices
   </company>
   for about $25 million. The deal included gallium arsenide device development and production in Aycliffe, England -- formerly Europe's #1 compound-semiconductor fab.
  </p>
  <p>
   Filtronic passed its US Defense Electronics business on to Teledyne Limited, a subsidiary of
   <company id="61246">
    Teledyne Technologies
   </company>
   , in 2007 for about $24 million. Winding up, Filtronic looks to exit its remaining defense business as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   Majority shareholders guided the sale of the company's wireless infrastructure business in 2006 to US
   <company id="52483">
    Powerwave Technologies
   </company>
   , and subsequent restructuring. Filtronic cut its workforce, too, more than 25% during 2008 and 2009.
