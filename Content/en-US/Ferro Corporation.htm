  <p>
   (The company's revenues has been restated due to the divestiture of its pharmaceuticals business, Ferro Pfanstiehl Laboratories). In 2013 Ferro's revenues actually decreased by 8% to $1.6 billion due to decreased sales of Pigments, Powders, and Oxides, primarily due to the exit of its solar pastes business in 2013, and decreased sales in Polymer Additives as the result of changing environmental regulations. Partially mitigating these decreases were increased revenues from the Performance Colors and Glass and Performance Coatings segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   After experiencing a net loss in 2012 due to increased income tax expenses, in 2013 Ferro reported net income of $71.9 million as the result of  lower income tax expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash inflow decreased to $18.5 million in 2013 compared to $23.7 million in fiscal 2012 due to higher net income offset by noncash adjustments from impairment charges in the prior year as well as cash payments for restructuring activities in 2013 ($18.3 million, compared to $3.4 million in 2012).

It is also selling non core businesses and streamlining many of its management information systems worldwide to improve business processes.

   In 2013 the company sold its precious metals-based powders and flakes product lines in North America and Asia to Ames Advanced Materials Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ames Goldsmith Corporation, a major producer of precious metal products.it also sold its pharmaceuticals business, Pfanstiehl Laboratories, to PLI Holdings, Inc., an affiliate of Med Opportunity Partners, LLC. The Ferro portfolio now is more fully concentrated on its core technologies in coatings and color and glass science, polymer science, and organic synthesis.

   That year Ferro announced that it will add significantly to its plasticizer product offerings by installing new dibenzoates production capability at its operations in Antwerp, Belgium. The Antwerp project will provide annual production capacity of 28,000 metric tons of dibenzoates, a non-phthalate, fast-fusing plasticizer. The company expects to significantly strengthen its market position through this project, offering high-performance plasticizers for a broad range of markets and applications to customers preferring a non-phthalate solution.
