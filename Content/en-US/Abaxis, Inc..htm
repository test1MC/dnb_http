   Abaxis makes a praxis of analyzing blood. Its two types of point-of-care blood analyzers (one for animals and one for humans) can each perform more than a dozen tests on their respective veterinary and human health patients. The analyzers are portable, require little training, provide on-the-spot results, and offer built-in quality control and calibration. Abaxis also sells compatible chemical reagent supplies. In the veterinary market, its systems bear the VetScan name; in the human medical market, Piccolo Xpress. Abaxis sells to veterinarians, hospitals, managed care organizations, and the military.

  <p>
   The company's veterinary segment accounts for about three-fourths of revenues. Abaxis sells its chemistry blood analysis systems to vets and doctors, and then generates additional income from the same customers by supplying consumable supplies for the systems. These supplies, which account for about 80% of annual revenues, primarily consist of single-use reagent disks that allow for automated testing of several conditions at once.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's vet division also sells a handheld testing instrument, as well as hematology instruments for blood clot detection. Abaxis Veterinary Reference Laboratories (AVRL) operates a reference lab facility in Olathe, Kansas, that provides routine and specialty testing services to vets across the US.

  <p>
   Abaxis' products are sold in about 30 countries worldwide. The US accounts for 79% of revenue.

  <p>
   A direct sales force markets the company's veterinary products in North America, where the company conducts more than 80% of its business. Products are then delivered to end-users by third-party distributors including
   <company id="130291">
    Animal Health International
   </company>
   , which accounts for 15% of Abaxis' annual revenues. Other distributors include Merritt Veterinary Supplies and
   <company id="138212">
    MWI Veterinary Supply
   </company>
   . Outside the US, Abaxis' products are sold through direct sales units (including Abaxis Europe) and through independent representatives and distributors for sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's medical (human) products are distributed in the US through an exclusive contract with
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Labs
   </company>
   , which began in 2013.

  <p>
   Revenues, which had been climbing steadily for years, peaked in 2013 at $186 million then took a spill in 2014, dropping 8% to $182 million as Abbott Labs paid lower prices for its human analyzers and instruments, and sales softened for vet products. Net income tagged along, losing 48%, from $27.5 million to $14.2 million. Cash from operations, however, has been growing since 2012 and posted a $6 million increase from 2013 to 2014.

  <p>
   The company regularly introduces new and next-generation versions of its veterinary blood analyzers, instruments, and testing reagents to keep pace with customer demand for innovative and easy-to-use products. For instance in 2011 Abaxis introduced new VetScan rapid canine tests for heartworm, Lyme disease, and parvovirus, and in 2012 it launched a feline rapid heartworm test and a kidney disease test for multiple species of animals. The company is also working to expand its foothold in the human diagnostics market.

  <p>
   In 2013 the company signed an exclusive contract for Abbott Labs to distribute its medical products in the US. The deal originally included China as well but Abaxis took back that region early on.
