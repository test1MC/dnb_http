   The jewels in the crown of Crown Equipment are electric-powered forklift trucks used for maneuvering goods inside warehouses and distribution centers. Among the industry's largest OEMs, the company manufactures a variety of narrow-aisle stacking equipment and hand pallet trucks. Its lift truck equipment can move 4-ton loads and stack pallets nearly 45 ft. high. Crown sells its products globally through dealers and distributors. The company has evolved from making temperature controls for coal furnaces to building 85% of the parts for its material-handling equipment. The Dicke family controls Crown.

   The company operates 15 plants worldwide, including 11 in the US and others in Australia, China, Germany, and Mexico. It additionally owns or runs more than 500 dealer locations in 84 countries in North America, South America (Brazil), Europe, and Asia/Pacific.

   Crown manufactures gas and electric lift trucks. It designs and manufactures 85% of its lift truck components, including key parts like motors, drive units, and electronic modules. Through its SureSpec system, Crown can offer much more than a one-size-fits-all lift. SureSpec allows customers the opportunity to customize a material loader to its needs and specifications. Because the company makes the majority of its equipment parts, such as motors, drive units, and electronic modules, it has better control over the customization process than other companies relying on third-party providers. Continuing on the supply side, Crown is purchasing some parts from China. It also has a manufacturing plant for hand pallet trucks there, and plans on increasing its introduction of new products as well as sales and service outlets.

   The company is expanding its presence in Europe. In 2014 Crown opened of a branch office in Barcelona and a manufacturing office in Germany. In 2013 it relocated its European headquarters from Munich to a nearby location in Feldkirchen, expanded of its Roding facility, and opened a new parts and service center in Pliening, near Munich.

   Crown also grows through innovation. In 2014 the company introduced the Crown PTH 50S Model scissor lift hand pallet truck designed for applications using skids and open-bottom containers. In 2013 it introduced the Crown ST 3000-25 Series walkie straddle stacker capable of handling up to 2,500 pounds and working in environments with tight spaces, such as grocery and retail.

   Under the leadership of its founders' third generation, the company aims to maintain its competitive presence by expanding its own parts manufacturing capacity and expertise. The effort strengthens Crown's quality control efforts, as well as enables some pricing advantages. It also fuels faster product development by allowing in-house oversight of prototype projects. As a result, Crown's portfolio has grown. During recent years the company introduced its Hamech brand of internal combustion forklifts (using liquefied petroleum gas, gas, and diesel) for heavy-duty jobs, representing its first step into the industrial market. Crown's technology research and development (R&amp;D) also extends to fuel-cell powered lift trucks, which are in prototype stages. The related R&amp;D for this segment is supported by the company's Fuel Cell Research Center in Ohio.
