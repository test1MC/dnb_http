   Why did the chicken cross the road? Answer: To become part of the portfolio of poultry products offered by Farmer's Pride. Doing business as Bell &amp; Evans, the company produces fresh, organic chicken and a variety of ready-to-cook and fully-cooked entrees and snacks. Bell birds, touted as healthier fare, are raised sans antibiotics or growth hormones, and fed hexane-free soybean meal. Farmer's Pride also offers Cornish game hen, duck, and roaster chicken.

   Farmer's Pride has gained attention for its poultry raising practices, as well as for its humane slaughter system. The company's system, Angila Autoflow, is designed to take the birds into a chamber where carbon dioxide gas is slowly released, leaving the bird unconscious. It is cited as less stressful for the animals. A significant investment, conversion to the new technology cost roughly $3 million. Farmer's Pride processes about 840,000 birds a week.

   To keep customers coming back, Farmer's Pride in 2012 launched a new line of prepared organic products that includes chicken franks and individually quick frozen (IQF) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut wings, and drumsticks.
