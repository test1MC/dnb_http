   TransAct Technologies knows how to ink the deal. The company makes thermal, inkjet, and impact printers under the Epic, EPICENTRAL, and other brands, that record transaction information for point-of-sale (POS), casino and gaming, lottery, banking, food safety, and e-commerce transactions. TransAct's printers and terminals produce receipts, coupons, lottery tickets, and other printed records. TransAct also makes document transport mechanisms for ATMs and kiosks and manufactures custom printers for electronics manufacturers and oil and gas exploration companies. TransAct sells its products to OEMs, VARs, and other distributors, as well as directly to end-users. About 75% of sales comes from customers in the US.

  <p>
   Connecticut-based TransAct Technologies rings up more than three-quarters of its sales in the US. The company distributes its specialized printers, terminals, and other products in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Africa, Australia, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific. It has engineering, design, assembly, and sales offices, and services centers in Nevada, Texas, California, Georgia, and New York. It also maintains sales and service centers in the UK and China.

   Lottery systems operator
   <company id="15682">
    GTECH
   </company>
   is TransAct's largest customer, representing more than 10% of annual sales. (TransAct has a long-term sales agreement with GTECH, which buys nearly all of its lottery terminals from the company.)
  </p>
  <p>
   TransAct distributes its printers and terminals through original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), value-added resellers, selected distributors, and directly to customers. It also operates an online store, and employs a direct selling team. Advertising expenses, including consulting and professional services, tradeshows, and print ads, totaled $1.06 million in 2013 versus $0.95 million in 2012.

  <p>
   TransAct's 2013 sales fell 12% versus 2012, to $60.1 million, on lower printer and terminals sales due to declines in the lottery, casino and gaming markets, partially offset by higher prices on its Ithaca brand food safety terminals. Net income increased 36% over the same period to $4.9 million on lower costs. Also contributing to the negative sales comparison in 2013 versus 2012 was a large order placed by GTECH (the company's largest customer) in 2012 that wasn't repeated in 2013. A bright spot for the company in 2013 was continued sales growth of POS printers to fast-food giant

    McDonald's Corp
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   International sales declined by 25% in 2013 versus 2012, primarily driven by lower sales in both the international casino and gaming and lottery markets. Together, casino and gaming, and lottery product sales account for more than half of TransAct's annual sales.

   TransAct is focusing of developing new hardware and software, including line extensions, and increasing its market penetration in the US and abroad. It's also looking to lower product costs by sourcing certain products overseas. Going forward, TransAct plans to pursue more business from global restaurant chain operator

    McDonald's
   </company>
   for its Ithaca 9000 and 9700 food safety terminals.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2012, TransAct announced the integration of its Epic 950 printer and EPICENTRAL Print System into Leap Forward Gaming's SaffariNet wireless system. The integrated technology provides a wireless connection between slot machines and printers that can create coupons and other offers.

  <p>
   In August 2011, TransAct acquired Printrex, Inc., a maker of specialty printers primarily sold into the oil and gas exploration, medical, and mobile markets, for $4 million. Printrex, which serves customers in North America, Europe, and Asia, was acquired to complement TransAct's existing product suite.
