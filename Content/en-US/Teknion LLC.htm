   Teknion's strategy for growth relies on the successfully debut its latest advancements to prospective clients through design expositions and conferences for commercial interiors. In preparation for North America's largest show, NeoCon, the parent promoted its sustainable corporate position by renovating its Chicago showroom in mid-2012 in compliance with LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) standards. Teknion's Washington, D.C. showroom received the coveted green-build certification earlier in the year.

   A number of new product successes also depend upon industry trends captured in Teknion's Workplace of the Future survey. Among the survey findings, the company determined that more than 75% of all companies that are increasing utilization of their space intend on implementing collaborative workspaces coupled with fewer offices. The survey's results spurred Teknion to form a North Carolina-based group in spring 2012 to develop and make collaborative office furniture products. It also in 2012 opened a new 7,300 sq. ft. showroom in Atlanta Station, the largest urban redevelopment project in North America and home to Atlanta's top design firms. In 2013 it launched a new 22,000 sq. ft. New York City showroom in order to showcase new lines of products.
