   Tyco ties together its two top territories of fire protection and security. The company provides security products such as access control systems, asset tracking products (using GPS or RFID technology), burglar alarms, fire detection and panic devices, and alarm and control monitoring equipment. In addition,
   <company id="110608">
    SimplexGrinnell
   </company>
   provides fire alarm, sprinklers, and fire extinguishers to clients in Europe. The company's products protect homes, banks, and retail stores, among others. Tyco International serves customers in 50 countries through about 900 locations. In early 2016, Tyco agreed to be purchased by

    Johnson Controls
   </company>
   for $16.5 billion.

   <company id="10825">
    Johnson Controls
   </company>
   is buying Tyco for $16.5 billion in a transaction that will create a home-products juggernaut with a combined $32 billion in revenue. Once the deal is finished, Johnson Controls plans to transition its global headquarters to Tyco's home base in Ireland in order to save on taxes.

   Tyco has been getting its balance sheet in order after a flurry of divestitures. On the heels of selling its former unit,

    Tyco Flow Control
   </company>
   , to
   <company id="14396">
    Pentair
   </company>
   in late 2012, Tyco saw its revenues drop significantly from $17 billion in 2011 to around $10 billion in 2012. Revenues have hovered around the $10 billion mark since, as the company restated its financials for 2012 and 2013 due to the discontinued operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tyco's profits skyrocketed nearly 240% from $536 million in 2013 to $1.8 billion in 2014 primarily due to a major decrease in separation costs and a drop in restructuring and asset impairment charges for 2014.

  <p>
   Tyco grows its core protection and security business through select acquisitions. In late 2014 it announced it was acquiring Industrial Safety Technologies, a maker of gas a flame detection gear, for nearly $330 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2013, Tyco obtained Westfire, a fire protection services company with operations in the US, Chile, and Peru. Westfire was acquired for around $53 million, and it was integrated with Tyco's NA Installation &amp; Services and ROW Installation &amp; Services segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2013, Tyco picked up Exacq Technologies, a developer of open architecture video systems, for $150 million in cash. The deal strengthened Tyco's position in the video security market and extended its video equipment portfolio.

   Arthur Rosenberg founded Tyco, Inc., in 1960 to conduct experimental research for the government and commercial sectors. It successfully developed the Dynalux battery charger, the first blue-light laser, and the first laser with a nonstop beam. Under a new name, Tyco Laboratories (changed in 1965), the firm boosted sales through acquisitions in the mid-1960s to reach $41 million by 1969, up from $1 million in 1963. Rosenberg left Tyco Labs in 1970. Decades later, in 1993, Tyco replaced "Laboratories" with "International" in its name to reflect its multinational operations.
