   Edwards Lifesciences has its heart in the right place. Named for the co-inventor of the first artificial heart valve, Miles "Lowell" Edwards, its main products are still heart valve devices, including valves made from animal tissue, annuloplasty rings that repair damaged valves, and transcatheter heart valves for minimally invasive procedures. The company also makes monitoring systems that measure heart function during surgery; embolectomy catheters that remove blood clots from peripheral arteries; and various types of cannulae (surgical tubes used for drainage, delivery, or filtration) and other surgical supplies. Edwards Lifesciences markets its products worldwide.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Edwards Lifesciences' products fall into three main categories. Its surgical heart valve therapy segment makes tissue valve and valve repair items and accounts for about 35% of sales. The division also offers various items used in minimally invasive surgeries; cannulae and embolectomy catheters used to treat peripheral vascular disease; and disposable items used in cardiac and other major surgeries. The segment's core product line is the Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT pericardial valves, including the line of Magna Ease valves for aortic and mitral surgical replacement.
  </p>
  <p>
   The critical care products segment includes patient monitoring systems, such as the EV1000 for hemodynamic monitoring (cardiovascular performance, heart pressure, and oxygen saturation) using integrated sensors and catheters during and after surgeries. Other critical care offerings include disposable pressure transducers and various catheters (including central venous, pulmonary artery, and balloon). The rapidly growing transcatheter heart valve segment makes catheter-based treatment systems for heart valve disease that negate the need for open-heart surgery. As of 2015, the company's transcatheter aortic heart valves were available for sale in more than 65 countries. The critical care and transcatheter divisions account for some 20% and 50% of sales, respectively.

  <p>
   Edwards Lifesciences sells its products in roughly 100 countries worldwide, with key operations in Australia, Canada, China, Japan, the US, and numerous countries in Europe (including France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK). The company makes most of its sales in the US (50%), Europe, and Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   US manufacturing plants are located in the in Irvine, California; and Draper, Utah; the company also has plants in the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Singapore, and Switzerland. Research labs are located in Israel, the Netherlands, and the US.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Edwards Lifesciences markets its products around the globe through a direct sales force and independent distributors. The company's clients include doctors, nurses, and other hospital or medical facility staff members (such as purchasing managers and administrators).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is a supplier for hospital group purchasing organizations (GPOs).

  <p>
   Despite challenges in the medical device market due to regulatory and economic factors, Edwards Lifesciences has managed to steadily increase revenues over the years by providing innovative products that are essential to modern cardiovascular procedures. (Such products are typically not subject to negative spending or coverage decisions by consumers or insurers.) Revenues increased 7% in 2015 to some $2.5 billion, largely due to an increase in the US market (in which sales grew by 21%). Transcatheter heart valve sales rose 25% -- driven primarily by sales of the Edwards SAPIEN valve and approval of the SAPIEN 3 valve in the US.Even though sales of the Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcetheter valve rose in Europe, overall European earnings declined due to currency exchange rates. Additionally, the critical care and surgical heart valve therapy segments each declined 5% in 2015, again due to currency exchange rates.
  </p>
  <p>
   After seeing steady growth, net income fell 39% to $494 million in 2015. This was largely due to $7 million in intellectual property expenses to settle litigation with
   <company id="10981">
    Medtronic
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations has followed net income over the past five years. In 2015, it fell 46% to $550 million due to the firm's lower net income.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Much of the firm's growth can be attributed to a key aspect of its business strategy: The development of new and next-generation medical devices. Over the past few years Edwards Lifesciences has increased its R&amp;D spending. The company invested $383 million (or about 15% of net sales) in R&amp;D during 2015, up from $347 million in 2014, with a special focus on the high-growth field of minimally-invasive devices, which aim to treat and monitor patients in a less traumatic way.
  </p>
  <p>
   Edwards Lifesciences is focused on the development of next-generation transcatheter heart valves (designed to provide less invasive surgical options). In 2014 the company received US approval for its SAPIEN XT valve (for the treatment of high-risk patients suffering from symptomatic aortic stenosis), and in 2015, it received US approval for its SAPIEN 3 valves. The company is developing additional transcatheter systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, Edwards Lifesciences received
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval to expand the indications for its Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter valve for pulmonic valve replacement procedures. It received similar expanded approval of the Edwards SAPIEN 3 valve.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also creating new versions of its core Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT pericardial tissue valves for aortic and mitrial valve replacement.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the critical care segment, Edwards Lifesciences is focused on the development of new hemodynamic monitoring systems. The firm is also developing minimally invasive automated glucose monitoring systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alongside its growth measures, the company has also been known to downsize product segments that have been slow to grow.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Edwards Lifesciences signed an agreement with Medtronic to settle all outstanding patent litigation between the two companies, including litigation related to transcatheter heart valves.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Acquisitions can serve as an effective way for the company to feed its development pipeline and expand its product offerings. In late 2014, Edward Lifesciences led a group that invested $50 million in CardioKinetix, developer of the Parachute ventricular partitioning device. The investment will help CardioKinetix as it works to bring the device to the US and international markets; it also gives Edwards Lifesciences the right to purchase CardioKinetix at a later date.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company acquired California-based CardiAQ Valve Technologies for $350 million. That deal strengthened its efforts in the treatment of mitral valve patients.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2017 Edwards Lifesciences bought device development firm Valtech Cardio for $340 million plus potential milestone payments of up to $350 million. That purchase included Valtech's Cardioband Reconstruction System for repair of the mitral and tricuspid valves.

  <p>
   Edwards Lifesciences' roots can be traced back to about 1960 when the invention of the artificial heart helped spawn a company that was then called Edwards Laboratories. The company was spun off from former parent

   </company>
   in 2000.
