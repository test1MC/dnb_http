   SARIA Ltd (formerly Prosper De Mulder) dominates in an industry no one likes to think about. As the largest rendering company in the UK, it collects waste and by-products from slaughter houses. SARIA processes the waste to extract fats and meat-and-bone-meal and sells the fats to the likes of soap and chemical manufacturers. Because meat-and-bone-meal material is now heavily regulated due to concerns over the spread of
   <em>
    Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)
   </em>
   or mad cow disease, the company has been turning to renewable energy to diversify its business. Originally founded in 1926 as Prosper De Mulder, the company is owned by Saria Group.

        <p>
   SARIA owns a diverse mix of companies that manufacture products for use in human and animal foodstuffs, agriculture, aquaculture, and industrial products. Additionally, the company provides services for the farming and food industry, and produces biofuel and other renewable energy. As of 2015, the SARIA Ltd employed more than 1,000 people and generated annual turnover (revenue) of roughly £250 million (around $392 million) in the UK.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's renewable energy operations include its SecAnim business unit, which uses biomass-to-energy plants to turn unused or unusable food into bio-fuel that replaces fossil fuels such as coal.
  </p>
        <p>
   Its food products and services business, ReFood UK, is the UK's leading operator of AD facilities that handle food wastes diverted from landfills. Another one of its food services business, T. Quality brand, is the UKs leading fish and chip shop supplier and fast-food wholesaler.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's pet food ingredient supplier SARVAL is one of the European pet food sector's largest suppliers of protein ingredients.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company has continued to find new ways to put its fats and meat-and-bone-meal to use. Its long-term strategy is to increase its investment in renewable energy through anaerobic digestion and recycling food waste from landfills.
  </p>
        <p>
   SARIA Ltd occasionally acquires other companies to expand its geographic reach and service line capabilities. In 2013, for example, the company acquired struggling Clutton (Agricultural) Limited, which provided services related to collecting fallen stock for farmers in the North Wales and Midlands regions.
