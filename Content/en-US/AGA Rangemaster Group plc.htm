   If it gets too hot in the kitchen, you may just want to stay. AGA Rangemaster Group manufactures household and kitchen equipment, which celebrity chefs adore. The group is a leading UK maker of household stoves (known as "cookers" in the UK), which are sold under the Aga, Rangemaster, and Rayburn brand names, among others. Kitchen products include refrigeration units (Marvel), cabinetry (Grange), sinks (Leisure), and cooking equipment (Falcon, La Cornue, Divertimenti). The company sells its cast-iron cookers and other kitchen equipment and furnishings through owned retail outlets. In late 2015, AGA Rangemaster Group was acquired by foodservice equipment giant

   Besides the Aga branded electric cookers, other brands include stainless steel and iron cast cookers made under the Heartland, Falcon, Waterford, and Stanley brands. Fired Earth makes furniture, as well as paint and tile for kitchen and bath. The company's sales strategy is focused on cross-selling and promoting various products together in packages that could include AGA, Fired Earth, Rangemaster, and AGA Marvel. Product development has included launching more Energy Star-rated products.

   The group keeps its core skills in-house and close to its core markets. Major product lines are manufactured in the UK, while France produces La Cornue cookware, and Canada makes Heartland products. The US makes and markets Marvel's undercounter refrigeration units to North American customers. Marvel consolidated its two US refrigeration plants and moved to a newly built factory in Michigan.
