   Jesús de Polanco was already a successful book publisher when he founded Promotora de Informaciones (Grupo Prisa) in 1972. The democratic-leaning Polanco soon tried to launch a newspaper, but the publication was banned by the regime of dictator Francisco Franco. After Franco's death in 1975, Polanco renewed his effort to publish a newspaper, and Grupo Prisa brought
   <i>
    El País
   </i>
   to the newsstands the following year. With its liberal slant, many soon identified
   <i>
    El País
   </i>
   with the opposition Socialist Party.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the Socialist Party came to power in Spain in 1982, Grupo Prisa began branching into new areas. Many suspected that the company's close ties with the Socialist government gave Grupo Prisa special privileges, facilitating its rapid expansion. Polanco transformed Grupo Prisa into a holding company in 1984, and that year the company invested in Spanish radio network Sociedad Española de Radiodifusión (SER). Juan Cebrián, who had helped found and was editor of
   <i>
    El País,
   </i>
   soon was named managing director and later became CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Grupo Prisa expanded into TV in 1989 when it entered into a deal with France's CANAL+ (now controlled by
   <company id="92356">
    Vivendi Universal
   </company>
   ) to bring pay-TV to Spain. The venture, Sociedad de Televisión Canal Plus, obtained the rights to three private Spanish TV franchises. Grupo Prisa ventured into movie production in 1990. It also embarked on an international drive, investing in newspaper and radio ventures across Europe and Mexico.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1996 Grupo Prisa's empire had expanded across new areas such as book publishing, graphic arts, magazines, and film distribution. That year Grupo Prisa and CANAL+ merged their Spanish film and TV holdings into a new company, Sogecable, which then launched Spanish digital satellite TV service Canal Satélite Digital (CSD).
  </p>
  <p>
   The road became decidedly rockier for Grupo Prisa after the conservative Popular Party came to power in Spain following the 1996 elections. The Spanish government, which favored Telefónica's digital TV service, made a number of attempts to block Sogecable's CSD service. Spanish courts began investigating alleged financial improprieties committed by Polanco and Sogecable. For a time, Polanco also was prohibited from leaving the country. The charges eventually were dropped. Ultimately, attempts to stymie the CSD service were unsuccessful.
  </p>
  <p>
   Grupo Prisa persevered and reorganized in 1998. Sogecable went public in 1999, with Grupo Prisa and CANAL+ Group each retaining stakes. Grupo Prisa continued expanding that year, creating music company Gran Vía Musical and acquiring ad firm Gerencia de Medios (GDM). Polanco also brought Santillana Group, a publishing firm he had founded in the 1960s, under the Grupo Prisa umbrella. In 2000 Polanco took Grupo Prisa public. Finding the US Hispanic market tempting, Grupo Prisa opened a New York City film production house, Plural Entertainment, in 2001. Also that year it acquired 50% of
   <company id="51043">
    Grupo Televisa's
   </company>
   radio unit, Sistema Radiópolis.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Grupo Prisa combined its printing business with those of British Polestar and Ibersuizas to create a new company, Dédalo Grupo Grafico (each company owns a 33.5% stake). In 2005 Grupo Prisa paid
   <company id="11824">
    Clear Channel Communications
   </company>
   $28 million for the broadcasting and operating rights to a Spanish-language AM-radio station in California. Also that year it acquired a 17% stake in French daily Le Monde.
  </p>
  <p>
   Plural signed a collaboration agreement with
   <company id="103440">
    Disney
   </company>
   in 2006 to produce entertainment geared toward the Hispanic population in the US.  In 2007 it acquired Portuguese media company Grupo Media Capital, purchasing shares of the firm from
   <company id="101299">
    RTL Group
   </company>
   . Also that year it increased its stake in Sogecable to 100%.
