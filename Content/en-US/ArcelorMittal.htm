   Few metal makers have the mettle of ArcelorMittal. The company is easily the largest steel-making entity in the world, producing more than 90 million metric tons of crude steel annually, about 6% of the world steel output. Operating in more than 60 countries, ArcelorMittal manufactures the full range of steel products: slabs and coil, coated steel and tinplate, wire rod and rebar, and billets and blooms, as well as all manner of electrical steel products. It also has 15 mining operations and is one of the world's largest iron ore producers. In 2014 it produced 77 million metric tons of iron ore and 7.7 million metric tons of metallurgical coal. CEO and founder Lakshmi Mittal controls about 39% of ArcelorMittal.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has steel-making operations in 19 countries on four continents, including 56 integrated and mini-mill steel-making facilities
  </p>
  <p>
   ArcelorMittal operates through subsidiaries in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas (including
   <company id="95212">
    ArcelorMittal Brasil
   </company>
   ). It's the largest producer of steel in North and South America, and Africa, the sixth-largest steel producer in the Commonwealth of Independent States region, and has a growing presence in Asia, including investments in China. It is also the largest steel producer in the European Union.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, many of ArcelorMittal's units have access to developing markets that are expected to experience significant future growth in steel consumption, such as Central and Eastern Europe, South America, India, Africa, and Russia. Overall, about 47% of its steel is produced in Europe, 38% in the Americas, and 15% in other countries such as Kazakhstan, South Africa, and Ukraine.

  <p>
   In 2014, ArcelorMittal reorganized from six to five reportable segments: NAFTA; Europe; Brazil; ACIS (Africa and CIS); and Mining.
  </p>
  <p>
   NAFTA produces flat, long and tubular products. Flat products include slabs, hot-rolled coil, cold-rolled coil, coated steel products, and plate. These products are sold primarily to customers in the following industries: distribution and processing; automotive; pipes and tubes; construction; packaging and appliances. In 2014 shipments from NAFTA totaled 23.1 million tons.
  </p>
  <p>
   Brazil makes flat (slabs, hot-rolled coil, cold-rolled coil and coated steel), long, and tubular products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Europe produces flat, long and tubular products. Flat products include hot-rolled coil, cold-rolled coil, coated products, tinplate, plate and slab. These products are sold primarily to customers in the automotive, general industry and packaging industries. In 2014, shipments from Europe totaled 39.6 million tons. (Europe contributed about 47% of ArcelorMittal's revenues that year).
  </p>
  <p>
   ACIS manufactures flat, long and tubular products at  six flat and long production plants in three countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mining provides the company's steel operations with high quality and low-cost iron ore and coal reserves and also sells limited amounts of mineral products to third parties. The company has mines in North and South America, Europe, the CIS, and Africa.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ArcelorMittal produces a wide variety of products across all steel-consuming industries, including the automotive, appliance, engineering, construction, energy, and machinery markets. The company sells its products in local markets and through a centralized marketing organization in more than 170 countries. Its strategy depends on maintaining its size and scale in the global steel market, vertical integration of its operations, producing a diverse portfolio of products, and continuously improving its quality.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's revenues have been declining in recent years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 ArcelorMittal's net sales decreased by 0.2% due to the reduced revenues from Asia, Africa, and Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company's net loss decreased by 62% due to lower cost of sales and net income attributable to non-controlling interests. Cost of sales was positively affected by a decrease in depreciation following a change in assessment of certain property plant and equipment and a decline in raw material prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was $112 million in 2014, as compared with net loss attributable to non-controlling interests of $30 million in 2013. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests increased in 2014 primarily as a result of income attributable to non-controlling interests in ArcelorMittal Mines Canada and Belgo Bekaert Arames, partially offset by losses generated in ArcelorMittal South Africa, which were however significantly lower than in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $426 million due to a change in inventories and trade accounts payable.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ArcelorMittal's strategy is to leverage four distinctive attributes that will enable it to capture leading positions in the most attractive areas of the steel industry value chain, from mining at one end to distribution and first-stage processing at the other. These are global scale and scope; unmatched technical capabilities; a diverse portfolio of steel and related businesses, particularly mining; and financial capability.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, ArcelorMittal entered into an agreement to establish the joint venture in Turkey, ArcelorMittal RZK Celik Servis Merkezi Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim Sirketi ('AM RZK').
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash, that year ArcelorMittal and
   <company id="55492">
    Gerdau
   </company>
   completed the sale of their respective 50% interests in
   <company id="110748">
    Gallatin Steel Company
   </company>
   , a flat rolled mini-mill located in Gallatin County, Kentucky, to
   <company id="11098">
    Nucor
   </company>
   for $770 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 ArcelorMittal also sold its 78% stake in European port handling and logistics company
   <company id="57918">
    ATIC Services
   </company>
   for EUR 155.4 million; its interest in the Kuzbass coal mines in the Kemerovo region of Siberia, Russia, to Russia's National Fuel Company; and diluted its stake in Algeria's Tebessa mines in Ouenza and Boukhadra .
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus on its core businesses and pay down debt, in 2013 the company sold 15% of its ArcelorMittal Mines Canada subsidiary to Chinese and Korean steelmakers for $1.1 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   ArcelorMittal became a conglomerate through acquisitions and strategic partnerships. In 2013 it formed a joint venture with
   <company id="41878">
    Nippon Steel &amp; Sumitomo Metal
   </company>
   to buy ThyssenKrupp Steel USA from
   <company id="59131">
    ThyssenKrupp
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2014 the ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel &amp; Sumitomo Metal joint venture acquired ThyssenKrupp Steel USA and its steel processing plant in Calvert, Alabama, for $1.6 billion. The Calvert plant has a total capacity of 5.3 million tons including hot rolling, cold rolling, coating and finishing lines. The deal is expected to deliver $60 million in annual savings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 ArcelorMittal also acquired control of the joint operation DJ Galvanizing, a hot dip galvanizing line located in Canada, through the acquisition of the 50% interest held by the other joint operator.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ArcelorMittal is the product of decades of steelmaking by India's Mittal family. In 1967 patriarch Mohan Mittal unsuccessfully tried to open a steel mill in Egypt. He and his four younger brothers then set up a steel company in India, but squabbles pushed Mohan to chart his own course, eventually giving rise to an empire that flourished under the Ispat name. Mohan's son Lakshmi began working part-time at the family steel mill while in school; he started full-time at 21, after graduating in 1971.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mohan set up an operation in Indonesia in 1975 (Ispat Indo) and put Lakshmi in charge. The next year, fueled by ambitions and held back by government regulations in India, Lakshmi formed Ispat International in Jakarta, Indonesia, to focus on expansion through acquisitions. He spent the next decade strengthening the Indonesian operations and perfecting the minimill process using direct-reduced iron (DRI).
  </p>
  <p>
   Ispat took advantage of the recessionary late 1980s and early 1990s by making a string of acquisitions. In 1988 it took over the management of Trinidad and Tobago's state steel companies (bought in 1994; renamed Caribbean Ispat).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 Ispat bought Mexico's third-largest (albeit bankrupt) steel and DRI producer. Two years later it acquired Canada's Sidbec-Dosco steelmaker. Also that year Lakshmi took exclusive control of international operations, leaving his brothers Pramod and Vinod to control the Indian divisions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The mid-1990s brought more acquisitions: In 1995 Ispat bought Germany's Hamburger Stahlwerks and a mill in Kazakhstan. The next year it purchased Ireland's only steelmaker, Irish Steel. Lakshmi moved to London in 1996 and purchased a home on Bishops Avenue, known as "millionaire's row." (Saudi Arabia's King Fahd was a neighbor.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 the company bought the long-product (wire rod) division of Germany's Thyssen AG (renamed Ispat Stahlwerk Ruhrort and Ispat Walzdraht Hochfeld). It also completed a $776 million IPO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ispat acquired Chicago-based Inland Steel in 1998 (and renamed it Ispat Inland), including the steel-finishing operations of I/N Tek (60% Inland-owned joint venture with Nippon Steel) and I/N Kote (50% Inland-owned joint venture with NSC).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Ispat formed a joint venture with Mexican steelmaker Grupo Imsa to make flat-rolled steel to sell throughout most of the Americas. It also paid $96 million for France-based Usinor's Unimétal, Tréfileurope, and Société Métallurgique de Révigny subsidiaries, which specialize in carbon long products. That year Ispat Inland became the target of a US federal criminal grand jury investigation and a related civil lawsuit for allegedly defrauding the Louisiana Highway Department. (The case was settled for $30 million, with the cost split between Ispat Inland and Contech Construction Products Inc. of Ohio.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company responded to a downturn in the steel industry by starting a Web-based joint venture with Commerce One to connect buyers and sellers in the worldwide metals market. It also offered to buy VSZ, Slovakia's #1 steelworks, but was outbid by U.S. Steel.
  </p>
  <p>
   After struggling with heavy debt, high labor and energy costs, new environmental regulations, and EU steel quotas in 2001, Ispat closed down its subsidiary, Irish Ispat, which accounted for about 2% of the parent company's steel production.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company's 51%-owned pipe making subsidiary, Productura Mexicana de Tuberia, sold almost all of its production assets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The present ArcelorMittal was forged in 2004 when Ispat International (of which the Mittal family owned 70%) purchased LNM Holdings (wholly owned by the Mittals) for $13 billion. In 2006, the former Mittal Steel agreed to buy rival
   <company id="103869">
    Arcelor
   </company>
   for about $34 billion to create ArcelorMittal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mittal Steel had established its hold on the world steel market through its 2005 purchase of the US-based
   <company id="105951">
    International Steel Group
   </company>
   (ISG) for $4.5 billion. The purchase made the company the largest steel producer (ahead of
   <company id="12969">
    U.S. Steel
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11098">
    Nucor
   </company>
   ) in the US, a market that had long been a targeted area for expansion for CEO Mittal. Once the deal closed, the company combined ISG's operations with those of subsidiary
   <company id="111197">
    Ispat Inland
   </company>
   to form a single North American entity, Mittal Steel USA (now
   <company id="138179">
    ArcelorMittal USA
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2005, Mittal Steel acquired a 93% stake in Ukrainian state-run steel company KryvorizhStal with the winning $4.84 billion bid in an auction held by the Ukrainian government. The price was high, but Mittal was anxious to gain a stronger foothold in the region -- and to keep its rivals away from KryvorizhStal. (This fact, incidentally, went a long way to convincing Mittal it needed to combine with Arcelor; the competition for acquisitions was driving prices dramatically upward.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also began to broaden its portfolio outside the steel industry, dipping its toe into the energy business. In mid-2005 Mittal formed two joint ventures with India's government-controlled
   <company id="57106">
    Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation
   </company>
   : one to buy stakes in foreign oil and gas projects, the other involved in oil and gas trading and shipping. The ventures began to look for business in places like Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Angola, and Trinidad and Tobago.
  </p>
  <p>
   After consolidating his family's various steel interests in the early part of this decade, Mittal began work on the steel industry as a whole and was soon the world's largest steel producer.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 2006, Mittal Steel no longer was content to be merely the world's largest steel producer; it wanted to dominate the market. The company announced an offer to the shareholders of Arcelor, then the industry's #2 player, to buy that company and, in the process, create the world's first 100-million-ton steel producer. Arcelor, and seemingly half the governments of Western Europe, initially fought the attempt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mittal improved its proposed price, however, and Arcelor's board finally approved the offer when Mittal also made ownership/corporate governance concessions. The combined company is 43% owned by the Mittal family. After a few months of a transitional management team arrangement, Lakshmi Mittal took over as CEO of the combined company toward the end of 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 ArcelorMittal completed its acquisition of the laser-welding steel activities of
   <company id="53784">
    Noble International
   </company>
   , a leader in the niche industry. It also acquired Mexican steel producer Sicarsta for nearly $1.5 billion, an acquisition that, combined with its Lazaro Cardenas, created Mexico's largest steel company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011, the company spun off its stainless and specialty steels steel operations into
   <company id="162205">
    Aperam
   </company>
   , which immediately became the world's sixth-largest stainless steel producer. ArcelorMittal made the decision in 2010 to spin off its stainless steel units in Europe and Brazil after determining that they were underperforming and would better thrive as a separate business.
  </p>
  <p>
   After spinning its wheels in an escalating bidding war, in 2011 ArcelorMittal joined rival Nunavut Iron Ore in making a joint acquisition of Canada-based
   <company id="160601">
    Baffinland Iron Mines
   </company>
   for $594 million. Both companies sought access to Baffinland's Mary River Project, an undeveloped deposit of iron ore on sparsely populated North Baffin Island located inside the Arctic Circle, as a source of raw materials. The venture faces stiff challenges, including building an infrastructure around the mine's formidable location, and shipping the ore out to Europe and other production sites.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year, the company bought a 40% stake in G Steel Public Company, greatly expanding its presence in Asia. G Steel produces about 2.5 million ton of steel annually at its two slab-rolling plants in Thailand. The deal was part of ArcelorMittal's strategy of establishing a presence in emerging markets with with the potential for future growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 ArcelorMittal expanded its presence in China by increasing its stake in a joint venture with Valin Group, known as Valin ArcelorMittal Automotive (VAMA), from 33% to 49%. VAMA is trying to enhance its position in China as a supplier of high-strength steels and products for the automotive market. The joint venture, scheduled to become operational in 2014, will increase its planned capacity from 1.2 million tons to 1.5 million tons.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it sold New Jersey-based Skyline Steel, a North American steel foundation and piling products distributor, and specialty steel plate and bar producer Astralloy to US-based Nucor for $605 million.
