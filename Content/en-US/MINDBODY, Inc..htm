   The goal of many fitness programs is to help the mind and body work together. The goal of Mindbody Inc. is to help fitness and wellness companies integrate front and back office functions into a smooth operation. The company offers a Software-as-a-Service platform for small businesses gathered under the wellness umbrella (yoga, massage, fitness centers, pilates, spin-cycling studios, spas, salons, and more) to schedule appointments and manage billing and payments. Mindbody counts more than 42,000 local business subscribers. It went public with a stock offering in June 2015.

   Mindbody has developed mobile applications consumers and corporations. The company's Connect platform lets customers of wellness and fitness providers book and pay for fitness programs and find other providers using the Mindbody platform.

   Mindbody is a subscription-based service. Pricing had been based on the number of service providers employed by a subscribing company. But in 2015, Mindbody began basing subscription pricing for new subscribers on software functionality. Most of Mindbody's customers prepay their monthly subscriptions. The company also gets revenue based on the value of transactions processed by subscribers on Mindbody's payment platform, net of the costs charged to Mindbody by its processing vendors. More than $4 billion in transactions were processed over the platform in 2014.
