   LifeLock is trying to put a choke hold on identity theft. One of the fastest growing privately-held companies in the US and a leader in the security industry, LifeLock serves consumers and businesses in the US, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands with its identity theft protection and detection services. Members pay annual or monthly subscription fees to receive alerts about potentially fraudulent credit applications made in their names. Its eRecon and TrueAddress services search the Web for illegal selling and trading of personal information, as well as fraudulent address change attempts. LifeLock was founded in 2005, and went public in a 2012 IPO. In 2016 the company agreed to sell to

    Symantec
   </company>
   for $2.3 billion.

  <p>
   The acquisition by Symantec is expected to close in early 2017. The deal brings the key element of identity and fraud protection provided by Lifelock into Symantec's security products. Lifelock said the availability of Symantec products will benefit its customers.

  <p>
   Following the acquisition of ID Analytics, LifeLock began operating its business using two reportable segments: consumer segment and enterprise segment. In fiscal 2012 the consumer segment contributed about 92% of the company's total revenues.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's revenues increased by 34% in fiscal 2013 compared to the previous year. It reported revenue of $369.6 million in fiscal 2013, up from $276.4 million in fiscal 2012. The revenue spike was largely the result of an increase in members.
  </p>
  <p>
   The increase in members also had a positive effect on the company's net income and cash flow. Lifelock's net income increased dramatically (by more than $28 million) in fiscal 2013 compared to the prior fiscal period. The company claimed net income of $52.451 million for fiscal 2013 after claiming about $23.5 million in net income for fiscal 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lifelock's net cash flow increased by more than $28.9 million in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. The company had $48.4 million in net cash on hand at the end of 2012 and roughly $77.3 million on hand at the end of 2013.

  <p>
   If its proactive information collection services fail to stop identity theft, LifeLock offers its members a $1 million service guarantee, which covers the cost of hiring investigators, lawyers, and consultants to help with all the legal paperwork needed to restore a person's name. It also offers identity theft training and education for both law enforcement and consumers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through a partnership with the National Organization for Victim Assistance (NOVA), LifeLock staff members are trained in post-identity theft support services, such as crisis intervention and victim response. NOVA, a not-for-profit organization, has been a second responder in crises ranging from 9/11 to Hurricane Katrina. Its programs and advocates mainly focus on victims' rights and emotional support services.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2013 the company acquired mobile wallet maker Lemon, Inc for about $42.4 million. Back in March 2012 LifeLock purchased ID Analytics, which it now operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary.
