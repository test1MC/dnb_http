        <p>
   Noranda Aluminum succeeds by keeping its operations -- and profits -- all under the same corporate roof. The company, a vertically integrated aluminum producer, starts the process by producing bauxite in a Jamaican mining project, refining it into alumina in a Louisiana smelter, and then using the alumina to make primary aluminum metal products at its processing facility in Missouri and aluminum coils at four flat rolling facilities in the Southeast. Noranda's primary aluminum products include aluminum rods, extruded billets, and foundry ingots. The downstream business segment manufactures foil and light sheet metal.

        <p>
   Noranda has four operating segments: Bauxite, used for alumina production; Alumina (the refining and convertion of bauxite into alumina, the principal raw material for primary aluminum production); Primary Aluminum (value-added aluminum products including billet, rod, sow, and foundry); Flat-Rolled Products (such as finstock and container stock). The company's upstream business produces about 261,000 tons of primary aluminum annually, accounting for about 12% of total US primary aluminum production in 2012. Its downstream business offers a combined annual production capacity of 410 - 495 million pounds and ranks among the largest foil producers in North America.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company operates four rolling mills in the Southeastern US (two in Huntingdon, Tennessee, and one each in Salisbury, North Carolina and Newport, Arkansas). Noranda has an aluminum smelter in New Madrid, Missouri, bauxite mining operations in St. Ann, Jamaica, and an alumina refinery in Gramercy, Louisiana.

        <p>
   Noranda's customers, primarily located in the US, include original equipment manufacturers of air conditioners, transformers, containers, and foil packaging. Noranda's 10 largest customers represent more than 40% of its primary aluminum product sales, with a majority of customers located within a one-day truck delivery distance from its downstream operations in Missouri, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Arkansas. In 2012
   <company id="110006">
    Sherwin Alumina
   </company>
   accounted for 47% of the company's bauxite sales.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Noranda's revenues decreased by 11% in 2012 due to commodity prices and lower alumina, bauxite, and primary aluminum sales volumes. Net income dropped by 65% in 2012 as the result of lower revenues, higher interest expenses (related to new and existing senior secured credit facilities) and higher refinancing expenses.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company plans to continue expanding its production capacity in both its upstream and downstream segments, growing both organically and through strategic acquisitions.
  </p>
        <p>
   (The company completed its vertical integration strategy in 2009 when it gained full control of its alumina and bauxite operations. Noranda purchased all shares of the St. Ann bauxite mining operation in Jamaica and the Gramercy, Louisiana, alumina refinery operation from joint venture partner Century Aluminum). In 2012 Noranda announced plans to invest in increasing the harbor capacity at St. Ann.

   Apollo gained control of Noranda in 2007 when it acquired the aluminum operations from Swiss metals company Xstrata (since renamed
   <company id="101467">
    Glencore
   </company>
   ). In 2006 Xstrata bought
   <company id="54118">
    Falconbridge
   </company>
   , to which a former version of Noranda had changed its name. Apollo  resurrected the Noranda Aluminum name when it took over the operations from Xstrata in 2007. Through an IPO

    ,
   </em>
   Noranda Aluminum went public in 2010. The IPO brought in about $83 million after expenses, which the company used to pay down and repurchase some of its debt.
