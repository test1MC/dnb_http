   Dow Jones operates as a subsidiary of
   <company id="163064">
    News Corporation
   </company>
   and is part of its parent company's News and Information Services business segment, which in fiscal 2013 generated about 72% of revenue. The segment makes money from business-to-consumer and business-to-business subscriptions, print and digital ad sales, and licensing fees for its print and digital products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Besides Dow Jones, other companies in the revenue-generating segment include News Corp Australia, News UK, the
   <em>
    New York Post
   </em>
   , and News America Marketing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Products targeting consumers include print, digital, and video versions of
   <em>
    The Wall Street Journal
   </em>
   , print and digital versions of
   <em>
    Barron's
   </em>

  <p>
   Recently rolled out, DJX is the comprehensive Dow Jones product that targets enterprise customers. Launched in early 2013, DJX aims to provide customers with a unified product experience, rather than a bundling of underlying products.

   Like most other news publishers, Dow Jones relies heavily on advertising, subscriptions, and circulation fees for most of its revenue. The company's flagship newspaper continues to buck industry trends with strong circulation figures, while its online companion (run through the
   <company id="103480">
    Wall Street Journal Digital Network
   </company>
   ) is one of the few news websites to succeed at generating revenue through subscriptions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's prospering units have not shielded it from the challenges facing the newspaper industry, however. In 2013 it sold its
   <company id="108784">
    Dow Jones Local Media Group
   </company>
   local newspaper subsidiary to Fortress Investment Group, as those papers struggled with declining readership along with the rest of the industry. Other operations such as MarketWatch and
   <em>
    Barron's
   </em>
   have been hurt in recent years by declines in ad revenue. In response, Dow Jones is focused on improving efficiencies within its news-gathering operations, combining its consumer publications and news services division. It later purchased the 50% of
   <em>
    SmartMoney
   </em>
   magazine it didn't already own from
   <company id="40209">
    Hearst
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to cut expenses and focus on its publishing operations, Dow Jones in 2010 sold 90% of its financial index business to
   <company id="56097">
    CME Group
   </company>
   , the owner of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the remaining 10% stake to CME in 2013.

  <p>
   Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser founded Dow Jones &amp; Company (1882), which delivered handwritten bulletins of stock and bond trading news to New York subscribers. In 1883 Dow Jones started summarizing the trading day in the
   <i>
    Customers' Afternoon Letter,
   </i>
   which evolved into
   <i>
    The Wall Street Journal
   </i>
   (1889). Jones sold out to his partners in 1899; three years later Dow and Bergstresser sold the company to Clarence Barron. In 1921 the company introduced
   <i>
    Barron's National Business and Financial Weekly.
   </i>
  </p>
  <p>
   Bernard Kilgore, who was appointed managing editor in 1941, shaped the format of the
   <i>
    Journal
   </i>
   that has endured to this day. During the 1960s the company saw the newspaper's circulation exceed 1 million. With its acquisition of the Ottaway group and investments in the
   <i>
    Far Eastern Economic Review
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    The Asian Wall Street Journal
   </i>
   during the 1970s, Dow Jones expanded into community and international publications. It launched
   <i>
    The Wall Street Journal Europe
   </i>
   in 1983 and between 1985 and 1990 acquired Telerate, a real-time financial data network that it renamed Dow Jones Markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Peter Kann, who joined
   <i>
    The Journal
   </i>
   as a reporter in 1964, became chairman and CEO of the company in 1991. The next year Dow Jones teamed with
   <company id="40209">
    Hearst
   </company>
   to launch
   <i>
    SmartMoney
   </i>
   magazine. A 1992 alliance with BellSouth to provide telephone access to Dow Jones reports and a 1994 venture with
   <company id="103981">
    American City Business Journals
   </company>
   to publish a monthly magazine fared less well, and both were discontinued in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 the company shut down its unprofitable Dow Jones Investor Network (a video news service started in 1993) and tried to revive the ailing Dow Jones Markets service by announcing a $650 million revamp. Also that year Dow Jones agreed to provide content to
   <company id="115587">
    CNBC
   </company>
   and teamed with
   <company id="47376">
    NBC
   </company>
   to launch CNBC in Europe and Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Charges associated with Dow Jones Markets led to a sizable loss for 1997, and the company sold the unit to
   <company id="42781">
    Bridge Information Systems
   </company>
   for $510 million the next year. It cut staffing costs in 1998 when more than 500 employees accepted severance packages. That year Dow Jones announced it would expand the number of pages and color capacity of
   <i>
    The Journal,
   </i>
   and inked deals to distribute its newswires through
   <company id="41832">
    Reuters
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="40671">
    Bloomberg
   </company>
   , and Bridge.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company joined the
   <i>
    Financial Times
   </i>
   and Independent Media in 1999 to launch a Russian-language business newspaper,
   <i>
    Vedomosti.
   </i>
   It also formed a joint venture --
   <company id="59927">
    Factiva
   </company>
   -- with Reuters that combined their online news databases. In addition, Dow Jones began offering
   <i>
    The Wall Street Journal Sunday,
   </i>
   a weekly package of articles that originally appeared in more than 15 US newspapers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Dow Jones joined with Excite@Home to form online business network Work.com. (Work.com was shut down the next year, and its Internet address was sold to
   <company id="103149">
    Business.com
   </company>
   .) Dow Jones hit hard times in 2001 as the economy soured; it laid off some 200 workers as a result of declining ad revenue and increased the cover price of its flagship paper. Also in 2001 the company increased the price of
   <i>
    The Journal
   </i>
   for the first time in more than a decade. That year the company combined the news operations of
   <i>
    Far Eastern Economic Review
   </i>
   weekly magazine with
   <i>
    The Asian Wall Street Journal
   </i>
   to improve efficiencies.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the economy failed to pick up, the company eliminated another 230 jobs in 2002 (including 5% of the news staff at
   <i>
    The Wall Street Journal
   </i>
   ). The company was dealt a devastating blow when
   <i>
    Wall Street Journal
   </i>
   reporter Daniel Pearl, who had been kidnapped in Pakistan by suspected Islamic militants, was killed by his captors. That year the company sold four of its Ottaway daily newspapers (
   <i>
    The Daily Independent
   </i>
   in Ashland, Kentucky;
   <i>
    The Free Press
   </i>
   in Mankato, Minnesota;
   <i>
    The Herald
   </i>
   in Sharon, Pennsylvania; and
   <i>
    The Joplin Globe
   </i>
   in Missouri) to
   <company id="57755">
    Community Newspaper Holdings
   </company>
   for $182 million. Later that year Ottaway sold three of its Massachusetts-based papers (
   <i>
    The Salem Evening News, The Newburyport Daily News,
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    The Gloucester Daily Times
   </i>
   ) to
   <company id="116524">
    Eagle Tribune Publishing Company
   </company>
   for $70 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2002 the company decided to stop publication of
   <i>
    The Asian Wall Street Journal Weekly,
   </i>
   which was circulated mainly in the US. Later that year Subsidiary Ottaway Newspapers bought two publications from
   <company id="10886">
    Lee Enterprises
   </company>
   . Also in 2002 Dow Jones began a joint venture with Italian media company
   <company id="99123">
    Class Editori
   </company>
   to produce and sell business and financial news in Italian. In 2003 Dow Jones acquired Technologic Partners, a newsletter publisher and conference organizer.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004
   <em>
    Journal
   </em>
   reporters withheld their bylines from their articles for several days as part of an ongoing labor dispute. A short time later, the company and its main union reached a tentative agreement on a new contract. The contract was ratified in August 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dow Jones purchased a leading German financial content provider from wvd-Vereinigte Wirtschaftsdienste GmbH in 2004 and began to market the content under the brand name Dow Jones-VWD News.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired the venture-capital news provider Alternative Investor Group, a unit of Wicks Business Information, for $85 million, in 2004. That year the company announced that its
   <em>
    Far Eastern Economic Review
   </em>
   would move from a weekly to a monthly publication and that most of its staff would be cut. Dow Jones acquired popular financial news site
   <company id="58506">
    MarketWatch
   </company>
   for $519 million in 2005. The company eliminated nearly 100 jobs in the transition, mostly at MarketWatch. In late 2005 the company sold its interests in CNBC Europe and CNBC Asia to
   <company id="128633">
    NBCUniversal
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold its nearly 40% stake in F.F. Soucy, a Canadian newsprint mill, in 2005 to
   <company id="105425">
    Brant-Allen Industries
   </company>
   . COO Richard Zannino was promoted to CEO in 2006, replacing Kann (who stayed on as chairman until 2007). Late that year Dow Jones acquired the 50% stake in Factiva owned by partner Reuters. It also sold six newspapers from its Ottaway subsidiary to
   <company id="57755">
    Community Newspaper Holdings
   </company>
   for $280 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 media conglomerate
   <company id="41816">
    News Corporation
   </company>
   , controlled by Rupert Murdoch, acquired Dow Jones for $5.6 billion. Former
   <company id="90297">
    News International
   </company>
   chief Leslie Hinton replaced Zannino as head of Dow Jones following the buyout. The company renamed its Ottaway Newspapers unit
   <company id="108784">
    Dow Jones Local Media
   </company>
   in 2009. The following year Dow Jones sold its stock market index information service business, including the well-known Dow Jones Industrial Average, to
   <company id="56097">
    CME Group
   </company>
   . The deal gave CME a 90% stake in the indices' joint venture and valued the business at about $675 million.
