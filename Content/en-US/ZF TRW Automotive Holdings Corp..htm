   ZF TRW Automotive makes cars stop and go around the globe, in addition to keeping passengers and pedestrians safe. The company designs and makes systems, components, and modules primarily for major automakers. Product lines range from chassis systems (brake, steering, and suspension systems) to safety systems, such as airbags, seat belts, and security and safety electronics (crash and occupant weight sensors). Other products include body controls and engine valves. The company has about 190 facilities in two dozen countries worldwide, netting 75% of its sales outside North America. In 2015 TRW Automotive was acquired by German-based

   In 2015 TRW was acquired by German-based transmissions maker
   <company id="91247">
    ZF Friedrichshafen
   </company>
   . TRW was incorporated into ZF as a new division called Active &amp; Passive Safety Technology.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ZF TRW operates globally with a focused presence within Brazil, China, the Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, Spain, the UK, and the US. The US accounts for nearly 25% of net sales. Other major markets include China (18%) and Germany (12%).

  <p>
   ZF TRW divides its operations across four chief segments. Chassis Systems generates the most revenue (around 65% of total sales) and makes brake control, steering, and linkage and suspension products. Occupant Safety Systems (around 20% of sales) makes airbags, seat belts, steering wheels, and other related products, while Automotive Components (10%) makes engine valves, body controls, and fasteners. Electronics (roughly 5%) manufactures radio frequency and electrical components used to make electric power steering, vehicle control, and safety systems.

   Four OEM groups generate more than 60% of sales:

  <p>
   ZF TRW has enjoyed several straight years of historic growth. Revenues peaked at a record-breaking $17.54 billion in 2014. The historic growth for 2014 was driven by higher demand for its active and passive safety products and growth in vehicle production across its major markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's profits, however, nosedived by 70% from $970 million in 2013 to $293 million in 2014. This was attributed to higher pension and post-retirement benefit settlement expenses. ZF TRW's operating cash flow has fluctuated over the years; after increasing in 2013, cash flow declined 172% to $954 million in 2014.

  <p>
   ZF TRW caters to a diverse client base by partnering with other companies with innovative technologies and opening new plants in key geographic locations that expand the company's presence in new and existing markets. In 2012 it launched in Brazil a new regional production base for making auto parts across South America. The newly launched facilities are focused on producing and selling electric power steering parts and components. During 2013 ZF TRW opened a new facility in Baia Mare, Romania, and in 2014 it opened its largest ever technical center located in Anting, China.

   In early 2015, ZF TRW divested its engine valve business for $385 million in cash to
   <company id="10557">
    Federal-Mogul Corporation
   </company>
   . The company made the sale in order to focus solely on its more profitable safety technologies portfolio.
