   The products of Yeo Valley Farms have spread in a natural, organic way, of course. From its 1,200-acre farm near Blagdon Lake in North Somerset, the company sends its dairy products throughout the UK. The company began making private-label yogurt for retailers back in 1974, and it now makes one of the best-selling natural yogurt brands in the UK. It produces some 1,250 tons of yogurt a week. The company also makes milk, cream, crème fraîche, cheese, butter, and ice cream. Along with its Yeo Valley and Yeo Valley Organic brands, it still produces private-label dairy products, as well as Madagascar brand organic ice cream and Yeo Valley brand yogurts. Yeo Valley distributes its products to major food retailers like

   The company operates three dairies -- the Blagdon Dairy, the Cannington Dairy, and the Newton Abbot Dairy. Its main corporate headquarters is known as The Mendip Centre. Yeo Valley sources milk from the Organic Milk Suppliers Co-operative (OMSCo) and from its own herd.
