   Trusted Media Brands, Inc., (TMBI, formerly The Reader's Digest Association) publishes the undersized general-interest magazine Reader's Digest, which boasts 50 editions and is translated into some 20 languages. In addition to publishing its flagship title, the company operates about 60 branded websites. It leverages its extensive consumer database of more than 140 million subscribers to market books (such as Reader's Digest Select Editions, how-to guides, and cookbooks), special-interest magazines, music, videos, and financial and health products in 76 countries. Suffering from a heavy debt-load amid a down economy, TMBI has twice filed Chapter 11 for its US businesses in recent years.

  <p>
   The company has been hit by higher debts due to the down economic conditions, In 2009, the company filed for Chapter 11, and emerged a year later. At the beginning of 2013, with $1.1 billion in assets and just under $1.2 billion in debt, the company's parent filed for Chapter 11 protection again. It emerged from bankruptcy in July 2013.

   In 2014 the company partnered with Gold Mobile and its platform to enhance TMBI's print offerings by integrating mobile promotions. Through this deal advertisers can use these mobile promotions to provide extra information about their products, direct consumers to their website, or gain feedback. In 2013 TMBI teamed up with TriVu Media to create 'HOME OnDEMAND, which matches up billions of video advertising opportunities for auction/sale on various exchanges and demand-side platforms, with highly detailed information about the actual video.
  </p>
  <p>
   With a focus on expanding its Canadian markets, that year the company launched its newest magazine, Taste of Home Canada, a north of the border version of the popular US original.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 TMBI licensed Reader's Digest France, French Belgium, Finland, and Sweden to SAPE and its Poland, Romania, and Hungary publications to Tarsago Media Group.

  <p>
   DeWitt "Wally" Wallace started in the publishing business before WWI, with a book on farming that included information from agricultural bulletins. After serving in the war, he assembled a collection of "digested" articles, which he used while trying to find a job as an editor in New York. When this failed, in 1921 he and his wife, Lila, sold subscriptions to their then-nonexistent digest by direct mail. In 1922 they produced the first issue of
   <em>
    Reader's Digest
   </em>
   . It was an immediate success, but fearing magazines would sue them for using the articles, the Wallaces did not expand into newsstand sales until 1929. Circulation reached one million by 1935.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1940s the
   <i>
    Digest
   </i>
   expanded internationally (the first overseas edition started in England in 1938), opening offices on five continents. During that decade Wally began to write his own articles, imparting to the
   <i>
    Digest
   </i>
   the conservative, optimistic style beloved by its readers. Also in the 1940s Wally's wife Lila Bell Acheson Wallace started collecting art, creating one of the first corporate collections in the country. The collection included paintings by Renoir, Chagall, Degas, and van Gogh.
  </p>
  <p>
   The first Reader's Digest Condensed Book was published in 1950. Five years later the
   <i>
    Digest
   </i>
   accepted its first advertising, but did not carry liquor ads until 1978 and has never carried cigarette ads.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm added the Recorded Music Division in 1959 and General Books in 1963. Reader's Digest was the first publisher to use direct-mail advertising with personalized letters to promote its products. It also used its huge database for promotions such as the Reader's Digest Sweepstakes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Wallaces continued to manage the company until 1973. Wally died in 1981; Lila, three years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   George Grune took over as CEO in 1984. He cut staff and disposed of unprofitable subsidiaries, ushering in an era of increased profitability for the company. He also added specialty magazines, including
   <i>
    Family Handyman
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Moneywise.
   </i>
   The company went public in 1990.
  </p>
  <p>
   Grune was succeeded in 1994 by James Schadt, who planned to diversify. In 1997 the company purchased
   <i>
    Walking
   </i>
   magazine from Cowles Media. Schadt, whose revitalization efforts yielded slight returns, resigned that year. Grune returned as CEO and began to undo Schadt's diversification efforts. He drew the fire of activist shareholders, who charged that his position as chairman of the DeWitt Wallace and Lila Wallace funds posed a conflict of interest. The matter was settled in 1998 when Reader's Digest hired Thomas Ryder as CEO. Also that year the company auctioned about $85 million worth of its art collection, including works by Monet and Renoir.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 the company announced it would produce TV programming with CBS. It also sold struggling
   <i>
    American Health
   </i>
   magazine to Time Inc., purchased display marketer Books Are Fun, and bought a minority stake in membership club operator BrandDirect Marketing. On the Internet front, Reader's Digest launched 80%-owned Gifts.com (StarTek owns the rest) and entered into a cross-promotional alliance with health care site WebMD. (Gifts.com ceased operations in 2002.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Reader's Digest launched a health Web site, RDHealth.com, in 2000. (The separate health Web site has since been folded into the Reader's Digest site.) Also that year it announced that
   <i>
    Reader's Digest
   </i>
   would be revamped with a new cover and additional features. (The changes were made in the fall of 2001.) In 2001 the company shut down
   <i>
    Walking
   </i>
   magazine and began restructuring its books and entertainment division. The company bought rural-focused magazine publisher Reiman Publication in 2002. Late in 2002 Reader's Digest struck a deal with the
   <company id="44345">
    William Morris Agency
   </company>
   to expand its brand into television, movies, and radio. The company followed that deal with one with Universal Press Syndicate to distribute
   <i>
    Reader's Digest
   </i>
   magazine content to newspapers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Reader's Digest sold its headquarters property in Pleasantville, New York, for $59 million. In late 2005 the company announced that Ryder would step down in 2006 and will be replaced by executive Eric Schrier. Schrier took over as CEO in early 2006 and Ryder stayed on as chairman until the end of the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund and the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund, named for the founders, once owned 50% of the company's voting shares. Responding to pressure from investors about the company's convoluted ownership structure, the DeWitt Wallace and Lila Wallace funds instituted a stock recapitalization plan and sold off their ownership stake in the company. In a deal that Schrier called "a great opportunity," in 2007 the company was acquired by investor group Ripplewood Holdings, and Mary Berner succeeded Schrier as CEO.

   In 2008 RDA revamped its RD.com website, adding a set of new community features and promising more daily content and video. RDA expanded its offerings with the launch of
   <em>
    Best Health
   </em>
   (a healthy lifestyle magazine for Canadian women) and
   <em>
    Discovery Channel Magazine
   </em>
   in Asia (a collaboration with
   <company id="43731">
    Discovery Communications
   </company>
   ). Beefing up its food focused content, in 2008 the company launched
   <em>
    Healthy Cooking
   </em>
   , an offshoot of its
   <em>
    Taste of Home
   </em>
   title that is focused on lighter food and nutrition-related topics.
  </p>
  <p>
   RDA sold the intellectual property and product inventory assets of its
   <company id="138036">
    Books Are Fun
   </company>
   (BAF) unit, a direct marketer of books and gifts, to
   <company id="160917">
    Imagine Nation Books
   </company>
   in 2008. RDA received approximately $17.5 million, payable over three years, from the asset sale.
  </p>
  <p>
   RDA's US businesses filed for Chapter 11 in 2009, emerging from bankruptcy the following year. An investment group led by JPMorgan Chase, eventually taking the name RDA Holding Co., became the company's new owners. Later in 2010 the board named Fredric G. Reynolds as its new chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to focus on its core media and marketing assets, in 2010 the company sold its CompassLearning educational software division. In addition, it deconsolidated its UK subsidiary. More cost-cutting efforts came later that year, including reducing RDA's global headcount by more than 10%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 RDA sold
   <em>
    Every Day with Rachel Ray
   </em>
   . Also that year Berner stepped down as CEO. She was replaced by then-CFO Tom Williams. The company sold Weekly Reader and AllRecipes.com in 2012.
