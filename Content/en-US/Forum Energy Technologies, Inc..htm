   There is a proper forum for everything; for oil and natural gas drilling and control equipment it would be Forum Energy Technologies. The company designs, makes, and sells equipment for global customers including drilling contractors, oilfield service businesses, equipment rental companies, and assemblers of drilling and well servicing equipment. Drilling products include tubular handling equipment and drilling data-management systems. Flow control products include expendable fluid end-components for mud and centrifugal pumps, valves, choke and kill manifolds, and pressure control equipment. It also makes remote operating vehicles (ROVs) for subsea work.

  <p>

  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   A global player, Forum Energy Technologies has manufacturing operations in Texas. It has sales and distribution centers in the US, and Canada, as well in Singapore, the UAE, and the UK. It also has regional representative offices in Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US accounted for 63% of the company's revenues in 2012; Europe &amp; Africa, 14%.

  <p>
   The company operates in two segments: Drilling and Subsea (drilling, subsea, and well construction, completion and intervention product design and manufacture, and related services); and Production and Infrastructure (the provision of equipment and services to the well stimulation, completion, production, and infrastructure markets).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Forum Energy Technologies' revenues increased by 25% in 2012 largely due to a Drilling and Subsea revenues jump of 25% as a result of increased sales of hydraulic catwalk units and blowout preventers (Drilling Technologies product line), and higher sales of ROVs in the Subsea Technologies product line. Production and Infrastructure revenues grew by 26% due to higher market demand for production equipment and valves as well as because of orders from new customers. The 2011 expansion of existing facilities and the addition of new facilities in Pennsylvania enabled higher shipments in the Production Equipment segment in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income increased by 62% in 2012 thanks to higher revenues and decreased interest expenses due to lower debt levels as a result of repaying a portion of Forum Energy Technologies' debt from the net proceeds of the IPO and concurrent private placement.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the exception of 2009, when the global economic recession stymied demand and caused revenues to slump, the company saw an upward trend in revenues from 2008 to 2012.
