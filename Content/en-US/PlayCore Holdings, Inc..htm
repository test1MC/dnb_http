   Child's play is at the core of PlayCore. The company makes playground equipment for residential and commercial markets. Its Swing-N-Slide unit offers prepackaged do-it-yourself wooden play sets that are sold at US home centers and hardware stores. Its GameTime, Play &amp; Park Structures, Ultra Play, and Big Toys units cater to the commercial niche with metal and plastic playground systems for schools and parks; various sized modular skate park systems; and indoor equipment. TotTurf concentrates on surfaces while Everlast Climbing Industries focus on youth fitness and Spectrum Products makes assisted-access lifts. PlayCore is owned by
   <company id="129400">
    Irving Place Capital
   </company>
   and the company's management.

   Since buying PlayCore in 2007, owner Irving Place Capital has made nine add-on acquisitions, including Ultra Play Systems (2008), Big Toys (2010), and DERO Bike Rack (2012). The bolt-on strategy has expanded PlayCore's core competencies far beyond playscapes and enabled the play structures maker to enter new niches of the market. For example, Big Toys makes eco-friendly commercial playground equipment, while and Spectrum Products (acquired in 2010), makers items used in the construction, operations, and maintenance of commercial swimming pools and spas.

   PlayCore in September 2012 acquired Minneapolis-based DERO Bike Rack, which designs, makes, and markets bicycle parking and transit products, including bike racks, lockers, shelters, and customer bike storage products. The acquisition coincides with a rise in popularity of biking as a commuter option. In July 2012, the company bought Colorado Time Systems, a maker of timing, scoring, and display systems for performance sports venues, including aquatic sports.

  <p>
   PlayCore's first incarnation, Newco, was formed in 1979 by engineer Thomas Baer. At first the company provided custom welding and fabrication services. In 1985 however, Baer went shopping for a wooden swing set for his daughter but balked at the $750 price tag. He then designed and built a set himself. Baer started selling his swing sets the following year. He added climbing units in 1989 and plastic slides in 1991. The following year the company went public as Swing-N-Slide. When sales stalled in 1994, the company retained Salomon Brothers to help engineer an upswing. That year Swing-N-Slide introduced its Tuff Kids commercial playground equipment.

  <p>
   To remain competitive, Swing-N-Slide continued to update its products. In 1996 the company began selling precut cedar playground kits for consumers and started making and selling Shape Plastics. That year sales fell when Swing-N-Slide lost 300 retail outlets to a competitor and when retailers reduced inventory. In 1997 Swing-N-Slide more than doubled in size when it purchased commercial playground equipment maker GameTime.

   Frederic Contino, a former Newell Companies executive, was named CEO in early 1998. The company then changed its name to PlayCore and bought Pentes Play, a maker of indoor equipment. PlayCore ventured away from swings in 1999 by purchasing Heartland Industries, a manufacturer of storage buildings.
