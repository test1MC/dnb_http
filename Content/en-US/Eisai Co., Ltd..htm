   Eisai develops, manufactures, and distributes prescription pharmaceuticals, primarily in North America and Japan. Prescription drug sales account for a majority of the company's revenues and are led by Aricept, which treats Alzheimer's disease. Other drugs include Pariet (known as AcipHex in the US), an acid reflux and ulcer treatment. Development programs target neurology, oncology, vascular, and immunological ailments. In addition, in Japan Eisai distributes over-the-counter drugs and consumer health products. The company also makes chemical active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).

  <p>
   The company's Pharmaceutical Business is organized into reporting segments Japan (prescription and generic drugs and diagnostics), Americas, Asia (excluding Japan), EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Oceania), and Consumer Healthcare Business -- Japan (primarily OTC drugs).
  </p>
  <p>
   Reducing its reliance on Aricept and Pariet, Eisai has recently launched four products: Halaven, a novel anticancer agent discovered in-house; Lenvima, another anticancer agent discovered and developed in-house; Fycompa, an antiepileptic agent; and BELVIQ, a treatment for adult obesity. Other products include antiemetic Aloxi and anticancer agent Treakisym/Symbenda. In a licensing agreement with AbbVie, the company launched Humira for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases. Eisai is also working on promoting Lyrica (for postherpetic neuralgia) and Lunesta (for insomnia).
  </p>

  <p>
   The company markets its products in North America, Europe (including Oceania), and Asia. It has production plants in Japan, the USA, the UK, China, and India; and laboratories in Japan, the US, and the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   Japan accounted for some 60% of Eisai's revenue in 2014.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Eisai has sales offices in North America, Europe, and Asia, including Japan. The company markets its products through a sales force which includes medical sales representatives and health care professionals. It also advertises directly to consumers on television and in magazines.
  </p>

  <p>
   In fiscal 2014 (ended March), revenue increased 5% to ¥600.4 billion on increased sales of Halaven, Humira, and Lyrica, as well as the epilepsy franchise products including Fycompa. Other segments also grew that year, and the divestiture of the development and marketing rights of DNA methylation inhibitor Dacogen 4 added to Eisai's earnings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has fallen for the past three years. It declined 32% to ¥33 billion due primarily to foreign exchange rates and restructuring costs. Cash flow from operations rose 17% to ¥86.7 billion in 2014.

  <p>
   The company is working to diversify, with efforts to broaden its product offerings and finding new uses for its existing portfolio. It is investing in launching and expanding its global brands and accelerating the creating of new products. Eisai is also working to expand its presence in geographic markets including Canada, Brazil, Mexico, and other Latin American nations. Other strategic markets are Russia, the Middle East, and Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Epilepsy is a relatively new area of focus for the company, which launched Fycompa, Inovelon/BANZEL, Zonegran, and Zebinix during the fiscal year ended March 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2013 the company launched obesity treatment BELVIQ in the US; it has the rights to market and distribute in several other markets around the world. Cancer drug Halaven has been launched in more than 30 countries in the EMEA region, and those launches are only going to continue further.
  </p>
  <p>
   To establish a stable supply chain in China, where the company expects demand for its injectables to rise, Eisai opened a new plant in Suzhou, Jiangsu, in 2014. It also built a new packaging facility in the UK in preparation for the launch of multiple new products there.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eisai continues to strike up new collaborative agreements with partners for the exploration of new treatments. In 2015 it signed a deal with
   <company id="58089">
    Merck
   </company>
   to evaluate the use of Merck's KEYTRUDA in combination with Eisai's oncology compounds LENVIMA and Halaven. Also that year it entered into an agreement with Nihon Medi-Physics to contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of dementia with Lewy bodies in Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to developing treatments for dementia, Eisai carries on educational activities to promote the early diagnosis and treatment of dementia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also doing some restructuring -- selling off certain holdings as it focuses on growth markets. In mid-2015 is agreed to spin off its gastrointestinal drug business; later that year, it announced plans to sell a unit that provides clinical diagnostic reagents to

  <p>
   To expand its presence in China's generics market, Eisai acquired Liaoning Tianyi Biological Pharmaceutical for some $78.2 million in late 2015. Renamed Eisai (Liaoning) Pharmaceutical, the acquired firm makes 20 generics products in China and is approved to make some 90 drugs; Eisai plans to use the firm to build its hospital supplier operations.
