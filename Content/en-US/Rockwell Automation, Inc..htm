   Rockwell Automation only rocks to the scintillating sounds of its control products. The company is one of the world's largest industrial automation companies, serving automotive, food and beverage (including dairy), personal care, life sciences, oil and gas, mining, and paper and pulp markets. Rockwell's control products &amp; solutions unit makes industrial automation products such as motor starters and contractors, relays, timers, signaling devices, and variable-speed drives. To complement its automation product offerings, its architecture &amp; software unit offers factory management software and motion control, sensors, and machine safety components.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company holds a solid global market share in process control technology, which includes PAC systems (programmable automation controller) that use sensors, computers, and software. Rockwell's branded PlantPAx Process Automation System competes effectively with the more traditional distributed control system (DCS), which are larger and more costly.
  </p>
  <p>
   Control products is the larger of Rockwell's two units, representing 55% of total sales. This segment manufactures intelligent motor and industrial control products under the ICS Triplex brand. The company's architecture &amp; software unit markets products such as hardware, software, and communication components needed to control industrial processes and communicate the results to the manufacturer. Brand names for this segment include Rockwell Software and FactoryTalk. Both segments market products and services under the Rockwell Automation, Allen-Bradley, and A-B brand names.

  <p>
   Rockwell has operations in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Mexico, Poland, Singapore, Switzerland, and the US.  Its control products segment is headquartered in Milwaukee, while architecture &amp; software is stationed in Mayfield Heights, Ohio.
  </p>
  <p>
   About 55% of its sales come from the US, but Rockwell also maintains a presence in the international markets of Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Mexico, and the UK.

  <p>
   Independent distributors account for about 70% of worldwide sales and 90% of sales in North America. The company also markets its products through a direct sales force.

   After posting record-setting revenues of $6.6 billion in 2014, Rockwell saw its revenues decline the last two years. Its most recent slide occurred in 2016, when revenues dipped 7% from $6.31 billion in 2015 to $6.88 billion in 2016. Rockwell's profits fell 12% from $828 million to $730 million during that same time period due to the lower revenue coupled with a slight bump in interest expenses. In addition, the company's operating cash flow declined from $1.19 billion in 2015 to $947 million in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue decline for 2016 was fueled by a 9% drop in control products sales and a 4% dip in architecture &amp; software sales. It was also affected by revenue declines in Canada (15%) and the regions of Latin America (10%) and Asia/Pacific (8). Organic sales decreased 4% in 2016, while currency translations reduced sales by 3%. Growth in consumer and automotive industries was also more than offset by declines in heavy industries, particularly the oil and gas and mining sector.

  <p>
   Leveraging strong growth in emerging markets, Rockwell has devised a strategy of globalizing by localizing, adapting products, services, and operations to be closer to customers. The company's long-term strategy for broader growth includes innovations to attract more industries to its customer base, increasing its partner network, acquisitions to obtain complementary technology and expand geographically. The strategy that includes these goals and others is intended to reach revenue growth of 6-8% and increase the percentage of sales outside the US to 60%.

  <p>
   Acquisitions are key to the company's growth. In late 2016, Rockwell acquired systems integrator
   <company id="106924">
    MAVERICK Technologies
   </company>
   . It made the deal in order to expand its own domain expertise for customers in industries such as chemical, food and beverage, and oil and gas. MAVERICK is located in Columbia, Illinois, and has roughly 20 locations in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 it also picked up Automation Control Products, a provider of centralized thin client, remote desktop, and server management software. The acquisition strengthened Rockwell's ability to provide customers with visual display and software platforms to manage information and streamline workflows for a more connected manufacturing environment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Months earlier, Rockwell snapped up MagneMotion, a manufacturer of intelligent conveying systems. The deal enabled the company to build a portfolio of smart manufacturing technologies by expanding its existing capabilities in independent cart technology.

  <p>
   Rockwell Automation is the legacy of two early-20th-century entrepreneurs: Willard Rockwell and Clement Melville Keys. Rockwell gained control in 1919 of Wisconsin Parts Company, an Oshkosh, Wisconsin, maker of automotive axles. He went on to buy a number of industrial manufacturers, merging them in 1953 to create Rockwell Spring &amp; Axle. Renamed Rockwell-Standard in 1958, it led the world in the production of mechanical automotive parts by 1967.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1928 Keys founded North American Aviation (NAA) as a holding company for his aviation interests.
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   bought NAA in 1934 and named James Kindelberger as its president. The company moved in 1935 from Maryland to Inglewood, California, where it built military training planes. NAA merged with Rockwell-Standard, creating North American Rockwell in 1967. The company adopted the Rockwell International name in 1973. It wasn't until the beginning of the new century when the company changed its name to Rockwell Automation.
