   Like "Wild Bill" of Wild West lore, Hickok is quite comfortable shooting it out with competitors on its own measured road to success. The company manufactures testing equipment used by automotive technicians to repair cars. Hickok also makes instruments, indicators, and gauges for manufacturers of aircraft and locomotives. While

   and
   <company id="10640">

   </company>
   traditionally were the company's largest customers, its biggest customer now is
   <company id="110456">
    Environmental Systems Products
   </company>
   (ESP), at 53% of sales. Hickok sells products primarily in the US. President and CEO Robert Bauman and the three daughters of founder Robert D. Hickok, including chairman Janet Slade, control the company.

   Robert D. Hickok founded Hickok Electrical Instrument in Atlanta in 1910 and moved it to Cleveland in 1913. The company introduced the first AC/DC radio tube tester in 1920 and began making electrical instrumentation for aircraft during the mid-1930s. In 1950, after his father's death, Robert D. Hickok Jr. took over the firm; he took it public in 1959. During the 1960s the company acquired a number of firms and Robert Bauman became chief engineer. In 1969 Robert D. Hickok Jr. retired. Hickok began its relationship with
   <company id="10597">
    Ford Motor
   </company>
   in 1981, moving into automotive diagnostic tools. Bauman became president in 1991 and later CEO (1992) and chairman (1993).
  </p>
  <p>
   To expand its product line, Hickok acquired Allen-Bradley Co. (fastening systems) in 1994. Hickok's name was changed to Hickok Incorporated the next year. Diversification efforts in 1996 included acquiring Maradyne's Beacon Gage Division (railroad and transit car pressure gauges). Sales and earnings suffered in 1997 when Ford and
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   delayed purchasing automotive diagnostic and fastening systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Transitioning to the aftermarket business, Hickok bought automotive diagnostic and specialty toolmaker Waekon Industries (renamed Waekon Corp.) in 1998. The acquisition fit into the company's long-term plan to decrease its dependence on a few large, occasional orders from carmakers and to increase its presence in the more stable automotive aftermarket. Hickok recorded a loss in fiscal 1999, in part because of its change to a lower-margin product mix.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Hickok closed its Kirkwood, Pennsylvania, plant and moved production to the firm's Greenwood, Mississippi, factory to reduce costs. The company's line of DIGILOG aircraft instruments was approved by the
   <company id="103845">
    FAA
   </company>
   in fiscal 2002; since that time, other models, which had potential in the aircraft retrofit market, also were certified.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hickock unsuccessfully attempted to buy out enough of its outstanding shares to enable it to go private in 2004. The company's intention to end its obligations for
   <company id="56705">
    SEC
   </company>
   registration was to eliminate expenses related to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and to focus on its operations.
