  <p>
   Brooks Automation operates in two segments. The semiconductor unit supplies 81% of the company's revenue. It makes a range of equipment critical for the manufacture of semiconductor production machines. Brooks Automation semiconductor products include atmospheric and vacuum tool automation systems, atmospheric and vacuum robots and robotic modules, thermal management products, and cryogenic pumping assemblies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's life sciences segment, 19% of revenue, was formed from acquisitions it made several years ago. The unit's products include sample storage management systems, blood fractionation equipment, sample preparation and handling equipment, parts, consumables, and support services for the biotechnology, laboratory, pharmaceutical, and research industry sectors.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Brooks operates manufacturing plants in the US (California, Colorado, and Massachusetts), as well as in China, Germany, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   Customers in Asia account for 44% of revenue, followed by US customers with 37%, and European customers with 19%.

  <p>
   The company sells its products and services in North America, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East through a direct sales force. Sales in Japan are made through Yaskawa Brooks Automation, a joint venture with
   <company id="54217">
    Yaskawa Electric Corporation
   </company>
   . Its sales cycle is lengthy (up to 18 months) and generally involves several employees from sales, marketing, engineering, and senior management.

   With 80% of its revenue coming from the semiconductor industry, Brooks Automation is subject to the industry's ups and downs. Revenue inched up 1% in 2016 (ended September) to $560 million from $552 million in 2015. The life sciences segment injected a bit of life in the 2016 revenue, rising about 60% from 2015's level. The acquisition of BioStorage in 2016 added about $45 million in revenue. Without that additional revenue, life science revenue would have dropped for the year. The semiconductor unit's sales dropped 7%. The company posted higher revenue in nearly all geographic regions. In Europe, however, sales fell 26% in 2016 from 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Brooks Automation's bottom line plunged to a $69 million loss in 2016 from a $14 million profit in 2015. The loss was the result of sluggish revenue growth combined with higher expenses and restructuring charges.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations dipped to $39 million in 2016 from about $44 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Brooks plans to focus on applying its controlled temperature and pressure technologies to sectors outside the notoriously cyclical semiconductor industry. Though 80% of sales continue to come from the semiconductor market, the company's technologies are being increasingly used in the data storage, flat panel display, medical, industrial instruments, and solar markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company began to restructure the semiconductor group, consolidating its Jena, Germany repair facility into its Chelmsford, Massachusetts operation to reduce the company's global footprint and streamline costs. Severance costs related to a reduction in headcount were $1.8 million, which were recognized in 2016 (ended September). Brooks expects pre-tax savings of $1.6 million a year.
  </p>
  <p>
   To build beyond semiconductors, the company has created, through acquisitions, a life sciences business where its automation expertise can be applied.

  <p>
   With the acquisition of BioStorage Technologies, Brooks gained a global provider of comprehensive sample management and integrated cold chain solutions for biosciences applications. BioStorage complements Brooks' offerings and provides additional products that open the company to a larger market. The deal also expands its reach in China. The acquisition cost about $130 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In another 2016 acquisition, also in the biosciences, Brooks bought Cool Lab, a subsidiary of BioCision. Cool Lab's products are used for storing and transporting sensitive materials.

   Norman Brooks founded Brooks Associates in 1978 to develop semiconductor automation equipment. Its vacuum transfer innovations set new standards for the industry. After the firm was sold to the Aeronca Electronics unit of Fleet Aerospace (now
   <company id="58138">
    Magellan Aerospace
   </company>
   ) in 1985, Brooks served as its VP and general manager. In 1989 Brooks, chip testing equipment executive Robert Therrien, and several members of the Brooks management team repurchased the operation. As CEO of the new Brooks Automation, Therrien moved the company away from batch processing toward one-at-a-time wafer handling technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Brooks went public in 1995. The following year it bought Canadian equipment control products maker Techware Systems. In 1998 the company acquired factory automation software company FASTech Integration and won a software contract from
   <company id="41888">
    Toshiba
   </company>
   . Norman Brooks died in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company continued its buying binge with purchases that included robotics firm Smart Machines and
   <company id="56468">
    Jenoptik
   </company>
   's Germany-based Infab division (factory interface systems). In 1999 the company formed a joint venture with
   <company id="55277">
    Samsung Electronics
   </company>
   to develop FPD manufacturing equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Brooks acquired automation software companies AutoSimulations and Auto-Soft from
   <company id="56631">
    Daifuku
   </company>
   America in 2000. Later that year the company purchased Irvine Optical Company, a wafer handling and sorting technology specialist, in a $30 million deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company continued its acquisition strategy in 2001 when it bought Progressive Technologies ($31 million, precision air flow and pressure control systems), General Precision Inc. ($27 million, fab mini-environments), and Switzerland-based Tec-Sem ($20 million, photolithography tool buffers and batch transfer systems). The company resold Tec-Sem to a group led by the unit's management in 2003. Also in 2001 Brooks announced plans to acquire archrival
   <company id="42201">
    PRI Automation
   </company>
   in a deal initially valued at $380 million. By the time the deal closed in 2002, Brooks' heightened stock price meant that the deal was worth more than $530 million. Around that time Brooks bought
   <company id="15204">
    Zygo
   </company>
   's Automation Systems Group, which made sorters, handlers, and inspection systems for wafer reticles, for $11 million in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   Brooks acquired Intelligent Automation Systems (custom automation products) in 2002 for about $18 million. Later that year the company completed its purchase of PRI and changed its name to Brooks-PRI Automation. It picked up Germany-based Hermos Informatik from Hermos Group that same year for about $40 million; Hermos Informatik made radio-frequency identification (RFID) equipment that tracked semiconductor wafers during processing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The year 2003 saw the company change its name back to Brooks Automation. The next year COO Edward Grady succeeded Therrien as CEO; Therrien remained chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   Brooks sold the assets of its Specialty Equipment and Life Sciences division, formerly Intelligent Automation Systems (IAS), in 2005. Later that year Brooks acquired vacuum systems maker
   <company id="13669">
    Helix Technology
   </company>
   in a stock-swap transaction valued at $454 million. With the purchase, the former shareholders of Helix owned about 39% of Brooks.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2006 Brooks acquired
   <company id="132733">
    Synetics Solutions
   </company>
   from
   <company id="54217">
    Yaskawa Electric
   </company>
   and formed a 50/50 joint venture in Japan with Yaskawa, called Yaskawa Brooks Automation (YBA). It began 2007 with the sale of its Brooks Software division to Applied Materials for $125 million in cash. Brooks Software once provided one-eighth of Brooks Automation's sales. The company saw the sale as a way to focus on its core semiconductor-related hardware businesses. The Antitrust Division of the
   <company id="150279">
    US Department of Justice
   </company>
   requested more information from Applied and Brooks on the software transaction, temporarily delaying the closing of the deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   The SEC initiated an informal inquiry into company practices on the timing and purchasing of stock-option grants in 2006. Brooks warned investors not to rely on audited financial results from fiscal 1999 through fiscal 2005, restating those results to more accurately reflect the financial impact of option grants. Directors Roger Emerick and Amin Khoury voluntarily resigned from the board in 2006 and made a point of renouncing their stock options and restricted stock awards, vested and unvested, to avoid any appearance of impropriety. Both had served on the board for more than a decade, prior to Brooks Automation's 1995 IPO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Co-founder Robert Therrien stepped down as chairman and left the board in early 2006. He was indicted for federal income tax evasion in mid-2007. The SEC also brought civil charges against him for alleged violations of federal securities laws. Brooks said it was cooperating with both federal prosecutors and the SEC in the case, which was not expected to result in any charges against the company. Joseph Martin, a long-time director of the company and the former vice chairman of
   <company id="53008">
    Fairchild Semiconductor
   </company>
   , succeeded Therrien as chairman. CEO Edward Grady retired in 2007, and the company tapped director Robert Lepofsky -- an older man than Grady -- to succeed him. Lepofsky served on the Brooks board since 2005, when the company acquired Helix Technology, where he once was the chairman and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Brooks faced the
   <company id="56705">
    Securities and Exchange Commission
   </company>
   (SEC) in 2006 when the commission launched an informal inquiry into the company's practices on the timing and purchasing of stock-option grants. In 2008 the SEC alleged that Brooks had overstated income and understated employee compensation expenses by $64.5 million, failing to properly account for employee stock options between 1996 and 2005. Without admitting or denying the charges, Brooks agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against violations of federal securities laws. No civil penalty was assessed. The company noted that it was not charged with fraud, nor were any money damages involved. Brooks joined a host of other publicly held firms in cleaning up corporate policies on when executives and board members may date and exercise their stock options.
