   Having earned a 20% market share, BISSELL Homecare has become one of the top floor-care companies in North America. The floor-care firm has achieved this by concentrating on innovation and by boosting its factory staff with engineers, market researchers, data analysts, and industrial designers. The company's practice of hiring new college graduates alongside advanced-degree professionals has allowed the appliance maker to arm itself with fresh ideas and lessons learned. As a result, it has pulled ahead of rival brands the likes of

   BISSELL works to stay at the forefront of the home appliances market by rolling out new products and making add-on acquisitions. Launched in 2014, the BISSELL Symphony All-in-One Vacuum and Steam Mop is the company's latest invention to debut on Home Shopping Network. It also launched its Healthy Home Vacuum and ProHeat 2X Healthy Home deep cleaner. BISSELL Homecare touts the vacuum line as locking in 100% of captured allergens and the deep cleaner as removing two times more embedded allergens than ordinary vacuuming alone. BISSELL Homecare's acquisition of the Woolite rug and upholstery cleaning unit of
