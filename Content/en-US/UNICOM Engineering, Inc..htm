  <p>
   UNICOM Engineering's strategy for continued growth hinges on the combination of products with support services encompassing functions such as integration control, platform management, global logistics, and support and maintenance after the sale. The company sees this focus on a comprehensive offering as its competitive advantage, providing a lower total cost of ownership to customers, thereby helping the company strengthen existing client relationships and win new ones. Consequently, NEI works not only on developing technologies that advance its products' functionality and deployment, but also on creating services that help it provide an improved time to market and total cost of ownership.
