   While it typically heavily on R&amp;D $32 million in 2015), Tessera also supports a sizable budget for litigation expenses, which cost around $14 million in 2015, down from $25 million in 2014. The reduced litigation spending was due to settlements reached in 2014 and early 2015.

   Tessera has gotten its business on a more stable footing with the settlement of several lawsuits, which should produce regularly recurring revenue, and the signing of new licensing deals.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2015, Tessera reached a settlement with Amkor, in which Amkor agreed to pay a total of $155 million of 16 quarterly payments through the fourth quarter of 2018. The company signed new license agreements with Samsung and Micron that resulted in significant revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company closed the last manufacturing operation of its DigitalOptics business. More than 300 workers were let go and facilities in California, New York, Taiwan, and Japan were closed.

  <p>
   The company's acquisition strategy is focused on buy companies that strengthen its position in various markets, largely focused on imaging. In 2015 Tessera bought Ziptronix. The $39 million deal expanded Tessera's advanced packaging capabilities by adding a low-temperature wafer bonding technology platform that help it get newer technologies to its semiconductor industry customers.

  <p>
   In 2014 the FotoNation subsidiary bought Smart Sensors Limited, which develops iris recognition biometric technology.
