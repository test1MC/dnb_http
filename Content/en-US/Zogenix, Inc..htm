   Zogenix wants to help the pain go away faster. The pharmaceutical company is developing and commercializing central nervous system (CNS) and therapeutic pain medications. Zohydro ER, its second marketed product (launched in 2014), is an extended-release oral formulation of hydrocodone without acetaminophen for daily pain management. Other drugs under development include Relday, an injectable form of risperidone to treat schizophrenia and bipolar symptoms. Zogenix's first marketed product, Sumavel DosePro, which combined the company's DosePro needle-free drug delivery technology with migraine drug sumatriptan, was sold in 2014.

  <p>
   Zogenix's DosePro's pre-filled needle-free drug delivery system uses nitrogen gas to inject compounds into the fatty subcutaneous region under the skin. While the technology was first harnessed to carry sumatriptan, an already-approved  migraine drug, the company also intends to develop DosePro as a delivery system for other injectable drugs. It is seeking alliances with other companies with already approved drugs, and considering using existing off-patent drugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Zohydro ER uses an oral absorption technology licensed from
   <company id="47964">
    Elan Corporation
   </company>
   , now part of
   <company id="162547">
    Alkermes
   </company>
   . The drug is an extended-release version of the opiod hydrocodone, but, unlike existing versions of that drug, it does not have other anti-inflammatory analgesics added.

   The company has a sales and marketing organization that markets its products to distributors, who then sell to pharmacies, hospitals, and other end users.
   <company id="10977">
    McKesson
   </company>
   and
   <company id="12894">
    Cardinal Health
   </company>
   together account for about 60% of product sales (which in 2013 just included Sumavel DosePro);
   <company id="40016">
    AmerisourceBergen
   </company>
   contributes about 15% of sales, as does
   <company id="10984">
    CVS.com
   </company>
   , which buys products directly from Zogenix.

  <p>
   Zogenix reported revenue of $33 million in 2013, down 25% from the prior year as contract revenue dried up upon the termination in 2012 of a co-promotion agreement with
   <company id="138741">
    Astellas
   </company>
   . In addition to the lack of contract revenue, product revenue in 2013 was negatively impacted by decreases in unit volume and average net selling price.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has reported net losses since its inception and anticipates continued losses for at least another year. To date, it has a deficit of $410 million.

  <p>
   In 2014 Zogenix sold its Sumavel DosePro product line to
   <company id="100352">
    Endo International
   </company>
   for $85 million in cash and up to $20 million in milestone payments. The divestiture allows the company to focus on the launch of Zohydro ER and other drugs in development.
