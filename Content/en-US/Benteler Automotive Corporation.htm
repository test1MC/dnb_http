   The company operates under the Automotive division of its parent company. This division contributed about 79% of its parent's total revenue in 2012. The segment also increased its revenues by 6% from 2011 to 2012 due to growth in Asia, especially in Japan as the country fully recovered from the impact of the earthquake and tsunami from the spring of fiscal 2011.

   Automotive production also continued to gain ground in China and India as production volume grew 6% in China, to 18.4 million vehicles, and 5% in India, to 3.8 million in 2012. This region accounted for some 50% of world production, and China alone represented 23%.
