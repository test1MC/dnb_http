   Tonnellerie François Frères (TTF) crafts vessels that contain the fruit of the vine, but it doesn't suggest that you drink directly from them. TTF has four core businesses: stave milling, cooperage, cask manufacturing and oak wine-aging products. It also offers oak products for oenology, where the wine is put in contact with wood in varied forms, and has developed products for the alcohol maturing and aging market, especially the whisky market. The company offers four brands of barrels: Exclusif, Privilege, Classique and Horizon. It manages more than 40 entities and their 30 or more specific and complementary brands.

   The company's revenues increased by 6% in 2014 due to a 0.9% growth in the wine business and a 32.1% growth in the whisky business. The growth in activity in the wine market has been limited by a small French harvest while the American market has seen its third consecutive year of double-digit growth. Other parts of the world saw large fluctuations in the wine market, whereas its Scotland-based whisky business continued to grow due to its rising popularity.
