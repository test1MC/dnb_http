   Lumenis sheds new light on skin problems. The firm makes medical devices that use intense pulsed light (IPL), lasers, and radiofrequency technology to treat aesthetic problems (lesions, wrinkles, acne, etc.) and a wide range of other conditions. Its proprietary IPL technology converts the light source into thermal energy. Aesthetic systems include LightSheer to remove hair and rejuvenate skin and M-22 used to treat fine lines, wrinkles, scars, and discoloration. The UltraPulse and VersaPulse systems are used for urology, neurology, and ENT (ear, nose, and throat) surgical procedures. The firm also makes ophthalmic laser products for vision correction. Lumenis was acquired by XIO Group for $510 million in 2015.

  <p>
   Lumenis went public in early 2014; it raised $100 million in its IPO and has used the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including developing new products and for possible future acquisitions. The following year Lumenis agreed to be acquired by Chinese investment fund XIO Group. The purchase price of $510 million includes a 20% premium on the IPO price.

  <p>
   Though the company touts its surgical systems, historically, the aesthetics segment has brought in the highest percentage of revenue. But surgical took over by a slim margin in 2013 due to higher sales of equipment especially in the US and Asia. Ophthalmic continues to trail especially since the patent on one of the company's machines expired in mid-2013.

  <p>
   In addition to earning money from sales of its IPL, laser, and other machines, Lumenis also collects revenue from warranty and maintenance services.

   The company headquarters is in Israel and it has subsidiaries in the US, Hong Kong, China, Australia, Japan, Brazil, Singapore, Italy, Germany, the UK, France and the Netherlands.

  <p>
   The company uses direct sales representatives and distribution partners to market its products, which are sold to a variety of health care providers including hospitals, surgery centers, walk-in clinics, and general and specialist physicians in more than 100 countries. Lumenis works to expand its offerings by researching and developing new products, as well as improved versions of existing products.

  <p>
   Lumenis reported a 7% revenue increase for 2013 due to higher sales of products in surgical and aesthetics offset by a dip in ophthalmic due to a patent expiration mid-year. Profit increased about 15% while net income and cash flow both rose despite the company's investments in equipment, facilities, and going public.

  <p>
   The company plans to continue to pursue geographic expansion, particularly in China. Though the country represents a large portion of sales, Lumenis believes it has plenty of room to grow there. Other plans include developing new products and moving into additional treatment areas including gastroenterology, neurology, gynecology, pulmonology, and oncology.
