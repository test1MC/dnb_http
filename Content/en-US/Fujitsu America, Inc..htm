   Fujitsu has room to grow in the Americas, a geographic region that contributes just 8% of parent Fujitsu Limited's revenue. Fujitsu Limited has flattened and broadened its reporting structure to help stimulate greater international sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the Americas, Fujitsu focuses on providing products and services for vertical markets, consulting and systems integration services, applications, infrastructure and customer services, enterprise systems and customer systems. In particular, it has targeted health care and the government sector, looking to capitalize on increased government spending in each. Other areas of emphasis are law enforcement and retail.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fujitsu America has also expanded its products and services that tackle implementation of cloud computing services as more and more businesses embrace that model for managing their IT assets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fujitsu maintains research and development operations in California, Texas and North Carolina. It also runs data centers in those states as well as in Saskatchewan and Trinidad.
