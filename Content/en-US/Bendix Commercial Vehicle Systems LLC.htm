   The company has launched Bendix Wingman Active Cruise with Braking (ACB) to help drivers avoid collisions through a radar sensor mounted to the front of the vehicle. With cruise control on and speed set, ACB warns and intervenes to maintain proper following distance by reducing the throttle. Bendix Pneumatic Booster System (PBS), an air management system to improve fuel economy and reduce engine emissions, was also introduced. Additionally, the company launched its Bendix Brake Training School for new and experienced technicians.
