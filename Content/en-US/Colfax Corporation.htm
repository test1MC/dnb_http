   Colfax makes fluid handling products, including centrifugal, gear, progressive cavity, and rotary screw pumps under such brands as Allweiler, Imo, and Total Lubrication Management. Colfax also makes valves and lubrication systems and products and equipment used in the cutting and joinging of steels and metals. Its products are used in cargo handling, oil transport, firefighting, chemical processing, and pipeline applications. Colfax has counted such big names as

  <p>
   Colfax operates through more than 15 production facilities in the US and roughly 75 more in 26 countries across Australia, Europe, Americas, South Africa, and Asia. Revenues outside of the US account for around 75% of its net sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Colfax divides its operations across two business segments. Fabrication Technology (50% of sales) makes products and equipment used in the process of cutting and combining steels, aluminum, and other metals and metal alloys. Gas and Fluid Handling (50%) is responsible for Colfax's pumping and fluid-handing operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   To drive its multiple business units, Colfax essentially acts as a centralized support system, allowing each business to act independently and market its respective products directly. Imo Pumps, for example, markets pumps used in chemical processing, marine, and power generation machinery, while Portland Valve is a major contractor for the US Navy, supplying valves, actuators, and other components used on naval vessels.
  </p>
  <p>
   Across the Atlantic, Allweiler is Germany's oldest pump maker with 140 years of experience. Its Netherlands-based Houttuin provides low-pressure pumps to the petrochemical, power, shipbuilding, food, beverage, and plastics industries, and, like its US counterpart, Imo AB offers three-screw pumps for non-corrosive chemicals and lubricants.

  <p>
   Colfax sells through a global sales and marketing network, and through distributors in around 100 countries. The company's customer base includes commercial, industrial, and government customers. In 2015 about 45% of its net sales were shipped to locations in emerging markets.
  </p>

  <p>
   After posting record-setting revenues of $4.6 billion in 2014, Colfax saw its revenues fall 14% to nearly $4 billion in 2015. Revenue from Gas and Fluid Handling decreased primarily due to declines in the power generation, mining, and general industrial markets. Fabrication Technology sales also decreased due to a dip in equipment sales and consumable volumes across most regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its profits plummeted 57% from $392 million in 2014 to $168 million in 2015 mainly due to an absence of benefit from income taxes it experienced the previous year. Colfax's operating cash flow has steadily risen over the last few years; however, it fell 21% from 2014 to 2015.

  <p>
   The company's strategy for growth focuses on a number of core strengths, including the brand-name recognition held by its multiple businesses, its end-market and geographic diversification, and Colfax's custom engineering capacity and liquidity to pursue promising acquisition opportunities.
  </p>
  <p>
   The need for power generating facilities in Asia and the Middle East may prove to be a boon for Colfax. Its fluid handling products can be found in fuel, hydro, and nuclear power plants. The aftermarket sales and service sector is another area of potential growth for the company. An aging global maritime fleet will increase the need for maintenance, repair and overhaul operations on ocean-going vessels.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mergers and Acquisitions
  </p>
  <p>
   The company traditionally acquires companies with an established marketplace presence. In 2015 it purchased Simsmart Technologies for $15 million. Simsmart provides a software that controls ventilation conditions and increases fan efficiency. The acquisition expanded Colfax's Howden product portfolio primarily within the mining end market and other end markets facing challenging ventilation conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2015, Colfax bought RootsTM for a cash consideration of $181 million. Roots is a supplier of blower and compressor technologies which service a broad range of end markets, including wastewater treatment, chemical production, and power generation. The acquisition enhanced Colfax's compressors and blowers product portfolio and added notable application expertise.
  </p>
  <p>
   Colfax completed a major acquisition in 2014 with the purchase of
   <company id="41606">
    Victor Technologies Holdings
   </company>
   (Victor) from
   <company id="129400">
    Irving Place Capital
   </company>
   for a total sum of $947 million. Victor is a global manufacturer of cutting, gas control, and specialty welding equipment with a strong global product portfolio. The deal added significantly to Colfax's Fabrication Technology segment.
