  <p>
   Sasol Chemicals (USA) traces its origins to
   <company id="53892">
    ConocoPhillips
   </company>
   ' chemicals unit, which was spun off as a private company (Vista Chemical) in 1984. It went public two years later, was purchased by
   <company id="93289">
    RWE
   </company>
   in 1991, and was sold to Sasol in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Sasol Chemicals (USA) selected Univation Technologies, UNIPOL PE Process for its petrochemical project in Lake Charles. The new  polyethylene plant will be capable of producing a broad product portfolio including metallocene polyethylene. Parent Sasol has a long-standing relationship with Univation, which has worked with the company in developing a similar plant in South Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   Responding to the growth in the North American shale gas liquids market (and subsequent expansion of available ethane), in 2011 Sasol began a feasibility study for a major ethylene cracker and derivatives complex at Sasol North America's complex in Southwest Louisiana. The cracker unit could produce between 1 million tons and 1.4 million tons of ethylene per year and would cost between $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion to build.
