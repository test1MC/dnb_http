   Sequans offers two lines of products for LTE networks. The feature-loaded StreamrichLTE line is used in mobile computing and home and mobile. The the lower-cost StreamliteLTE line is for multiple deployments such as in machine-to-machine devices and the Internet of Things. The company is phasing out its line of WiMax chips.
  </p>
  <p>
   Products generate 76% of revenue with licensing and services bring in the rest.

   Sequans does a lot of business in Asia. That's where its chips are made and assembled and that's where most of its customers are. Customers in Asia account for 77% of the company's revenue with the Americas and Europe splitting the remaining revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is based in Colombes, France and it has research and development operations in the UK, Israel, and the US.

   The company's Top 10 customers accounted for more than 90% of revenue in 2015, a percentage that has declined over the past three years. Among those customers are Asian Information Technology Inc. (16% of sales in 2015),

  <p>
   In 2015 Sequans' revenue sparkled, rising 44% to $32.5 million from $22.6 million in 2014. Higher sales of LTE products were driven by customers selling to emerging markets and those selling to the US. The product mix also included devices with higher average selling prices. Licensing and services revenue rose as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the big revenue gain, Sequans lost money in 2015. But at $27.4 million the 2015 loss was about $6 million less than the 2014 loss. The company had a major expense in paying out marketing incentives related to a 2015 initiative.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's negative cash flow fell to $16.4 million in 2015 from $24 million in 2014.

  <p>
   While whisperings of 5G technology is in the air, Sequans thinks that 4G will be around for a while. Part of the market it sees is for the billions of wireless devices that connected together will comprise the Internet of Things. The company expects its low-power LTE chips, such at the Calliope introduced in 2015,  to be major competitors for that market.
