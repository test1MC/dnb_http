   The grass certainly seems greener at Scotts Miracle-Gro, one of the world's largest makers and marketers of horticultural and turf products. It serves consumer lawn and garden and pest control markets. Its garden and indoor plant care items include grass seeds, fertilizers, herbicides, potting soils, and tools. Some of Scotts Miracle-Gro's brands (Ortho, Miracle-Gro, Scotts, and Turf Builder) are household names, and it also markets

   's Roundup herbicide. In order to focus on its core consumer business, in 2016 the company sold its Scotts LawnService segment (which offered lawn, tree, and shrub care services) to

        <p>
   The company operates via three segments: US Consumer, Europe Consumer, and Other.
  </p>
        <p>
   US Consumer (77% of revenues), consists of Scotts Miracle-Gro's consumer lawn and garden business in the US.
  </p>
        <p>
   Europe Consumer (13%), consists of the company's Europe-based consumer lawn and garden business.
  </p>
        <p>
   Other (10%) consists of consumer lawn and garden businesses in other geographies.

        <p>
   Scotts Miracle-Gro has headquarters in Marysville, Ohio and Ecully, France. It has a presence across the globe, including in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia.
  </p>
        <p>
   The US accounts for 82% of total net sales.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company sells to home centers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, large hardware chains, independent hardware stores, nurseries, garden centers and food and drug stores via a direct sales force and though a network of brokers and distributors.
  </p>
        <p>
   Advertising expenses were $132.2 million in fiscal 2016 (September year end), $133.2 million in fiscal 2015 and $132.1 million in fiscal 2014.

    Lowe's
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   . Because of its reliance on a small number of key businesses, the company focuses heavily on its relationships with these retailers.

        <p>
   In fiscal 2016, Scotts Miracle-Gro's net sales decreased by 6% to $2.84 billion. It secured higher revenues from acquisitions and higher sales volume within the Other segment; the impact of an amended marketing agreement for consumer Roundup; and the favorable impact of higher pricing in the US Consumer segment. These gains were more than offset by a number of factors, including the prior year sale of the UK Solus business resulting in a drop in net sales of $18.1 million in the Europe Consumer segment; and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates as a result of the strengthening of the US dollar relative to other currencies.
  </p>
        <p>
   Net income jumped 93.7% in fiscal 2016 to $315.3 million, driven by impairment, restructuring, and other recoveries (as compared to charges during fiscal 2015), and an increase in net sales, gross profit rate and equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates. These were partially offset by higher interest expense, costs related to refinancing, and selling, general, and administrative costs.
  </p>
        <p>
   Cash provided by operating activities totaled $237.4 million for fiscal 2016, down $9.5 million on the previous year. Cash provided from Scotts LawnService was $26.8 million and $28.2 million for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. The change was driven by an increase in cash used for working capital related to increased inventory, timing of customer receipts as compared to payment of current liabilities and an increase in accounts receivable from the TruGreen Joint Venture of $14.9 million. These gains were partially offset by insurance reimbursement recoveries of $40.9 million related to a consumer complaint legal matter.

        <p>
   Growth is more than just what Scotts Miracle-Gro provides for its customers' plants. The company's business strategy in recent years has been to develop fewer but more significant brands to efficiently drive its own growth. To accomplish this, it has made strategic divestments and leans heavily on organic economic growth for its primary segment.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2016 Scotts Miracle-Gro sold Scotts LawnService to a
   <company id="122884">
    TruGreen
   </company>
   , an entity controlled by private equity firm
   <company id="40093">
    Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice
   </company>
   . The combination of the two businesses created a lawn service business with 2.3 million customers and $1.3 billion in revenues. Scotts LawnService had grown -- through both acquisitions and internal growth -- from $42 million in sales in 2001 to some $288.5 million in 2015. The #2 lawn care services company in the US (after TruGreen), it had some 88 company-operated locations and 94 locations operated by independent franchisees, before it was sold to the latter company in 2016.
  </p>
        <p>
   In fiscal 2014, the company sold its US and Canadian wild bird food business.
  </p>
        <p>
   Scotts Miracle-Gro invests heavily in its brands, both in the US and abroad. It also intends to become more consumer focused, which involves growing its lawn and garden products. The company wants to drive growth by improving customer relations and providing the customer with better products and service. To improve business at the local level, the company established regional offices throughout the US.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's strategy is focused on growing its core branded business, primarily in the US, expanding its reach into new categories and geographies, and also reinventing the lawn and garden experience through improved marketing outreach and consumer engagement.
  </p>
        <p>
   It also invests in its research and development to improvise on its products, manufacturing processes, packaging, and delivery systems.
  </p>
        <p>
   Scotts Miracle-Gro sees acquisitions as an important element of its long term strategy.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In December 2016, the company acquired two technology companies include Blossom, maker of smart water controllers, and PlantLink, which includes soil sensors and a smart water valve system. The deals allows Scotts Miracle-Gro to expand its connected yard and smart water services to incorporate indoor as well as outdoor spaces.
  </p>
        <p>
   In May 2016, through its wholly-owned subsidiary The Hawthorne Gardening Company, the company acquired 75% of Gavita for $136.2 million. The move gives Scotts Miracle-Gro a presence in the lighting category of indoor and urban gardening.
  </p>
        <p>
   Prior to its sale, in fiscal 2015, Scotts LawnService bulked up its portfolio with a number of acquisitions, including General Hydroponics, Inc. and Bio-Organic Solutions, Inc., and Action Pest Control Inc.

   Founded by Orlando Scott in Marysville, Ohio, in 1868 as O.M. Scott &amp; Sons, the firm originally cleaned crop seed. It later began selling grass seed, and in 1928 debuted the US's first lawn fertilizer, Turf Builder. The family-owned business became a subsidiary of conglomerate ITT in 1971; it broke away in a 1986 management-led LBO. It went public as The Scotts Company in 1992.
  </p>
        <p>
   Acquisitions include Hyponex (1988), lawn and garden equipment maker Republic Tool and Manufacturing (1992), and specialty fertilizer maker Grace-Sierra Horticultural Products (1993). In 1995 Scotts merged with Stern's Miracle-Gro, a company that Horace Hagedorn had started in 1951; the deal married the #1 lawn care company with the #1 garden plant food firm. The company simplified its product line by cutting more than 300 products in 1996.
  </p>
        <p>
   Scotts launched an acquisition program in 1997 to increase sales in Europe. That year Scotts acquired the UK's Levington Horticulture (fertilizers and pesticides) and 80% of Sanford Scientific (genetically engineered grasses and plants). The next year Scotts landed a deal to market
   <company id="100932">
    Monsanto
   </company>
   's Roundup herbicide products internationally and bought two European lawn and garden product firms -- ASEF and Rhone-Poulenc Jardin (#1 in Europe). International sales jumped almost 75% for the year. In 1999 Scotts bought Monsanto's lawn and garden businesses (including its Ortho line) for $300 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2000 Scotts bought the distribution rights for peat products manufactured by Bord na Mona, one of Europe's largest peat producers. It also sold its US and Canadian professional turf operations to The Andersons, Inc. The same year Scotts acquired
   <company id="41028">
    Henkel
   </company>
   's European fertilizer and plant care brand, Substral. Due to sluggish growth, Scotts reorganized its European operations in 2002, pledging an investment of about $50 million by 2005. The company took a $9 million charge as a result in 2003.
  </p>
        <p>
   President and COO James Hagedorn was named CEO in 2001; James, Horace's son, retained the title of president. He assumed the additional role of chairman in 2003. The following year Scott's ventured into the gardening retail market with the acquisition of
   <company id="59476">
    Smith &amp; Hawken
   </company>
   . In the fall of 2004 Scotts paid $72 million for the high-end gardening retail chain.
  </p>
        <p>
   Horace Hagedorn died in early 2005. The Scotts Company changed its name to The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company that same year.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company closed its home and garden retail business
   <company id="59476">
    Smith &amp; Hawken

   at the end of 2009, a casualty of the troubled economy. It sold the Smith &amp; Hawken brand to mega-retailer

   In late 2010, fertilizer and specialty chemicals company
   <company id="107109">
    ICL
   </company>
   (Israel Chemicals Ltd.) acquired the company's business segment Global Professional, which sold products directly to landscape professionals (nurseries, greenhouses, and specialty crop growers). The $255 million sale allowed Scotts Miracle-Grow to pay down its debt and focus on its consumer products business.
  </p>
        <p>
   After experiencing several years of solid performances, Scotts Miracle-Gro suffered a loss in 2011, driven by bad weather in the US that interrupted peak sales seasons, weakness from the mass merchant sales channel, and higher than planned promotion costs. Its revenues of $2.8 billion were down almost 10% from the previous year, and it's net income of $167.9 million was down almost 18% from a 33% gain in 2010.
  </p>
        <p>
   Outside of the US, however, the company performed well in 2011, with 7% growth resulting from improvements in Canada and throughout Europe. The Scotts LawnService segment also reported a growth in sales of 5% that year.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 it increased its investment in marketing and advertising by as much as $40 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   As a result of slimming down its operations, Scotts Miraco-Gro began operating in 2011 with only two reportable segments: Global Consumer and Scotts LawnService. It completed the sale of its Global Professional segment in 2011 and began phasing out its professional seed business in the US.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2014 Scotts Miracle-Gro's indirect subsidiary, Scotts Canada acquired Fafard and Brothers, a leader in the production of high-quality peat moss and high-performance growing media products, including peat-based and bark-based mixes, composts and premium soils.
