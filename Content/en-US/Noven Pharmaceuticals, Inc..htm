   Noven Pharmaceuticals makes it easier to get drugs under your skin. Through its Noven Transdermals unit, the company develops drugs using its transdermal drug delivery system, which administers medication through a patch attached to the skin. Noven's patches include such female hormone replacement therapies as Minivelle and CombiPatch, as well as ADHD drug Daytrana. The company also produces and markets several non-transdermal psychiatric drugs through its Noven Therapeutics division. Noven is a subsidiary of Japanese drugmaker

   Noven serves as parent company
   <company id="162151">
    Hisamitsu
   </company>
   's growth platform in the US market, and the parent organization is working to strengthen Noven's R&amp;D, technology, manufacturing, and sales resources. It is also promoting the usage of Noven's transdermal drug delivery technology for other indications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Noven largely works to extend its product lines through internal R&amp;D efforts, as well as programs conducted with strategic partners (including a number of candidates in development with Hisamitsu). Candidates include new ADHD, pain, and women's health therapeutics. The Novogyne venture is pursuing the development of new transdermal estrogen patches; it developed Minivelle, a non-hormonal oral product for treating menopause-related hot flashes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In general, the company has seen substantial growth through its partnerships with other pharmaceutical firms. It continues to seek strategic relationships to help develop, manufacture, and commercialize new products. Additionally, Noven is open to acquiring products in order to boost its portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beyond its organic and partner-driven growth, the company's expansion strategies include enhancing marketing and commercialization efforts.
