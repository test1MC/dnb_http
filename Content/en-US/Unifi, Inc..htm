   Unifi textures, dyes, and twists multifilament polyester and nylon yarns and allied raw materials. Its polyester yarns are sold to an array of original knitting and weaving manufacturers of apparel goods, industrial textiles, home furnishings, and auto upholstery fabrics. Unifi nylons are marketed for apparel, hosiery, and sock manufacture. Polyester and nylon partially oriented yarn (POY), which is also purchased from suppliers, is often not sold, but further treated to create blends offering a variety of performance advantages. The US is Unifi's largest market.

  <p>
   Unifi divides its operations into three primary segments: Polyester, Nylon, and International. Polyester is its most lucrative, generating 60% of its total sales each year. Nylon represents about 20% and makes nylon and covered spandex yarns catering to producers of fabric for the apparel, hosiery, sock and other end-use sectors. International accounts for the remainder of revenue and makes textured polyester yarns to the South American and Asian regions.

  <p>
   Unifi's major markets include the US (almost 75% of total sales) and Brazil (roughly 15%); it also targets Canada. Unifi has manufacturing facilities in Brazil, Colombia, and El Salvador and joint ventures in Israel (with Nilit Ltd.) and the US (with

   ).

  <p>
   Unifi sells and markets it products through a sales team operating in Brazil, China, El Salvador, and Colombia, and the US. Independent sales agents cater to other countries. Its top 10 customers accounted for 33% of its sales in 2016.

  <p>
   Unifi's revenues declined 6% from $687 million in 2015 to $644 million in 2016. Profits also fell 18% from $42 million to $34 million during that same time period. The company's cash flow has fluctuated over the years, after declining in 2015, cash flow jumped from $39 million to $56 million in 2016 mostly due to gains made from deferred income taxes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The declines for 2016 were attributed to unfavorable foreign currency translation rates and sales declines in Brazil, one of its most targeted markets. Its Polyester and Nylon segments were also affected by a decrease in pricing following a decline in raw material costs.

  <p>
   Unifi attributes its momentum to the promising economic turnaround (particularly in retail apparel sales), as well as to several manufacturing improvements and marketing initiatives. Furthermore, the company has benefited from a recovery of regional textile supply sources that meet the import requirements of the US-Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) -- such as
   <company id="112867">
    Nan Ya Plastics Corp. USA
   </company>
   and
   <company id="111640">
    INVISTA
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Although the company anticipates continuing benefits from free trade agreements and legislation requiring a number of US agencies to buy American textiles, Unifi's offensive moves include developing and commercializing branded specialty and PVA branded yarns. The strategy reaches beyond its manufacturing customers to court consumer demand for end products using its yarns. Among its approximate 20 PVA trademark yarns, SORBTEK, A.M.Y., and Mynx tout a range of specialized functions (moisture management, ultraviolet protection, anti-microbial control for odor), as well as comfort and visual appeal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Internationally, Unifi believes its Chinese subsidiary will enhance its ability to service its customers who have global supply chains. It will also provide a solid foundation for expansion into key markets in Asia, such as Sri Lanka and Vietnam, where customers have expressed additional interest in sourcing its products.
