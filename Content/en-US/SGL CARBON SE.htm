   Established in 1872, SGL CARBON helps the steel industry get hot under the collar. The company, one of the world's largest makers of graphite and carbon products, makes electrodes used to melt steel scrap. SGL CARBON also manufactures mechanical carbons and electrical contacts, along with graphite foils, carbon fibers, expanded graphite and fabrics, composites, carbon-ceramic brake discs, and fuel cell components. Customers range from companies in the aerospace and automobile industries to chemical and energy companies in 100 countries. The company operates more than 40 factories in Europe, North America, and Asia.

  <p>
   SGL Group has a global structure with more than 40 production sites throughout the world. Almost 25 of these sites reside in Europe, 11 in North America, and eight in Asia. Asia and Europe (excluding Germany) each account for 25% of total revenue. Germany generates 17% and North America accounts for 23%. Other regions account for the remainder.

  <p>
   The 1992 merger of Germany-based SIGRI (then owned by
   <company id="41786">
    Hoechst
   </company>
   ), and US-based Great Lakes Carbon created SGL CARBON GROUP. After the merger, the company restructured its operations into global units. The next year SGL CARBON GROUP acquired
   <company id="42955">
    Pechiney
   </company>
   's graphite units based in Belgium, France, and Spain and combined them with its own graphite operations. Adding the Carbide/Graphite Group to its growing stable of businesses in 1994, the company prepared to go public.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 SGL CARBON GROUP did go public, with Hoechst reducing its stake to 50% plus one share. The company continued to acquire complementary businesses, and over the next two years SGL CARBON GROUP strengthened its specialty graphite and technical products units by purchasing Polgraph (Poland) and Vicrab (France). The company also listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange during this period, with Hoechst selling its stake.
  </p>
  <p>
   SGL CARBON GROUP increased its holdings in companies in Poland, the UK, and the US in 1997. The company renamed itself SGL CARBON AG and restructured as a holding company the next year. Also in 1998 the
   <company id="150279">
    US Justice Department
   </company>
   placed the company under investigation for allegedly fixing prices in the graphite electrode market. The company paid $135 million to settle the matter in 1999 (Robert Koehler, the company's CEO, paid a $10 million fine). The next year, a US appeals court dismissed SGL CARBON's petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a bad-faith effort designed to avoid paying debts incurred from civil lawsuits spurred by the price-fixing case.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company was fined about $70 million by the EU in the price-fixing scheme. The following year SGL CARBON entered into a joint venture with
   <company id="55595">
    Tokai Carbon Co., Ltd.
   </company>
   , to make ultrahigh-power graphite electrodes in China. In 2003 the company's electrical contacts unit of SGL Risomesa S.p.A. (Milan, Italy) was sold to the
   <company id="116845">
    Schunk Group
   </company>
   for an undisclosed price.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 SGL CARBON opened a new plant in Banting, Malaysia. The SGL Group announced plans to make the facility a core site in its global production network, especially in serving its growing number of Asian customers. Production in the plant was slated to start with semi-finished graphite electrodes and machining. Goals set 2011 as the target for making the Malaysian facility a fully integrated carbon and graphite hub producing graphite electrodes and cathodes with an annual capacity of 60,000 tons. SGL CARBON planned to ultimately invest more than â‚¬200 million in the facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2009 the company created a 50/50 joint venture with Brembo, consolidating their activities in carbon ceramic brakes for the automotive industry. Brembo SGL Carbon Ceramic Brakes makes, naturally enough, carbon ceramic brake discs for commercial vehicles and passenger cars.
