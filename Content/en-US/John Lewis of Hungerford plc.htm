   In fiscal 2016 (ended August), revenue grew 5% to £8.2 million amid a like-for-like sales increase in all bar two showrooms -- these latter two in Harrogate and Tunbridge Wells were shut down as a result. The number of kitchens sold increased 5% to 314, of which 90% were installed by JLH's in-house installation team. Bedroom sales were flat at 85. However, despite decent sales growth, the company made a loss of £400,000 in FY2016 (versus a loss of £138,000 in prior year) due to tighter margins, restructuring costs that grew disproportionately to sales, and costs relating to showroom closures.

  <p>
   JLH closed two showrooms (Tunbridge Wells and Harrogate) as their poor locations starved them of footfall. The company is combating lower high street footfall more generally by upping its online presence, including the launch of a new website. The new website is not an e-commerce site, rather an online showroom. The company reported an uptick in store visits an a 10% increase in leads since the mid-2016 launch. JLH also concurrently escalated its social media presence.

  <p>
   The roll out of the new modern-styled Pure range of kitchen and bedroom furniture is proving successful and driving sales at the showrooms in which it features.
