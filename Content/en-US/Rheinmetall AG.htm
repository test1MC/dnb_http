   Make Rheinmetall's day: Drive your car to an army base. The company has two main businesses -- automotive and defense. Rheinmetall's

   subsidiary offers automobile engine components (bearings, pistons, pumps) and spare parts. The Rheinmetall Defense sector manufactures radar defense systems, weapons and ammunition, and armored vehicles, and offers simulation and training services. Rheinmetall also makes electronics for military and national security uses. The company maintains about 50 facilities in Asia, Europe, and North and South America. Customers in Europe make up about two-thirds of sales, with those located in Germany accounting for almost 30%. Rheinmetall was formed in 1889.

   Engineer Heinrich Ehrhardt opened a machine tool factory in 1878 in Zella, Germany. His friend, Josef Massenez, owned a munitions factory that had won a German War Ministry contract that it could not fill. Massenez offered the contract to Ehrhardt in exchange for a commission. Ehrhardt gathered investors and founded Rheinische Metallwarren- und Maschinenfabrik AG in 1889. The company soon operated in rented space, turning out 800,000 bullets a day. Ehrhardt began building a permanent home for the company in Düsseldorf-Derendorfin in the early 1890s.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1914 the company employed 8,000 people. A year later, after the outbreak of WWI, it had 11,000 employees, and by 1918 the number had grown to 48,000. After the war the company laid off 22,000 workers and shifted to making nonmilitary products. During the transition the company stayed solvent by issuing bonds. Ehrhardt retired in 1922, and in 1924 a majority stake in the company was acquired by the government. Four years later Ehrhardt died.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rheinische Metallwarren- und Maschinenfabrik was hit hard by Germany's postwar economic crisis, but it survived by acquiring competitors such as August Borsig GmbH that faced liquidation. The company was renamed Rheinmetall-Borsig AG and was again making weapons and munitions for the German military by the mid-1930s.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1938 the company moved its headquarters from Düsseldorf to Berlin. It developed nearly 20 new weapons systems for the Nazi regime by 1944. At war's end, most of Rheinmetall-Borsig's factories had been either bombed or dismantled by the Allies, and production ceased until the 1950s. The company was reorganized in 1951 with Borsig AG in Berlin and Rheinmetall AG in Düsseldorf. Both companies came under the control of the newly incorporated Rheinmetall-Borsig AG, which was controlled by the German government.
  </p>
  <p>
   The state sold its stake in the company to Röchlingsche Eisen- und Stahlwerke GmbH in 1956. Later that year Borsig was sold and Rheinmetall-Borsig was renamed Rheinmetall Berlin AG. In 1957 its subsidiary in Düsseldorf became Rheinmetall GmbH. The company soon resumed military production. Rheinmetall delivered its first tank in 1979 -- the Leopard 2.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1981 Rheinmetall acquired majority shares of packaging machinery companies Ganzhorn &amp; Stirn GmbH and Jagenberg AG. The company added Pierburg GmbH (carburetion and motor components) in 1986 and nonmilitary explosives firm Pyrotechnische Fabrik Oskar Lünig GmbH in 1992. That year Rheinmetall GmbH shut down its Düsseldorf facilities and moved its headquarters to Ratingen.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rheinmetall Berlin bought a 63% stake in Preh-Werk GmbH (auto electronics) in 1993, expanding Pierburg's product line. In 1996 Rheinmetall and Badenwerk AG together purchased a 51% share in defense contractor STN Atlas Elektronik GmbH; British Aerospace (now BAE SYSTEMS) held the remaining 49%. Rheinmetall bought out Energie Baden-Württemberg's (formerly Badenwerk) share in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitive Rheinmetall bought an initial 25% share of Kolbenschmidt AG (engine parts) in 1997, increased its holding by an additional 29% later that year, and added the business to its Pierburg unit to form Kolbenschmidt Pierburg AG. The company bought Zollner Pistons (US) in 1999. Also that year Rheinmetall organized its defense operations under Rheinmetall DeTec AG and helped to form ADITRON AG by merging Rheinmetall Elektronik with Beteiligungen AG and KIH AG. It also purchased the pump unit of

    Magneti Marelli
   </company>
   . In 2000 Rheinmetall sold its packaging business to German engineering firm IWKA (now
   <company id="92220">
    KUKA
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company announced in 2001 plans to form a joint venture with Alliant Techsystems that would have combined the companies' global arms and ammunition operations, but the deal fell through.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Rheinmetall increased its stake in
   <company id="102703">
    Kolbenschmidt Pierburg
   </company>
   to 95%. Late in the following year Röchling Industrie Verwaltung GmbH sold its 42% stake in Rheinmetall.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2004 the company closed out its electronics sector by selling majority control of Hirschmann Electronics to
   <company id="133633">
    HgCapital
   </company>
   . Rheinmetall formed a joint venture with DIEHL Munitionssysteme and RAFAEL to serve as the prime contractor for the EuroSpike missile program.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2005 the company received a number of contracts from the German army, including delivery of a prototype of the Puma armored vehicle, marking 50 years of working closely with the Bundeswehr, originally the armed forces of West Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rheinmetall DeTec was merged that year into its parent and renamed the Rheinmetall Defence sector. In 2007 Rheinmetall bought the last 5% of Kolbenschmidt Pierburg for €27 to make it a wholly owned subsidiary. Also that same year the company acquired a majority stake in Chempro, which gave Rheinmetall additional technologies for protections systems. It also acquired Mexico-based Dana Corporation and Japan-based Nippon Piston Ring, which increased the company's international market presence.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2008 the company acquired Denel Munitions, a South Africa-based maker of artillery munitions. The acquisition gave Rheinmetall access to new markets in the Middle East, South Africa, and Asia.
