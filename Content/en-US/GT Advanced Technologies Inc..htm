   GT Advanced Technologies (formerly GT Solar International) is a beacon on the path of the solar power supply chain. The company manufactures the equipment used by other companies to produce silicon wafers and solar cells. Key products include chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactors used to produce polysilicon, the raw material in solar cells; and directional solidification systems (DSS), the furnaces used to transform polysilicon into ingots, which are sliced into silicon wafers to become solar cells. GT Advanced Technologies does most of its business in Asia, primarily in Malaysia. In 2014 the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It left bankruptcy in 2016 after a financial restructuring.

  <p>
   The company outsources most of its manufacturing process to third-party companies in Asia. It operates manufacturing centers in California, Massachusetts, Montana, and New Hampshire that assemble and test its final products, which are then shipped out to customers -- more than 80% of which are back in Asia. GT Advanced Technologies has manufacturing operations in China (Shanghai, Beijing, and Hong Kong) Germany, and Taiwan.

    Tokuyama
   </company>
   (37% of total sales), Polysilicon Technology (15%), and SMP (12%). Its customer base extends outside of the solar components sector, however, to include chemical companies that manufacture polysilicon, including longtime customer

   (The company shifted its fiscal year from March 31 to December 31 during 2012, distorting 2013-2012 year-to-year financial comparisons).
  </p>
  <p>
   The Polysilicon business contributed about 73% of the company's total revenues in 2013; Sapphire business, 16%; and Photovoltaic business, 11%.
  </p>
  <p>
   GT Advanced Technologies reported a loss of $82.8 million in 2013 due to higher operating expenses, including research and development ($83 million), higher general and administrative expenses ($69 million), while Amortization of intangible assets expenses reported in at $11.1 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company used $159.1 million of cash in operations in 2013 related to their net loss combined with a net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities and the effects of non-cash amortization, depreciation, and share-based compensation. The changes in operating assets included a decrease in customer deposits of $91 million, a decline in deferred revenue of $59.2 million, a drop in income taxes payable of $18.8 million, and a net loss of $82.8 million. These amounts were offset by a decrease in inventories of $9.3 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $29.8 million.

  <p>
   In 2014, GT Advanced Technologies acquired exclusive rights from Kyma Technologies for its plasma vapor deposition process technology and know-how from Kyma Technologies, which expects to offer a production-ready tool in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company purchased Thermal Technology, a developer of a wide range of high temperature thermal and vacuum products used in the fabrication of advanced materials that are deployed across multiple industries including, LED, medical devices, oil and gas and automotive.

  <p>
   In 2012, company acquired Twin Creeks Technologies, a privately owned company involved in the development of an ion implanter technology, which the Company refers to as the Hyperion ion implanter for $15.4 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought Missouri-based Confluence Solar in 2011 in an all-cash transaction worth up to $80 million. Confluence Solar developed a technology called HiCz that GT Advanced Technologies expects will improve the efficiency of its DSS equipment in making monocrystalline wafers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 GT Advanced Technologies further expanded its customer base with the purchase of Crystal Systems for $24 million in cash and 5 million shares of GT Advanced Technologies stock. Crystal Systems, located in Salem, Massachusetts, manufactures sapphire substrates used in the LED (light-emitting diode), defense, medical, and aerospace industries. GT Advanced Technologies is tapping the growing LED market, a component in flat-screen TVs and light bulbs.
