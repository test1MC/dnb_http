   No matter how you coat it, Sherwin-Williams is one of the top paint manufacturers in the US and worldwide (along with
   <company id="41855">
    Akzo-Nobel
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="11139">
    PPG Industries
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41028">
    Henkel
   </company>
   ). Sherwin-Williams' products include a variety of paints, finishes, coatings, applicators, and varnishes sold under brands such as Dutch Boy, Krylon, Sherwin-Williams, Thompson's WaterSeal, Ronseal, Sayerlack, and Minwax. The company operates more than 4,100 paint stores worldwide. It sells automotive finishing and refinishing products through wholesale branches worldwide.

   for $9.5 billion.

  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Sherwin-Williams has expanded its operating segments from three to four because of growth in sales, geographic reach, and product lines. It added a Latin American Coatings Group to its Paint Stores Group, Global Finishes Group, and Consumer Group segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Paints Stores Group, (63% of 2015 revenues), operates the biggest network of specialty paint stores (almost 4,090 company-operated specialty paint stores in North America), serving painting contractors as well as do-it-yourself homeowners.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Global Finishes Group (17%) manufactures and sells automotive finishes, industrial coatings, and marine coatings worldwide. Acquisitions are pivotal to the growth of this segment, bringing new technology in key areas.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Consumer Group (14%) supplies both branded and private-label products throughout North America and parts of Europe. It consists of a North American supply chain of 66 manufacturing plants and 37 distribution centers, and also supports the company's Paint Stores Group with new product development and research, manufacturing, and distribution.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once operating within the Global Finishes Group, the Latin America Coatings Group (6%) develops and produces a variety of architectural paint and coatings and related products throughout Latin America. It distributes its products through specialty paint stores, as well as through direct and outside sales reps, dealers, and distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sherwin-Williams' subsidiaries include Comex North America, Inc., Contract Transportation Systems Co, Oy Sherwin-Williams Finland Ab, Sherwin-Williams Bel, Sherwin-Williams (Belize) Limited, and Sherwin-Williams France Finishes SAS.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Sherwin-Williams develops, manufactures, distributes, and sells paint, coatings, and related products to professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers. Sherwin-Williams reported advertising costs of $299.2 million in 2014, and $262.5 million in 2013.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has seen its revenues rise over the last five years
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 net revenue increased by 2% due to higher paint sales volume in the Paint Stores and Consumer Groups.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net sales in the Paint Stores Group rose thanks to higher architectural paint sales volume across all end market segments. Net sales from stores open for more than twelve calendar months increased by4.2%. In 2015 the Paint Stores Group opened 113 new stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net sales of the Consumer Group increased due primarily to a new agreement to sell architectural paint under the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams brand through a large US national retailer's network of stores. Sales of wood care coatings, brushes, rollers, caulk and other paint related products, were all up at least mid to high-single digits, while sales of aerosol products were down slightly.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from The Global Finishes Group decreased due to unfavorable currency translation rate changes. Paint sales volume percentage increased slightly as compared to 2014, but unfavorable currency translation rate changes in the year decreased net sales by 7.5% for 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Latin America Coatings Group revenues declined due primarily to unfavorable currency translation rate changes and lower paint sales volume partially offset by selling price increases. Paint sales volume percentage decreased in the mid-single digits. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes in the year decreased net sales by 19.3%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sherwin-Williams has also recorded an increasing trend in net income over the last five years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 net income grew by 22% due to higher net sales, and a decrease in other general expense (net).
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities increased by 34%.

  <p>
   Sherwin-Williams focuses on enhancing its operations and growing market share. As part of its strategy, Sherwin-Williams invests more than $100 million per year in research, development, and commercialization of new product technologies. In 2015 the company opened 113 new stores and closed 30 redundant locations, increasing the total number of stores in operation at December 31, 2015 to 4,086 in the US, Canada, and the Caribbean.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company intended to open new additional 90 to 100 stores during 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also plans to continue to strengthen and expand OEM coatings capabilities globally. It expanded industrial powder coatings reach and capacity with new manufacturing facilities in Poland and Mexico. In 2015, tSherwin-Williams launched more than 40 new architectural paint products in the  Paint Stores Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Sherwin-Williams introduced sketch pad dry erase clear gloss coating in a pre-packaged kit. It also introduced SuperDeck, featuring Duckback technology, including products for staining, sealing, stripping, cleaning and restoring decks.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company and
   <company id="125434">
    HGTV
   </company>
   launched HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams in Canada. First introduced to the US market in 2012, the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams collection features interior and exterior paint, wallpaper and pre-coordinated color palettes, making it easy for consumers to create a cohesive look throughout their homes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions are also key to the company's strategy for growth and for the addition of new technologies.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2016 the company and the
   <company id="16976">
    Valspar
   </company>
   entered into a definitive agreement under which the company will acquire for approximately $9.5 billion. The acquisition expands its brand portfolio and customer relationships in North America, significantly strengthens their Global Finishes business, and extends the company's capabilities into new geographies and applications, including a scale platform to grow in Asia-Pacific, and EMEA.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 1870 Henry Sherwin bought out paint materials distributor Truman Dunham and joined Edward Williams and A. T. Osborn to form Sherwin, Williams &amp; Company in Cleveland. The business began making paints in 1871 and became the industry leader after improving the paint-grinding mill in the mid-1870s, patenting a reclosable can in 1877, and improving liquid paint in 1880.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1874 Sherwin-Williams introduced a special paint for carriages, beginning the concept of specific-purpose paint. (By 1900 the company had paints for floors, roofs, barns, metal bridges, railroad cars, and automobiles.) Sherwin-Williams incorporated in 1884 and opened a dealership in Massachusetts in 1891 that was the forerunner of its company-run retail stores. The company obtained its "Cover the Earth" trademark in 1895.
  </p>
  <p>
   Before the Depression, Sherwin-Williams bought a number of smaller paint makers: Detroit White Lead (1910), Martin-Senour (1917), Acme Quality Paints (1920), and The Lowe Brothers (1929). Responding to wartime restrictions, the company developed a fast-drying and water-reducible paint, called Kem-Tone, and the forerunner of the paint roller, the Roller-Koater.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales doubled during the 1960s as the company made acquisitions, including Sprayon (aerosol paint, 1966), but rising expenses kept earnings flat. In 1972 the company expanded its stores to include carpeting, draperies, and other decorating items. But long-term debt ballooned from $80 million in 1974 to $196 million by 1977, when the company lost $8.2 million and suspended dividends for the first time since 1885.
  </p>
  <p>
   John Breen became CEO in 1979, reinstated the dividend, purged over half of the top management positions, and closed inefficient plants. He also focused stores on paint and wallpaper merchandise and purchased Dutch Boy (1980).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 Sherwin-Williams began selling Dutch Boy in Sears stores and Kem-Tone in Wal-Marts. Acquisitions that year included Borden's Krylon and Illinois Bronze aerosol operations and DeSoto's architectural coatings segment, which made private-label paints for Sears and Home Depot. In 1991 Sherwin-Williams bought two coatings business units from Cook Paint and Varnish and the Cuprinol brand of coatings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sherwin-Williams purchased paint manufacturer Pratt &amp; Lambert in 1996. That year it introduced several new products, including Low Temp 35, a paint for low temperatures; Healthspec, a low-odor paint; and Ralph Lauren designer paints. Prep-Rite do-it-yourself interior primers debuted in 1997. Also that year Sherwin-Williams bought Thompson Minwax (Thompson's Water Seal, Minwax Wood Products) from Forstmann Little, and Chile-based Marson Chilena, a spray paint maker.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company streamlined some of its business segments and trimmed jobs in 1998. Christopher Connor, president of the Paint Stores group, replaced Breen as CEO in 1999 and chairman in 2000. Also in 2000, Sherwin-Williams moved into the European automotive coatings market by acquiring Italy-based ScottWarren.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2001 the company acquired Wisconsin-based Mautz Paint Company.
  </p>
  <p>
   After a rough but still profitable 2001, the company grew revenues and profits for its consumer units (consumer paints and paint stores) in 2002, thanks largely to a healthy do-it-yourself market. Sales for its automotive finishes and international units, however, were down because of a slow collision-repair market and currency-exchange effects.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Sherwin-Williams bought
   <company id="59140">
    Arch Chemicals
   </company>
   ' Sayerlack, a leading Italian wood care coating company, and acquired Becker Acroma Industrial Wood Coatings, a Swedish manufacturer of industrial wood coatings. It also acquired all shares of AlSher Titania (a joint venture with
   <company id="89483">
    Altair Nanotechnologies
   </company>
   ) it did not already own, giving it a 100% stake in the technology company. AlSher Titania is developing a promising titanium dioxide technology that Sherwin-Williams plans to commercialize.
  </p>
  <p>
   That same year, the company also acquired Pinturas Cóndor, an Ecuadorian diversified coatings supplier with $60 million in annual sales, bolstering its market share in architectural paint in Latin America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among its acquisitions in 2011 was UK-based Leighs Paints, a leader in fire-protectant (intumescent) coatings. (Because the intumescent technology prolongs the structural integrity of steel and concrete in a catastrophic fire, more people are able to evacuate.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Sherwin-Williams made a significant purchase in the buyout of Jiangsu Pulanna Coating Co., headquartered in Changzhou, China. Pulanna is an automotive refinishes coatings manufacturer, and the deal improved Sherwin-Williams' presence in the most populous country in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2012, Sherwin-Williams picked up Geocel Holdings, a maker of caulks, sealants, and adhesives serving construction and repair applications. Geocel has locations in the US and the UK, and the deal strengthened Sherwin-Williams' Consumer Group segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a major geographic expansion, in late 2012 the company agreed to acquire
   <company id="105224">
    Grupo Comex
   </company>
   , a leader in the paint and coatings market in Mexico, for $2.34 billion. However, Mexico's antitrust regulator blocked the deal in mid-2013, stating the new company could artificially set higher prices at its discretion. Sherwin-Williams subsequently terminated the proposed deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, in 2013 the company acquired the US/Canada business of Comex. Sherwin-Williams paid $90 million in cash and assumed liabilities in the range of $75 million. Comex operations in the US and Canada consist of 314 company operated stores (234 in the US and 80 in Canada) and 8 manufacturing sites (5 in the US and 3 in Canada). In addition, Comex supplies paint and coatings products to 1,500 external retail locations.
  </p>
  <p>
   2013 product launches included Sherwin-Williams Protective &amp; Marine Coatings' Magnalux 404 FF, the first styrene-free vinyl ester for use with steel and concrete substrates in the oil and gas market; Fast Clad 105ER, a 100% solids tank lining for crude oil and ethanol storage; and Nova-Plate 325, an extended lifecycle, 100% solids tank lining for high-temperature crude oil, produced water, and frac tank applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Sherwin-Williams teamed up with
   <company id="15167">
    Williams-Sonoma
   </company>
   to create seasonal palettes of Sherwin-Williams paint colors that coordinate with the Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, PBteen and West Elm collections.
