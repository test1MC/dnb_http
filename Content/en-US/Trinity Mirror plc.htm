   Trinity Mirror helps the UK take a look at itself. The newspaper publisher puts out five national and over 150 regional titles, along with upwards of 100 websites. Its portfolio includes the
   <em>
    Daily Mirror
   </em>
   and its weekend companion the
   <em>
    Sunday Mirror
   </em>
   . The company also operates the
   <em>
    Manchester Evening News
   </em>
   , as well as the
   <em>
    Daily Record
   </em>
   and the
   <em>
    Sunday Mail
   </em>
   in Scotland. Trinity Mirror's regional newspaper operations includes both daily and weekly paid titles, along with many free papers. The company's websites operate in conjunction with its print papers. In addition to publishing, the company offers contract printing services through about 10 printing plants.

  <p>
   Trinity Mirror operates four segments: Publishing, Printing, Specialist Digital and Central.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Publishing segment is by far the largest of the four, responsible for nearly 90% of total group sales. It sells around 600,000 papers a year, and its website pulls in over 27 million readers. The Printing segment's business is mostly with the Publishing arm, for which it provides printing services; it also works with third parties. Specialist Digital includes a digital recruitment classifieds business and digital marketing services. The Group's Central revenue consist of investment in regional news publisher Local World Holdings Limited.

  <p>
   Based in London, the company operates 48 units throughout the UK. It owns print plants and printing presses outside London, and has data centers in Canary Wharf and the Midlands. All the Group's sales come from the UK and Ireland.

   The company mainly sells directly to customers through online and print media. Its websites operate an advertising rather than subscription model.

   Like many of its rivals in the newspaper industry, Trinity Mirror has been struggling with declining readership over the past several years. Its woes were exacerbated by the recession which caused many advertisers to curtail spending.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, sales fell again -- by 7% on prior year -- to £592.7 million, as a reduction in advertising spend, particularly supermarkets, dragged down print sales. Revenue from circulation also fell due to the delayed cover price increase of the
   <em>
    Daily Mirror
   </em>
   . The Printing division also saw sales fall following the cessation of a newsprint supply arrangement with the
   <em>
    Independent
   </em>
   newspaper and the
   <em>
    i
   </em>
   publication.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income rose 10% to £77 million, the second successive year of profitability following a disastrous 2013. The increase in income is mostly attributable to a tax credit. A decline in administrative expense also contributed. Cash flow from operating activities fell 27% to £52.9 million.

  <p>
   Trinity Mirror pivoting towards online; page views increased 42% year on year, and digital revenue 22%. It added two new websites -- Dublin Live and Glasgow Live -- alongside its successful Belfast Live website, which launched in 2014 and brings in over 1 million users a month. The company also released a mobile app, Perspecs, which gives users three viewpoints on news items. And it released the ill-fated
   <em>
    The New Day
   </em>
   , a paid-for national daily newspaper in February 2016, but the publication closed only nine weeks after launch due to low demand.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company aims to become the largest newspaper publisher in the UK; double its number of regional titles; and grow its online audience. To that end it acquired Local World Holdings Limited, a publisher of regional news publications.

   In 2015, Trinity Mirror acquired Local World Holdings Limited, a UK-based regional newspaper publisher, for £220 million. The acquisition supports the company's strategy to become the UK's largest newspaper publisher.

  <p>
   The company's newspaper legacy began in 1855 with the debut of the
   <i>
    Liverpool Daily Post.
   </i>
   The UK's first penny daily, the paper earned publisher Michael James Whitty recognition as the "father of the penny press." After expanding with the
   <i>
    Liverpool Echo,
   </i>
   the company (then known as the Liverpool Daily Post and Echo) went public in 1904. It owned three papers by 1947 and expanded into Canada in the late 1950s.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company adopted the Trinity International name in 1985. In 1992 it sold its paper-making and packaging businesses and boosted its newspaper portfolio with the acquisition of Scottish &amp; Universal Newspapers. Trinity International's growth continued in the early 1990s with purchases Argus Press, Blackmore Vale, and Huddersfield Newspapers. Philip Graf was appointed CEO in 1993. The company expanded into magazines with the 1995 purchase of niche publications such as
   <i>
    Micro Computer Mart
   </i>
   and branched into cable TV with the debut of its Live TV channel.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 Trinity International became the largest regional newspaper publisher in the UK when it bought more than 50 daily and weekly newspapers, including the
   <i>
    Belfast Telegraph,
   </i>
   from The Thomson Corporation (now
   <company id="159650">
    Thomson Reuters
   </company>
   ). The company sold its Canadian operations to Black Press the same year and disposed of its US operations two years later. Trinity International shortened its name to Trinity plc in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Trinity unveiled its ic24 Internet service provider and portal. It also sold its unprofitable Live TV channel. Later that year Trinity acquired rival
   <company id="93625">
    Mirror Group
   </company>
   <em>
    ,
   </em>
   whose titles included
   <i>
    The Mirror,
   </i>
   the
   <i>
    Sunday Mirror,
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Sunday People.
   </i>
   Shortly thereafter, the newly renamed Trinity Mirror was left red-faced when it admitted that circulation figures for some of its publications had been inflated for six years.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a condition of the Mirror Group purchase, the government required Trinity Mirror to sell its titles in Northern Ireland, and in 2000 Independent News &amp; Media agreed to buy the
   <i>
    Belfast Telegraph
   </i>
   and several other publications. That year Trinity Mirror created its new media division and announced plans to launch local versions of its ic24 portal across the UK. In 2001 the company sold off its Internet service provider (ic24) and portal and announced some 800 jobs would be cut in the next several years because of the advertising downturn.That year
   <i>
    Sunday Mirror
   </i>
   editor Colin Myler resigned after a judge found that his newspaper published a prejudicial article concerning a violent incident involving Leeds soccer players. The company sold its ISP in 2001 to Brightview. That year the company also announced plans to lay off 800 workers by 2005 due to an advertising downturn.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company had a tough year in 2002. Price cutting at its
   <i>
    Daily Mirror
   </i>
   in an attempt to boost circulation and battle rival
   <i>
    The Sun
   </i>
   did not worked as planned, costing the company millions in lost revenue with no gain in circulation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Philip Graf stepped down as CEO in February 2003 and was replaced by
   <company id="55750">
    IPC Group
   </company>
   CEO Sly Bailey. She announced that the company would cut costs and exit its non-core Irish businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2004, the company sold its regional papers in Ireland to venture capital group
   <company id="47011">
    3i
   </company>
   . Later that year, the company's
   <i>
    Daily Mirror
   </i>
   title came under attack after it published photos -- later revealed to be faked -- that showed abuse by British troops of war prisoners. Responding to the continued downturn in the newspaper business, Trinity Mirror disposed of several non-core operations during 2006 and 2007, including a recruiting business and sports publishing (
   <em>
    Racing Post
   </em>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded its online publishing business by launching more than 200 websites covering local and regional news in 2008. In 2010 it acquired more than 30 newspapers, including the
   <em>
    Manchester Evening News
   </em>
   , from
   <company id="114793">
    Guardian Media Group
   </company>
