   CASIO COMPUTER wants a watch on every wrist and a handheld computer in every pocket. The firm makes a wide range of electronics for consumers, including calculators, cell phones, clocks, digital cameras, portable TVs, label printers, watches, and musical keyboards. CASIO COMPUTER also manufactures computing and communications devices, like PDAs and electronic cash registers. It operates though three segments: consumer (85% of sales), system equipment (12%), and others (3%). Nearly a third of sales are to customers in Japan.

  <p>
   Japan, where CASIO is based, is its largest market, accounting for 31% of revenue, followed by Asia, 28%, Europe, 15%, and North America, 13%.

   CASIO sells mostly through distributors in Japan, although it sells some system equipment directly to customers, such as central and local government offices. Overseas sales generally handled by the company's subsidiaries.

   Net income jumped 18% higher on the higher sales and lower research and development costs.

   CASIO seeks to remain a leader in consumer electronics and watches. In 2016 the company released its Smart Outdoor Watch in Japan and the US with plans for Europe in 2017.

  <p>
   In 1942 Tadao Kashio started a Tokyo-based machine shop, Kashio Manufacturing. His brother, Toshio, later joined him. After reading about a 1946 computing contest in which an abacus bested an electric calculator, Toshio, an inventor, wrote a note to himself: "Abacus is human ability; calculator is technology." In 1950 he began developing a calculator. The other Kashio brothers -- Yukio, a mechanical engineer, and Kazuo, who took over sales -- joined the company in the 1950s.
  </p>
  <p>
   The brothers incorporated in 1957 as CASIO COMPUTER, an Anglicization of the family name. That year the company launched its first product, an electric calculator featuring an innovative floating decimal point display; it was the first Japanese-built electric calculator. CASIO COMPUTER took advantage of new transistor technology to create electronic calculators, and in 1965 it introduced the first electronic desktop calculator with memory. The company began exporting to the US in 1970.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1970s only CASIO COMPUTER and Sharp emerged as significant Japanese survivors of the fierce "calculator war." CASIO COMPUTER's strategy of putting lots of new functions on a proliferation of small models and selling them at rock-bottom prices worked not only with calculators but with digital watches as well. The company introduced its first digital watch in 1974 and went on to dominate that market.
  </p>
  <p>
   CASIO COMPUTER expanded its product line into electronic music synthesizers (1980), pocket TVs (1983), and thin-card calculators (1983). Determined to break away from the production of delicate timepieces, CASIO COMPUTER introduced shock-resistant (G-Shock) digital watches in 1983. In the mid-1980s sales were hurt by a rising yen and stiff price competition from developing Asian nations. The company responded by releasing sophisticated calculators for such specialized users as architects and insurance agents. To offset the effects of the yen's heightened value in the late 1980s, CASIO COMPUTER moved manufacturing to Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, California, and Mexico. Kazuo Kashio was named president in 1988.
