   Nukote helps its customers get everything down in black and white. The company makes and markets about 3,000 products for more than 30,000 devices, including ink and toner cartridges for laser and ink-jet printers, copiers, and fax machines. As part of its business, Nukote also makes remanufactured and replacement cartridges. The company sells its products directly to select office products dealers, as well as to office superstores, electronics stores, and mass merchants under brand names such as ICMI, LCD, Nukote, and Pelikan. Nukote also makes private-label products for printer and copier manufacturers. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2009.

   Until a 1986 leveraged buyout, led by then-CEO David Brigante, Nukote Holding was the office supply division of Burroughs Corporation, which merged with Sperry that year to form
   <company id="11548">
    Unisys
   </company>
   . Nukote's original product was a non-messy carbon paper, but it also made typewriter and printer ribbons. In 1992, the year it went public, Nukote bought International Communication Materials, a maker of toner for non-impact printers and copiers. The purchase of Future Graphics, which remanufactured laser-printer cartridges and distributed cartridge components, followed in 1993.

   That year copier maker Ricoh sued the company for trademark infringement (settled in 1996). Other patent infringement lawsuits were filed by Hewlett-Packard (1994) and

   and Canon (1995), with Nukote filing countersuits in response. In 1995 it bought the Hardcopy Division of

    Pelikan Holding
   </company>
   , a major Swiss printer supplies maker.
  </p>

   Former COO Patrick Howard became CEO in 1997 while Brigante remained chairman. Amid losses, Nukote spent much of 1997 and 1998 restructuring -- laying off workers, consolidating and closing facilities, jettisoning product lines, and selling noncore units, such as the overseas Pelikan operations and the cartridge division of Future Graphics. Heavily in debt, the company entered bankruptcy protection in 1998. The next year saw several victories in court, with 11 of 14 Hewlett-Packard infringement claims being overturned and Nukote having to pay only $2 million in damages instead of the $8 million sought by Hewlett-Packard.

   Dallas-based investment bankers Richmont Capital Partners bought the company and took it private in 2000. Howard retired late in 2001 and COO Ronald Baiocchi became president and CEO.
