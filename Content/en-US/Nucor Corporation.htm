   Nucor takes a "minimillist" approach to succeeding in the steel industry. At its minimills, Nucor produces hot- and cold-rolled steel, steel joists, and metal buildings. It has the capacity to produce more than 26 million tons of steel per year. North America's largest recycler of scrap metal, it produces steel by melting scrap in electric arc furnaces. Most products are sold to steel service centers, manufacturers, and fabricators. Subsidiary

  <p>
   Nucor operates in three segments: Steel Mills, Steel Products, and Raw Materials. Its Steel Mills segment produces sheet steel, plate steel, structural steel, and bar steel. The Steel Products segment makes steel joists and joist girders, steel deck, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, and other products. Its Raw Materials segment produces DRI; brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron, and hot briquetted iron; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal. The steel mills are Nucor's largest segment, representing 67% of the company's sales to external customers in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Steel products contributed 25%; raw materials, 8%.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2015, the average utilization rates of all its steel mills, steel products, and raw materials segments were 68%, 63%, and 56% of production capacity, respectively.

  <p>
   Nucor's Steel Mills segment sells its products primarily to steel centers, fabricators, and manufacturers. About 60% of its sheet steel sales go to contract customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 about 86% of the shipments made by the company's steel mills were to external customers. It also sells steel mills and steel products mainly through in-house sales forces and also use internal distribution and trading companies to market our products outside of the US.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's net revenue has been decreasing in the last five years (2011-15), except in 2014. In 2015 net revenues decreased by 22% due to a decrease in all segments, particularly Steel mills, which fell mainly due to decrease in the average sales price per ton and a 9% decrease in tons sold to outside customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income has similar trend as net revenue over a period of five years. In 2015, Nucor's net income decreased by 50%. mainly due to lower revenues and highr impairments and losses on assets expenses, related to investment in Duferdofin, due to unfavorable operating performance and deterioration in financial projections caused by increased global overcapacity in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nucor's operating cash inflow increased by 61% to due to changes in working capital as a result of decreases in accounts receivable driven by decreased average sales prices per ton and outside shipments from the prior year, inventories, decline due to scrap and scrap substitute pricing and federal income taxes decreased due to Nucor's decreased profitability.

  <p>
   Nucor has dominated the minimill industry for more than two decades, but competitors in the sector are increasing. The company continues to expand its steel mills, add new facilities, and pursue a program of rapid external growth. Its organic growth strategies include optimizing existing operations and developing projects that capitalize on new technologies and opportunities in niche markets. The company also seeks acquisitions of companies complementary to its operations and international growth through joint ventures. A key part of its strategy is continuing to invest during downturn periods.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nucor has invested significant capital in recent years to improve their cost structure and expand their product portfolios to include more value-added, higher margined offerings, investments total nearly $6 billion during the last six years. Initiatives include the construction of an ironmaking facility in Louisiana, the commissioning a heat treating plant at its plate mill in North Carolina, the revamping a finishing rolling mill for a steel beam plant in Italy, and completing four acquisitions through its David J. Joseph.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also has a major emphasis on a cost improvement plan to reduce its raw materials cost.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nucor is looking to continue to seek opportunities to acquire businesses, enter into joint ventures, and make other investments.

  <p>
   In 2016 Nucor agreed to buy Independence Tube, a leading independent manufacturer of hollow structural section steel tubing, for $435 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also agreed to acquire
   <company id="47678">
    Southland Tube

  <p>
   Nucor started as the second carmaking venture of Ransom Olds, who built his first gasoline-powered car in 1897. Two years later, Samuel Smith, a Detroit copper and lumber magnate, put up $199,600 to finance Olds Motor Works. A fire destroyed the company's Detroit plant in 1901, so Olds moved production to Lansing, Michigan, where he built America's first mass-produced car -- the Oldsmobile. In 1904 Olds left Olds Motor Works, which was bought by
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   (GM) in 1908, and formed Reo Car Company (renamed Reo Motor Car in 1906). In addition to cars, it eventually made trucks and buses.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the end of the Depression,
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   , GM, and
   <company id="10334">
    Chrysler
   </company>
   commanded over 85% of the US passenger car market. Reo stopped making cars in 1936 and sold its truck manufacturing operations in 1957. Meanwhile, it had formed Reo Holding, which in 1955 merged with Nuclear Consultants to form Nuclear Corporation of America. The new company offered services such as radiation studies and made nuclear instruments and electronics.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1962 Nuclear bought steel joist maker Vulcraft and gained the services of Kenneth Iverson. The diverse company was unprofitable, losing $2 million on $22 million in sales in 1965. That year Iverson took over as CEO, moved headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina, and shut down or sold about half of the company's businesses. By focusing on its profitable steel joist operations, the firm ended 1966 in the black. Because the company depended on imports for 80% of its steel needs, Iverson decided to move into steel production. Nuclear Corporation built its first minimill in 1969.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was renamed Nucor in 1972. It started making steel deck (1977) and cold-finished steel bars (1979). Production tripled and sales more than doubled between 1974 and 1979.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nucor began to diversify, adding grinding balls (used in the mining industry to process ores, 1981); steel bolts, steel bearings, and machined steel parts (1986); and metal buildings and components (1987). Nucor and Japanese steelmaker Yamato Kogyo formed Nucor-Yamato and built a mill in 1988 to produce wide-flange beams (for heavy construction). The following year Nucor opened a state-of-the-art mill in Crawfordsville, Indiana, and another mill near Hickman, Arkansas, in 1992.
  </p>
  <p>
   Iverson turned over his CEO duties to company veteran John Correnti in 1996. The next year Nucor began building a steel beam mill in South Carolina and added a galvanizing facility to its Hickman mill.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Nucor announced plans to build its first steel plate mill, which became operational in 2000. The company slashed prices twice in 1998 to compete against low-cost imports from Russia, Japan, and Brazil. Both sales and earnings declined that year due to low metal prices, reduced shipments, and start-up costs for new plants. The company raised its prices in 1999 and continued its expansion plans. Differences with the board prompted Correnti to resign in 1999; chairman David Aycock assumed his duties. In September 2000 Aycock resigned from the company and Daniel DiMicco, formerly an EVP, moved up to the rank of CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nucor, along with Australia's Broken Hill Proprietary Corporation and Japan's Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, began a joint venture in 2000 for its technology strip casting. The new technology allows steel production in smaller, cheaper plants. In 2001 Nucor purchased a significant amount of assets of Auburn Steel, a producer of merchant steel bar, for $115 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Nucor teamed up with
   <company id="95034">
    Companhia Vale do Rio Doce
   </company>
   (Vale), a Brazilian producer and exporter of iron-ore pellets, to develop low-cost iron based products. That year Nucor purchased Alabama-based Trico Steel, a steel sheet producer, for approximately $116 million. In late 2002 Nucor bought financially troubled
   <company id="10213">
    Birmingham Steel
   </company>
   for $615 million in cash and debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nucor Steel Kingman, LLC, a subsidiary of Nucor Corporation, purchased the Kingman, Arizona, rebar and wire rod rolling unit of North Star Steel for around $35 million in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Vulcraft unit saw an increase in non-residential building construction in 2004, which boosted sales of joist girders, steel deck, and steel joists. Nucor bought
   <company id="107997">
    Nucor Tuscaloosa
   </company>
   in mid-2004, a producer of coiled plate with an annual capacity of around 700,000 tons. The following year saw the company purchase Ohio's
   <company id="107199">
    Marion Steel
   </company>
   for approximately $110 million. The mill was added to Nucor's bar products line.
  </p>
  <p>
   Record high prices in the industry (led by high demand throughout the world) led to record high sales in 2004. As a matter of fact, Nucor's first half of the year outpaced previous annual highs, and the company achieved that feat again in the second half.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company named CEO DiMicco chairman in 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the latter half of the last decade, it started a program of rapid external growth. It acquired the former
   <company id="114974">
    Connecticut Steel
   </company>
   , Verco Manufacturing, and Canadian steel products maker
   <company id="117957">
    Harris Steel
   </company>
   , which like Connecticut Steel had been a customer and partner of Nucor for years. Harris itself made an acquisition in 2008, when it bought rebar fabricator and distributor Ambassador Steel. Nucor also expanded its downstream operations with the 2007 acquisition of building systems maker
   <company id="108050">
    MAGNATRAX
   </company>
   for $280 million. Its largest acquisition was that of the David J. Joseph Company, a scrap metal broker that had supplied Nucor's minimills for 40 years.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has always operated primarily in the US, but in 2008 it moved into the international market with the formation of a European joint venture with Duferco. The JV produces steel beams and merchant bar products from manufacturing locations in Italy and serves the European and North African markets. Nucor put about $650 million into the new venture, called Nucor S.r.l. Duferdofin.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it also expanded considerably in the US by spending $1 billion to buy ferrous and nonferrous metals group
   <company id="54985">
    The David J. Joseph Company
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Nucor formed a US-based joint venture with Mitsui &amp; Co. Nucor paid $225 million for its half of the venture, named
   <company id="14800">
    Steel Technologies
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Nucor acquired New Jersey-based Skyline Steel and its subsidiaries from
   <company id="51740">
    ArcelorMittal
   </company>
   for about $605 million. Skyline, which has served as a distributor of Nucor's products for more than 20 years, accelerated Nucor's growth in steel piling and foundation products. Steel sheet piles are long structural sections having a vertical interlocking system that creates a wall. Skyline's flagship products include hot-rolled and cold-formed sheet piles and pipe piling. A steel foundation distributor in North America, Skyline serves industries that include marine construction, bridge and highway construction, heavy civil construction, and underground commercial parking.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Nucor sold its NuPro Steel subsidiary to Steel Technologies, its joint venture with
   <company id="56032">
    Mitsui &amp; Co
   </company>
   . NuPro produces flat-rolled steel at its plant in Crawfordsville, Indiana. Nucor also announced that Steel Technologies would build a steel processing plant in Mexico to serve Japanese electronics and auto companies moving into the region.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2011, Nucor and joint venture partners Rio Tinto Group, Mitsubishi, and Shougang Corp. permanently closed the high-intensity smelt (hismelt) steel plant in Kwinana, Western Australia. Nucor had a 25% stake in the joint venture that was terminated.
  </p>
  <p>
   Continuing its strategy for key acquisitions, in 2013 Nucor acquired Gallatin Steel for $780 million. This addition allowed the company to better serve customers by offering them a wider range of products and further enhancing our reliability. Nucor Steel Gallatin has an annual capacity of 1.8 million tons, increasing Nucor's total flat-rolled production to 13 million tons annually. The acquisition also  strengthens Nucor's position serving flat-rolled customers in the growing pipe and tube segment.
