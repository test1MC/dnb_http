   In early 2015 it announced it was acquiring the Bonne Bell and Lipsmacker products from Norwegian health and beauty company ASPIRE Brands AS. Bonne Bell started out offering flavored lip gloss to tweens but now sells lip, face, and eye makeup while leaving the lip gloss, in flavors like buttered popcorn and Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookie, to Lipsmacker. The purchase brings Markwins a perfect entre√® into the youth market.

   Besting a $65-million offer made by Swander Pace Capital in August 2012 to take Physicians Formula Holdings (PFH) private, Markwins acquired the prestige makeup and skin care company for $4.90 per share, or nearly $75 million. (For bowing out, PFH was required to pay Swander Pace some $1.3 million.) PFH is a maker of cosmetics and skin care products for the mass market and counts Wal-Mart, Target, and CVS among its customers. While Markwins and PFH share similar sales channels, they have non-competing brands and attract new customers as part of their alliance.
