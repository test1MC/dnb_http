   When the surgeon asks for a rongeur, and the assistant hands it over, Integrated Medical Systems International (IMS) wants to make sure it is in good condition. The company repairs, sterilizes, and maintains medical, ophthalmic, and surgical equipment either at the hospital or at one of its own laboratories. IMS also sells products such as instrument cabinets and cleaning devices, as well as certified pre-owned surgical equipment. Through its InstrumentReady program, the company also offers instrument-tracking software and support services aimed at making sure the right instruments, medical devices, and equipment are ready when a surgical or minimally invasive procedure begins. IMS is being purchased by STERIS.

  <p>
   In mid-2014 the company agreed to be acquired by hospital sanitizing and support firm STERIS for about $175 million. It will become part of STERIS' healthcare segment.

   In addition to refurbishing and repairing equipment, IMS will also customize instruments to meet a surgeon's specific needs. Other offerings include implant-tracking systems, minimally invasive surgery instrument management, and process improvement programs. IMS also distributes some third-party products, such as RxEnergy's lithium ion batteries for surgical handpieces.

   The company's Wedge Manufacturing subsidiary in Alabama supplies IMS with the small precision replacement parts it needs for instrument and equipment repair. Wedge has expanded its highly precise manufacturing capabilities to serve customers in the aerospace industry.

  <p>
   In 2012 IMS announced a strategy to double its revenues by 2017. The firm has grown in recent years by adding sterile process management and onsite operating room instrument management services to its lineup. It is also expanding facilities; in 2013 it renovated a property adjacent to its existing facility in Alabama -- adding a new 55,000-sq. ft. operating center for repair tasks -- to better serve the growing Southeast service territory.

  <p>
   The company was founded in 1990 by an orthopedic implant distributor who noticed a number of inefficiencies in the operating room instrument repair process.
