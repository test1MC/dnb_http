   The name Panasonic Mobile Communications rings in many ears. The company makes Panasonic-brand mobile phones and wireless base stations and terminals for building cellular communications networks. Panasonic also makes automotive electronics (such as car stereos and navigation systems), professional audio and video equipment, disk drives, electronic measurement equipment, and giant Astrovision video screens for sports arenas worldwide. Panasonic Mobile Communications is owned by
   <company id="41780">
    Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
   </company>
   (60%) and
   <company id="41873">
    Matsushita Electric Industrial
   </company>
   (40%).

  <p>
   Grade school dropout Konosuke Matsushita founded Matsushita Electric Industrial in 1918 with $50 and a plan to sell inexpensive lamps, batteries, radios, and motors.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWII the Japanese government ordered the company to build wood-laminate products for the military. Although postwar occupation forces prevented Matsushita from working at his firm for four years, he rejoined the company in 1952. The following year it moved into consumer goods, making televisions, refrigerators, and washing machines; it later expanded into high-performance audio products.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Konosuke formed Matsushita Communication Industrial in 1958 to focus on business and industrial electronics, he became the subsidiary's first president. The company introduced a variety of products during the 1960s, including broadcasting studio systems, traffic signal control systems, pagers, and communication systems for satellites. Early customers included the
   <company id="51300">
    Tokyo Broadcasting System
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41780">
    Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone
   </company>
   (NTT).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1966 Konosuke retired and named Katsumi Tanaka his successor.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1975 Matsushita Communication began making floppy disk drives for the nascent PC market. The next year Akisada Ogama replaced Tanaka. In 1979 Matsushita started making radio systems, such as taxi dispatching equipment, and in 1981 it expanded into digital public exchange phone systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Matsushita Communication continued to broaden its line of products during the 1980s, and in 1982 it installed its first giant Astrovision video screen, in Hankyu Baseball Stadium. Managing director Michitaka Ishizawa replaced Ogama in 1986.
  </p>
  <p>
   The end of NTT's government monopoly on cellular service in Japan in 1988 created an increased demand for wireless handsets and cellular infrastructure equipment, which Matsushita Communication began developing. However, profits remained flat and the next year Akira Matsuda, a managing director from Matsushita Electric Industrial, replaced Ishizawa.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 1992, faced with lagging sales and shrinking profits, the company discontinued its word processor product line, moved its floppy disk drive production to the Philippines, and consolidated its cell phone production. Matsushita Communication had grabbed 40% of the domestic cell phone market by 1993. That year senior managing director Takashi Kawada replaced Matsuda when he retired.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 the company introduced digital cordless phones and began selling cell phones under the Panasonic brand. Two years later Matsushita Communication began producing PC-based electronic measurement equipment. To expand its mobile phone business globally, the company in 1998 partnered with Northern Telecom (now Nortel Networks) to test cell phones and networks capable of transmitting voice and text.
  </p>
  <p>
   Matsushita Communication controlled 10% of the world cell phone market by 1999, the same year it developed the i-mode cell phone for
   <company id="58535">
    NTT DoCoMo
   </company>
   . That year the company bought a 9% stake in
   <company id="58043">
    Symbian
   </company>
   , joining Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia, and Psion in the wireless software alliance. In 2000 Matsushita Communication began courting European telecom services carriers as potential mobile phone customers and set up a manufacturing plant in the Czech Republic.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2001 Matsushita Communication reorganized its eight divisions into four product-oriented businesses: mobile communications, automotive multimedia, AV and security, and services and software. The next year majority owner Matsushita Electric Industrial acquired the remaining shares of Matsushita Communication that it did not already own to make it a wholly owned subsidiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   Matsushita Communication changed its name to Panasonic Mobile Communications in early 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company sold its stake in Symbian.
