   Alimera Sciences wants to see clear into the future. The biopharmaceutical develops prescription ophthalmic medicines, particularly those aimed at treating ocular diseases affecting the retina. Alimera's first commercialized product, Iluvien, is an injectable insert -- smaller than a grain of rice -- that slowly releases a corticosteroid to the back of the eye to treat diabetic macular edema (DME). DME, a retinal disease affecting diabetics, can lead to severe vision loss and blindness. Iluvien is approved in the US (where it became commercially available in 2015) and in about 20 nations in Europe. Alimera is investigating another group of drugs as potential treatments for macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.

  <p>
   The Iluvien compound, which uses a technology licensed from drug delivery firm
   <company id="137626">
    pSivida
   </company>
   , is effective for up to 36 months and may also have the potential to treat other macular diseases and retinal vein occlusion (RVO).
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to Iluvien, Alimera is investigating another group of drugs as potential treatments for macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.

  <p>
   Alimera is headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia; its European headquarters is located in the UK. The company also leases space in Berlin, Paris, and Portugal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Iluvien is approved in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the US.

  <p>
   The company sells Iluvien through an internal sales force and via independent distributors. Large pharmaceutical distributors in the US account for most of its sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alimera has also entered into various agreements through which partners will provide regulatory, reimbursement, or sales and marketing support in new markets including Canada, the Middle East, Australia, and New Zealand.

  <p>
   After Iluvien was approved in 2014, Alimera's revenues have risen. In 2015, the first year Iluvien was available in the US, revenue spiked 166% to $22 million. However, the company has lost money every year since its founding due to R&amp;D expenses and sales and marketing costs. Net loss decreased 15% to $30 million in 2015, due primarily to the increased revenue that year. Alimera's total accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2015, was $343.9 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow increased 87% to $45 million in 2015 as accounts receivable related to the US launch of Iluvien increased.

  <p>
   The company is working with other firms to get Iluvien approved and commercialized in additional markets. In 2015, it signed an agreement with MEAgate International, which plans to distribute Iluvien in the Middle East. The year before that it established a similar partnership with Specialised Therapeutics Australia for Iluvien's distribution in Australia and New Zealand.

  <p>
   Founded in 2003, Alimera was originally focused on developing and commercializing non-prescription ophthalmic drugs, and it generated revenue from sales of an over-the-counter product to treat dry eye. However, once it trained its sights on developing Iluvien, in 2006 and 2007 it sold off the development rights to its allergy candidates and dry eye drug to Bausch &amp; Lomb for some $16 million.
