   Feeding the world is poetry to Arcadia's ears. Agricultural biotech firm Arcadia Biosciences develops agricultural traits that increase crop yields and enhance the value of agricultural products. Its crop yield traits are being used in more than 50 products under development, including seeds for major commodity crops such as wheat, rice, soybean, corn, and sugarcane. The company typically acquires promising trait technologies, which it then develops further and tests in field trials. It has several partnerships with agricultural firms (

   ,
   <company id="59427">
    Dow AgroSciences
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="14440">
    DuPont Pioneer
   </company>
   , to name just a few) for the development and commercialization of its traits. Arcadia Biosciences went public in 2015.

   The company raised $65.6 million in its initial public offering. It intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes and for the further development and commercialization of its products, as well as for sales and marketing activities. In addition, Arcadia may pursue acquisitions of complementary companies, products, and technologies to expand its business.

   The use of genetically modified (GM) seeds in order to combat such crop stresses as weeds and bugs has been growing over the past few decades. Arcadia Biosciences and other agricultural biotechnology companies have also been working to develop seeds that can tolerate heat, drought, flooding, and other non-biological stresses. In fact, the GM seed market now represents more than half of the total seed market. By using GM seeds, farmers can potentially improve yields and cut costs related to insecticides and other chemicals. Agricultural Biosciences first commercial product, Sonova 400 GLA safflower oil (introduced in 2010) is used in a number of nutritional supplements marketed throughout the US; Sonova Ultra GLA safflower oil is the more concentrated version of the product.

   Arcadia Biosciences leases some 21,000 sq. ft. of office, laboratory, and growth chamber space in Davis, California. It leases an additional 4,000 sq. ft. of office and laboratory space in Seattle, Washington, and 2,000 sq. ft. of space in Phoenix. The company also leases greenhouse space and farm land in Northern California and Idaho.

   The US accounts for two-thirds of total revenue, followed by India, which accounts for nearly 30%.

   In 2014, revenue grew 8% to $7 million, primarily due to higher licensing earnings, but partially offset by lower product sales. Grants from US government agencies, including the
   <company id="139421">
    US Agency for International Development
   </company>
   , represent half of Arcadia's total revenues. Collaborations with other biotech firms also provide a significant amount of licensing revenues; in 2014, earnings from a partnership with Mahyco represented 29% of total revenue. Product revenues (5% of total) have consisted solely of sales of its Sonova safflower oil line.

   Since being founded in 2002, Arcadia Biosciences has incurred significant net losses, and it expects to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future. At the end of 2014 it had an accumulated deficit of $114 million. The company reported operating cash outflow of $14.8 million that year.

   The company is focused on developing traits for major global crops as well as secondary crops. It partners with basic research institutions and others in the industry to gain access to new traits and technologies. Its leading products under development address such issues as nitrogen absorption, drought, elevated salinity, and heat tolerance/climate change. Arcadia hopes to commercialize its products around the world.
