   Overhill Farms bought Bellisio Foods in late 2013 in a deal valued at $80.9 million. Bellisio Foods was attracted to the business for its bulging brands portfolio and West Coast manufacturing presence.

   As Overhill Farms weathered the national economic downturn, its sales to major customers declined in almost all markets. (Airline revenues were the exception due to new products developed for an existing customer.) Overhill Farms cited poor consumer confidence and lower demand as driving customer decisions to limit their orders and inventory levels. One of the company's key accounts, the
   <company id="10693">
    H. J. Heinz Company
   </company>
   , has opted to self-manufacture products previously produced by Overhill Farms. The company's expectations for a licensing agreement with Better Living Brands Alliance to exclusively produce and sell frozen entrees under the Eating Right and O Organics brands, failed to materialize.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other factors denting Overhill Farms' performance include higher fuel and commodity costs. In addition, the company made sizable one-time start-up investments in 16 new products under the Boston Market brand and 16 new products for Target. As a result, net revenues plummeted for several years.
  </p>
  <p>
   The frozen food maker has managed to reduce its debt and refinance its remaining loans on more favorable terms. To extend the Boston Market line, late 2011 it inked an agreement with
   <company id="103486">
    Bellisio Foods
   </company>
   to share in the manufacture, sale, and distribution of the brand. Overhill Farms has targeted opportunities, as well, in the foodservice market. To this end, it maintains an agreement with the
   <company id="40256">
    J.R. Simplot Company
   </company>
   , naming Simplot as the distributor of certain Overhill products to some of the largest foodservice accounts in the US. Overhill Farms is also standing by American Airlines, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy October 2011. The airline has assured suppliers that it will meet its bills.
