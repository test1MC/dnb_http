   GenMark Diagnostics knows the secrets that DNA holds are just as helpful to doctors as they are to
   <em>
    CSI
   </em>
   detectives. The company makes molecular diagnostic equipment designed to detect diseases and determine the best medications for a person's genotype. Its XT-8 system is FDA-approved to test for cystic fibrosis and sensitivity to the blood thinner warfarin, and the company is seeking approval for other diagnostics including tests for viral respiratory infections and thrombosis. The XT-8 is about the size of a microwave, can hold 24 blood-sample cartridges, and offers results in 30 minutes. GenMark Diagnostics was formed by
   <company id="102072">
    Osmetech
   </company>
   in 2010.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   GenMark has also developed the ePlex sample-to-answer system, which it expects to launch in 2017. The system integrates automated nucleic acid extraction and amplification with GenMark's detection technology to obtain infectious disease test results within 90 minutes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other products in the company's pipeline include the eSensor 2C19 Genotyping Test, eSensor 3A4/3A5 Genotyping Test, eSensor HCV Genotyping Test, and eSensor HCVg Direct Test.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has operations in Carlsbad, California. It outsources the manufacturing of its XT-8 system to Leica Biosystems Melbourne.

  <p>
   GenMark has a direct sales team and specialized service group to market its products. Its largest customer,
   <company id="14203">
    Laboratory Corporation of America
   </company>
   , represented 17% of the company's revenue in 2015.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Revenues have shown strong growth over the past five years. In 2015, revenue rose 29% to $39.4 million on higher product sales. The company installed XT-8 analyzers at 633 customer locations in 2015, versus 540 locations in 2014. Additionally, sales of the company's infectious disease assays have grown.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, GenMark operates in the red and it expects to do so for the next several years as it works to develop and commercialize its ePlex system. In 2015, its net loss increased 10% to $42.2 million as operating costs related to sales and marketing and employee-related expenses rose. R&amp;D costs also increased as ePlex development activities ramped up. As of December 31, 2015, the company had an accumulated deficit of $304.7 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Similarly, operating cash outflow increased 8% to $31.9 million in 2015.

  <p>
   GenMark is concentrating on the launch of its ePlex system in the US and Europe, as well as expanding sales of the XT-8 system in the US. The company plans to continue R&amp;D efforts on the ePlex system and on developing additional diagnostic test menus.

  <p>
   Osmetech, which had owned the XT-8 system since 2006, created GenMark Diagnostics in early 2010 as a means of relocating from the UK to the US. Through the public offering, GenMark Diagnostics became the parent company of Osmetech, which aimed to gain access to US investors after its first XT-8 tests were approved by the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   . To simplify its corporate structure, GenMark liquidated Osmetech in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   The technology behind the XT-8 was developed by Dr. Jon Faiz Kayyem, while he was a researcher at the
   <company id="115750">
    California Institute of Technology
   </company>
   . Dr. Kayyem founded Clinical Micro Sensors to develop the technology into a marketable product, then sold the company to Motorola (now known as
   <company id="11023">
    Motorola Solutions
   </company>
   ) in 2000 for $280 million. Osmetech purchased the company back in 2005 to ready the prototype for market.
