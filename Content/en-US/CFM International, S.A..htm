   ), the company manufactures a line of six aircraft engine models. Its name stems from its activities, combining the CF6 and M56, designations for commercial aircraft engines made by GE and Snecma. GE manufactures CFM International's engine cores and assembles roughly half of its engines; Snecma makes the fans and rotors and assembles the rest of the engines. Catering to more than 520 commercial and military operators worldwide, CFM International's engines can be found in

  <p>
   CFM International buckles up for the aviation industry's financial rise and fall. Critical, near-term, and long term practices guide the company. The recent economic downturn spurred CFM International to bring the issues faced by operators under its wing; aftermarket support has assumed greater importance on its slate of products and services. Moreover, shifting from mature markets, the company is courting developing arenas in China, India, the Middle East, Africa, and South America. Less urgent but ongoing, CFM International pushes engine technology upgrades; redesigned turbofans and lighter weight construction materials to offer fuel efficiency, and lower CO2 emissions and maintenance. Its LEAP-X program, an initiative for developing a narrow-body aircraft engine, looks ahead towards supporting air framers' future flight needs.

   have extended their partnership to the year 2040, and are currently developing the LEAP engine (adding more than 1.5 million sq. ft. of manufacturing space), which will power the next generation of single-aisle commercial aircraft. The advanced new LEAP engine (quieter and more fuel efficient) has achieved broad-based market acceptance with 6,000 engines on order. CFM International is on track for engine certification in 2016 by the

   in the US and EASA (Europe) and entry into airline service that year.

   As part of this expansion, the company planned to open four new facilities between 2013 to 2016.

   In 2014 Brazil-based Modern Logistics signed a comprehensive diagnostics services agreement with CFM International for the CFM56-3 engines powering its Boeing 737-400 freighter aircraft.

   To fuel growth and innovation, GE &amp; Snecma's research and development budget in 2013 was $7.5 billion.
