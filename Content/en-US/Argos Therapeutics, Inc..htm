   Argos aims to be a faithful servant of those fighting cancer and infectious diseases. The pharmaceutical firm's proprietary Arcelis platform uses biological components from the patient to create a white blood cell that triggers that patient's particular immune response. Its most promising candidate targets metastatic renal cell carcinoma, the most common kidney cancer. Argos also has an HIV treatment that is being funded by the

    NIH
   </company>
   , a lupus antibody, and a treatment for psoriasis in the pipeline. The company manufactures its products at its North Carolina plant but will expand production into a new facility pending drug approval. Formed in 1997, Argos filed to go public in 2011, withdrew in 2012, and actually went in 2014.

   Argos raised about $45 million in its early-2014 IPO. It plans to use the funds for clinical trials and a new manufacturing facility. Its kidney cancer treatment is closest to

   approval.

  <p>
   The company intends to commercialize its two products for kidney cancer and HIV as well as for other cancers. It will handle US sales and marketing of its cancer treatment but seek third-party assistance to take it global. Argos will seek government or third-party collaboration to commercialize and market its HIV treatment. For manufacturing, it will expand and build-out its current manufacturing facility that has been making the trial medications.
