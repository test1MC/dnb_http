   Dealer Tire is growing and adding additional people to its workforce. In mid-2016, it announced it will hire at least 100 more local employees over the next three years, given that the move is being funded in part by public money. This includes $8 million in financing, mostly loans, from the city and Cuyahoga County in Ohio, undisclosed incentives from JobsOhio, and more than $11 million in federal and state historic preservation tax credits.

   Dealer Tire also embraces technology as a means for growth. It has launched an online tire-buying service in northeast Ohio under the name "RightTurn.com" that directs users to nearby car dealers. The online system uses a step-by-step menu to recommend tires based on a person's vehicle make and model (and lifestyle). The company is experimenting with other technologies that could help dealers compete and is focused on how to harness data from cars. It also aims to help dealers get a leg-up as electric cars, and even autonomous cars, become more prevalent within the industry.
