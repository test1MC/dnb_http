   You won't turn your nose up at Meda Pharmaceuticals' products, especially if you've got a runny one. The specialty drug firm makes a number of prescription remedies for allergies, including its flagship product, Astelin nasal spray antihistamine. Meda Pharmaceuticals also makes therapies in niche markets, such as central nervous system disorders (its Felbatol treats epilepsy), insomnia, muscle spasms, and women's health products. Its Onsolis is a transdermal version of cancer pain drug fentanyl that dissolves inside the patient's cheek. The company's sales force targets doctors and hospitals; it is the US subsidiary of Swedish drug firm

   Meda Pharmaceuticals, also known as Meda USA, has research and development facilities near its headquarters in New Jersey; the company also operates manufacturing facilities in Illinois and New Jersey and an administrative office in Georgia. Meanwhile, the global Meda AB organization has operations in 55 countries and products sold in 120 nations; the US market accounts for about 15% of sales.

  <p>
   Prescription drugs for allergy products are core to Meda Pharmaceuticals. As such, the company re-worked Astelin into a new formula, Dymista, that combines the azelastine antihistamine with fluticasone proprionate -- another commonly prescribed allergy nasal steroid spray. (Fluticasone is sold as a generic and under the brand name Flonase.) Dymista received FDA approval in 2012 and the company hopes that it may become something of a blockbuster.

  <p>
   Meda Pharmaceuticals' revenues declined 8% to SEK2.5 billion ($380 million) in 2012 due to organic sales declines of 19% on generic competition for products including Felbatol, Soma, and Prefera, offset by growth from acquisitions.

  <p>
   Meda Pharmaceuticals growth strategy includes continued product expansions through acquisitions, licensing deals, and internal development. Meda Pharmaceuticals has to keep up a steady stream of new products as many of its drugs are faced with competition from generic products or other formulations. Its focus areas of development include allergy, respiratory, neurology, musculoskeletal, rheumatology, gastroenterology, and women's and men's health issues. The company also seeks to conduct cost-efficient research and manufacturing operations, while investing in promising growth candidates and markets.

  <p>
   In 2012 it acquired a small portfolio of products from
   <company id="138749">
    Jazz Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   for some $95 million. The deal helped to build up Meda Pharmaceuticals' women's health line with such products as Elestrin, an estrogen replacement therapy.

  <p>
   In the late 1920s Henry Hoyt observed from the sidelines his father-in-law's company, which made Carter's Little Liver Pills. Frustrated Hoyt believed the company should spend more on product development. In 1929 he took matters into his own hands, secretly purchasing controlling interest in the firm.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hoyt sacrificed dividend payouts to invest in intensive research and development. His strategy paid off over the next couple of decades as the company (renamed Carter Products in 1937) introduced such hits as Arrid (1935; formulated by Princeton research chemist John Wallace), Nair (1940), and Rise (shaving cream, 1949; sold to Faberge 1988).
  </p>
  <p>
   Carter Products broke into the drug industry in the 1950s when it bought Miltown, a prescription tranquilizer. In 1959 the US government claimed the name "Carter's Little Liver Pills" was misleading (the pills had nothing to do with treating the liver) and ordered a change. Carter-Wallace continued to sell the renamed Carter's Little Pills as a laxative throughout the 20th century.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm launched an aggressive buying program in the 1960s, including Lambert Kay (pet products, 1968) and Zavala Hermanos (Mexican toiletries, 1969). In 1965, in light of the hefty boost its Wallace Laboratory division gave to its bottom line, Carter Products became Carter-Wallace.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expansion continued in the 1970s and 1980s with such buys as Winsted Company (pet products, 1971), Maltsupex and Syllamalt laxative products (from Abbott Laboratories, 1974), Mallinckrodt's pharmaceuticals division (1979), Youngs Drug Products (maker of Trojans, 1985), Mentor's condom business (1989), and the Poupina line of infant health care products (from Groupe Monot, 1989).
  </p>
  <p>
   Henry Hoyt retired in 1986, leaving son Henry Jr. in charge. The elder Hoyt died three years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carter-Wallace grew its consumer and health products line by buying Tambrands' First Response pregnancy tests (1990); American Cyanamid's Lady's Choice antiperspirants and deodorants (1990); DuPont's Isostat Microbial System (1991); and the Cossack line of men's grooming products from the UK's Reckitt &amp; Colman (1991).
  </p>
  <p>
   In the mid-1990s the company suffered from adverse reactions to some of its newer drugs; antiepileptic Felbatol was found to cause liver damage and expectorant Organidin was carcinogenic to lab animals. Charges relating to discontinuing or restricting the use of these drugs brought a steep loss in 1995, following a smaller one in 1994.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its 1996 purchase of Cambridge Biotech, maker of tests to detect intestinal pathogens and Lyme disease, ushered the firm into the burgeoning diagnostics business; Carter-Wallace also added a line of autoimmune diagnostic kits from BioWhittaker (now Cambrex Bio Science). That year the company turned down investor Marvin Davis' near-billion-dollar buyout offer. The rejection -- on top of losses followed by lackluster earnings -- stirred shareholder discontent. Outside stockholders, including Roy Disney's Shamrock Holdings, demanded the company be put up for sale the next year. That proposal was also rejected.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carter-Wallace in 1999 won the US sales and marketing rights for Calypte Biomedical's professional-use HIV test products; it also agreed to distribute Uriscreen, a home test for urinary tract infections, developed by Israel's Healthcare Technologies. The firm broke a long-standing media barrier that year with its condom ads on network TV, aired primarily on late-night talk and comedy shows. Saddled with slow-growing, mature brands and facing expensive product development, the controlling Hoyt family began looking for a buyer the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the objections of investor "Super" Mario Gabelli (who owned almost 20% of the firm), in 2001 a group of investors led by
   <company id="42166">
    The Carlyle Group
   </company>
   and
   <company id="155601">
    The Cypress Group
   </company>
   bought out the firm. The group then sold Carter-Wallace's consumer products operations to a partnership formed by
   <company id="12975">
    Church &amp; Dwight
   </company>
   and
   <company id="99303">
    Kelso &amp; Company
   </company>
   . The remaining health care operations became MedPointe.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002, in order to focus on its pharmaceuticals unit, the firm sold its Wampole Laboratories diagnostic unit to Inverness Medical (since-renamed
   <company id="104552">
    Alere
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="161541">
    Meda AB
   </company>
   paid nearly $800 million in cash and stock for the company in 2007 and changed its name from MedPointe to Meda Pharmaceuticals. The acquisition, which included a large specialty sales force, gave Meda AB a foothold in the US market and added a complementary group of allergy and respiratory drugs and drug candidates to its portfolio. The two companies had previously collaborated on making and selling allergy drugs.
