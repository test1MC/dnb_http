   There's good karma for aging pharmaceuticals at SkyePharma. The firm uses its controlled-release drug delivery technologies for inhaled and oral drugs to produce more effective versions of already proven therapies. It makes money from partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies, who seek out SkyePharma's drug delivery expertise to enhance their existing products. The firm also develops proprietary compounds through collaboration or contract agreements, as well as on its own (though it seeks commercialization partners down the line). Its lead proprietary candidate is Flutiform, an inhaled treatment for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). SkyePharma is merging with
   <company id="160979">
    Vectura
   </company>
   .
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   SkyePharma's drug delivery technologies include Geomatrix and Geoclock controlled-release oral tablets, as well as dry-powder inhalers and CFC-free metered dose inhalers. It also specializes in technologies that enhance the water-solubility of therapeutic compounds. It uses these technologies to develop drugs in a number of areas, including cardiology, neurology, dermatology, pain management, and asthma.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once a drug that uses a SkyePharma technology reaches commercialization stages, the company receives royalty payments on sales of the drugs (on top of earlier licensing or development fees) from the partnering firms. Among its approved products are Paxil CR (a controlled-release version of
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   's antidepressant); Pulmicort HFA-MDI (a metered-dose inhaler using
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca's
   </company>
   asthma medication); Triglide (a lipid disorder drug developed with
   <company id="56875">
    Shionogi
   </company>
   ); and Requip Once-a-day (Parkinson's disease drug from GlaxoSmithKline).
  </p>
  <p>
   As the company's proprietary drug candidate Flutiform reached late-stage development, SkyePharma licensed international rights to
   <company id="100396">
    Kyorin
   </company>
   (in Japan), Mundipharma (Europe and other regions), and Sanofi (Latin America). US marketing rights for the compound were licensed to
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Labs
   </company>
   ; however, Abbott exited the partnership after the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   required additional trials on the drug in 2009 prior to granting US marketing approval. The drug's approval has been delayed in the UK market as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   SkyePharma has another early stage candidate aiming to treat diabetes, as well as a mid-stage candidate for sleep maintenance that is licensed to Somnus Therapeutics. Other candidates that the firm is developing for external partners target ailments such as rheumatoid arthritis and respiratory ailments.

  <p>
   In addition to its London headquarters operations, the firm conducts drug development efforts at its Swiss location. SkyePharma also provides contract manufacturing services to drug companies at its Lyon, France, production facility. The company sublicensed the Lyon facility to Aenova Group in 2011 to increase utilization of the space and to reduce capital expenditures; Aenova assists SkyPharma in providing scale-up and manufacturing services for newly approved or development-stage pharmaceuticals.

  <p>
   In 2016, SkyePharma agreed to merge with
   <company id="160979">
    Vectura
   </company>
   , another firm with a focus on breathing difficulties. The combined firm, which will be valued at more than Â£1 billion, will be led by current Vectura chairman and CEO (Bruno Angelici and James Ward-Lilley, respectively); SkyePharma shareholders will own 42% of the firm after the merger closes.

   Ian Gowrie-Smith, the one-man Australian drug company incubator, founded SkyePharma in 1995 after being removed from his previous startup,
   <company id="43055">
    Medeva
   </company>
   . Gowrie-Smith bought a shell company, sagging tentmaker Black &amp; Edgington, and gave it a jolt by merging his drug firm Krypton into it. The combined company, called SkyePharma, then completed its makeover the next year by buying Jago Holdings, a Swiss drug-delivery company (founded 1983). SkyePharma went public in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   From its beginnings SkyePharma concentrated on Jago's forte, innovative drug delivery (especially its GEOMATRIX controlled-release tablet). It set up alliances with pharmaceutical companies to create new methods of drug delivery that would have the added effect of lengthening a drug's patented lifespan, such as a controlled-release form of antidepressant Seroxat (also known as Paxil) from what is now GlaxoSmithKline.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 it began working with
   <company id="10509">
    Eli Lilly
   </company>
   to develop a form of Prozac that would reduce nausea and other side effects. The company received a setback when it bought a French factory and some of its products were delayed in getting to market. The next year it allied with Sepracor (later renamed
   <company id="11673">
    Sunovion
   </company>
   ) to develop improved asthma medicines and inhalers.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of an effort to raise its international profile, in 1999 SkyePharma bought Canada-based Hyal Pharmaceutical (controlled release and topical delivery systems) and US-based DepoTech. SkyePharma hit the jackpot when DepoTech's Depocyte cancer treatment delivery system (whose development costs had forced the company's sale) was approved by the FDA.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 SkyePharma made a deal with biotech giant Amgen to develop certain products using Depocyte's DepoFoam system. The following year, the company acquired Canadian drug-delivery firm RTP Pharma to increase its line of delivery systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of a strategy to reduce cash outflow, raise funds, and focus on its oral and inhaled lines, in 2007 SkyePharma sold its US-based injectable drug delivery business, SkyePharma Inc. (now
   <company id="42682">
    Pacira Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   ),including  its DepoFoam technology and cancer and pain drugs, to an investor group led by
   <company id="100023">
    MPM Capital
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="100047">
    OrbiMed
   </company>
   , and Sanderling Ventures.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 partner GlaxoSmithKline won FDA approval for Requip XL, a Parkinson's disease drug using SkyePharma's Geomatrix technology.
