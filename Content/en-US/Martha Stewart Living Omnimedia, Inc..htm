   Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia (MSLO) seems to prove the old adage that all publicity is good publicity. Legendary lifestyle maven Martha Stewart and her company, MSLO, have embraced the media spotlight, including Stewart's much ballyhooed sentence on federal criminal charges related to insider trading of stock. The domestic guru has her fingers in many revenue-generating pies that center around three business segments: publishing (magazines, books, websites), broadcasting (TV programs, satellite radio), and merchandising. The majority of MSLO's business comes from publishing activities, which are driven by its flagship magazine, Martha Stewart Living.

  <p>
   In 2015
   <company id="180914">
    Sequential Brands Group
   </company>
   agreed to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of MSLO. Sequential owns a portfolio of consumer brands in the home, fashion, lifestyle, and active categories.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's publishing segment has historically been its largest business segment. Publishing accounted for almost 60% of MSLO's revenue during fiscal 2014. The merchandising segment contributed 40% of total revenues in fiscal 2014 while the broadcasting business segment accounted for 2%.

   The Marthastewart.com website offers articles, recipes, and videos developed from several Martha Stewart brands, including its magazine content. In addition to the digital editions of its magazines, the company also produces numerous mobile and tablet applications to further distribution of its magazines and provide its content. MSLO has continued to expand its video distribution footprint through video distribution partners.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   MSLO reported $141.9 million in revenue for fiscal 2014. That was a decrease of $18.7 million compared to its fiscal 2013 revenue. The company's revenue has been declining since fiscal 2010. MSLO suffered a net loss of $5 million in fiscal 2014. That was $3.2 million more than the company claimed as a net loss in fiscal 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   MSLO had $2.7 million in cash from operations on hand at the end of fiscal 2014, up $4.2 million for the cash on hand during fiscal 2013.

  <p>
   MSLO relies heavily on the Martha Stewart brand. Her recipe: Mix equal parts Julia Child, Miss America, and P. T. Barnum; stir in liberal amounts of ambition and chutzpah; and serve with a flourish to a target audience that is hungry for a more gracious existence. Topics covered include cooking, entertainment, home, craft, holidays, weddings, organizing, and gardening.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has a partnership with
   <company id="10989">
    Meredith Corporation
   </company>
   . Meredith currently handles ad sales, circulation, and production of Martha Stewart Living and Martha Stewart Weddings magazines. The MSLO editorial team still creates all content for print and digital properties.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   A former model and stockbroker, Martha Stewart's entry into the commerce of gracious living can be traced back to 1972 when she launched a Westport, Connecticut, catering business. Culling her experiences as a caterer, Stewart published her first book,
   <i>
    Entertaining,
   </i>
   in 1982.
  </p>
  <p>
   The resounding success of
   <i>
    Entertaining
   </i>
   (the book has gone into 30 printings) propelled Stewart into the public spotlight. Kmart appointed Stewart as its lifestyle consultant in 1987, and in 1991 her notoriety led media giant
   <company id="43661">
    Time Inc.
   </company>
   to begin publishing the
   <i>
    Martha Stewart Living
   </i>
   magazine. Though beautiful to look at, the publication was expensive to produce; it did not achieve profitability until 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stewart rode the coattails of her magazine's success into a variety of other ventures. Dipping a toe into merchandising, she teamed with Sherwin Williams in 1992 to create a line of paints. Her syndicated TV show,
   <i>
    Martha Stewart Living,
   </i>
   debuted the following year. Stewart's first prime-time TV Christmas special (featuring Hillary Rodham Clinton and Miss Piggy) aired in 1995. Expanding further into merchandising, Stewart introduced Martha by Mail, a direct-mail catalog business, in 1995. Her weekly syndicated newspaper column began appearing in newspapers that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Frustrated with what she perceived as Time's inability to keep pace with the growth of her burgeoning empire and desirous of a hefty equity stake in her collection of companies, Stewart wrested her operation (then called Martha Stewart Enterprises) away from Time in 1997. Stewart's friend Sharon Patrick (and later a MSLO CEO) negotiated a buyout valuing the company at about $53 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Christening her new undertaking Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia (MSLO), Stewart wasted no time in expanding the company. MSLO soon entered into an alliance with Kmart to market the Martha Stewart Everyday line of merchandise (sales of the products helped temporarily revive the ailing retailer). Stewart started making appearances on
   <i>
    CBS News This Morning
   </i>
   that year, and later launched both her syndicated radio program and website.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 MSLO inked a deal with Zellers (a division of
   <company id="42417">
    Hudson's Bay Company
   </company>
   ) to market Martha Stewart Everyday Home products in the Canadian company's retail stores. When MSLO went public in 1999, Stewart greeted harried Wall Street traders with a breakfast of brioches stuffed with scrambled eggs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 MSLO spent $13 million for a 5% stake in
   <company id="101004">
    BlueLight.com
   </company>
   , an ISP and website launched by Kmart. (Kmart bought all of BlueLight.com in mid-2001.) In 2001 the company purchased the assets of Wedding List Holdings, a wedding gift registry service and retailer.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company struck a deal in 2001 with Japanese retailer
   <company id="52331">
    SEIYU
   </company>
   that significantly boosts MSLO's profile in Japan through selling Martha merchandise in 225 SEIYU stores. In addition the companies began jointly publishing a new Japanese language magazine called
   <i>
    Martha
   </i>
   . In 2001 the company also hooked up with
   <company id="11345">
    Shaw Industries
   </company>
   and Bernhardt Furniture Company for new lines of floor coverings and furniture. Kmart filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2002, and MSLO issued a statement that said it did not plan to break its contract with Kmart.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Internet/direct commerce division cut 40 positions in 2002, as part of a reorganization. Later that year the company unveiled its 200-unit Martha Stewart Signature Furniture line with Bernhardt Furniture.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stewart resigned as CEO and chairman in 2003 after being indicted on insider trading charges related to a biotech stock. She remained on the board and was given a new title, chief creative officer. Stewart was replaced by COO and president Sharon Patrick as CEO, and managing partner of ValueAct Capital Partners Jeffrey Ubben as chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   MSLO ventured away from pure Martha-oriented branding in 2003 when it launched a new magazine title,
   <i>
    Everyday Food
   </i>
   . In 2004 the company acquired
   <em>
    Body &amp; Soul
   </em>
   magazine from New Age Publishing and Dr. Andrew Weil's
   <em>
    Self Healing
   </em>
   newsletter from Thorne Communications for $6 million. These publications marked MSLO's first venture into the natural living category.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stewart was found guilty on all charges in 2004 after a federal jury deliberated for three days following a five-week trial. She was subsequently convicted for lying to investigators and obstruction of justice. Shortly after her conviction, Stewart stepped down from the board of directors.
  </p>
  <p>
   In September 2004 Stewart, who had been free pending appeal, asked to begin serving her jail sentence immediately in order to "put this nightmare behind me" and "reclaim my good life" and "return to my good works" as soon as possible. Following her request, she began serving her sentence that October at a prison in West Virginia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Patrick stepped down from her position in 2004 and was replaced by director Susan Lyne, a former
   <company id="10290">
    ABC
   </company>
   television executive. Ubben served as chairman until July 2004 when board member Thomas Siekman was named as his replacement. Charles Koppelman took over as chairman in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   While serving less than six months in jail, Stewart saw her company struggle: its stock price dropped, her TV show was put on hold, and for a time executives carefully tried to de-emphasize the "Martha-ness" of its products. Stewart completed the prison sentence in 2005, a time that her company referred to as her "homecoming." She then served another five months of house arrest, during which time she could leave her house only to work 48 hours a week at her company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stewart embraced TV as a medium as a means of rehabilitating her image. She struck a deal with Mark Burnett for a version of TV show
   <em>
    The Apprentice
   </em>
   , which aired in 2005 to underwhelming ratings although the show was priceless for promoting the MSLO brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company announced it would end most of its retail Web and catalog operations. In a broadcasting deal, the company announced a four-year deal with Sirius Satellite Radio (later
   <company id="46486">
    SIRIUS XM Radio
   </company>
   ) to create a 24-hour radio channel featuring cooking, gardening, and entertainment shows aimed at women. The channel debuted in 2005. MSLO then struck a deal with
   <company id="135429">
    Sony Music Entertainment
   </company>
   to release compilation albums for the holidays and special occasions.
  </p>
  <p>
   MSLO piled on another deal in 2005, announcing several television programs in development with
   <company id="43731">
    Discovery Communications
   </company>
   . The company also that year began working on a new show not starring Stewart, called
   <em>
    Petkeeping with Marc Marrone
   </em>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Stewart struck a deal with the
   <company id="56705">
    Securities and Exchange Commission
   </company>
   to settle her insider-trading case in which she paid $5 million and agreed to not serve as CEO or director of a public company for five years. Stewart assumed the title of founder and chief editorial officer at the company. Her former stockbroker, Peter Bacanovic, also settled with the SEC (for $75,000) and was banned from associating with a broker, dealer, or investment adviser.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company decided to discontinue its
   <em>
    Blueprint
   </em>
   magazine only a year after the title had launched; the "how-to" lifestyle magazine ceased publication in 2008. MSLO purchased the media and licensed properties of popular TV chef Emeril Lagasse for $45 million in cash and $5 million in stock in 2008. The deal consisted of Lagasse's media and licensed properties, including rights to the TV show
   <em>
    The Essence of Emeril
   </em>
   , syndicated episodes of the
   <em>
    Emeril Live
   </em>
   show on the
   <company id="138448">
    Food Network
   </company>
   , and a dozen cookbooks, as well as Emeril-branded spices, marinades, coffee, and other food products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lyne left the company in 2008. Koppelman was next tapped as the company's principal executive. MSLO's merchandising contract with Kmart ended in 2010. Stewart rejoined the company's board of directors in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early the next year The Hallmark Channel announced that it was canceling
   <em>
    The Martha Stewart Sho
   </em>
   w due to poor ratings. In more disappointing news for 2012, retail partner Home Depot stopped selling Martha Stewart Living-branded paints. Stewart was appointed nonexecutive chairman in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="180914">
    Sequential Brands Group
   </company>
   agreed to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of MSLO in 2015.
