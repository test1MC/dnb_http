   American Axle &amp; Manufacturing (AAM) is
   <company id="10640">
    GM
   </company>
   's right-hand man for driveline systems and forged products. AAM manufactures axles, driveshafts, and chassis components, mainly for light trucks and SUVs, but also for cars and crossover vehicles. Axles and driveshafts account for more than 80% of AAM's sales; chassis components, forged products, and other components make up the rest. The Tier 1 supplier gets nearly three-quarters of its business from GM; other customers include

   ,
   <company id="10334">
    Chrysler

   <company id="41853">
    VW
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   . AAM operates more than 35 manufacturing facilities around the world and earns 56% of its revenue from sales in North America.

  <p>
   The company has 37 manufacturing facilities in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and Pennsylvania, as well as Brazil, China, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Poland, Scotland, South Korea, Sweden, and Thailand. It has two plants in the UK, as well as engineering facilities in China, India, Germany, and South Korea. AAM is launching other plants in India and Thailand  to have better access to customers doing business in the Asia/Pacific region.

  <p>
   AAM has achieved significant growth over the years, with revenues climbing 6% to peak at $3.9 billion in 2015, its highest total in at least 10 years. The historic growth for 2015 was driven by an increase in production volumes for the North American light truck and SUV programs of GM and Chrysler, along with higher sales in support of Chrysler's AWD Jeep Cherokee.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits surged 65% from $143 million in 2014 to $236 million in 2015 due to the higher revenue coupled with a decrease in interest expenses. In addition, AAM's operating cash flows increased by 19% from 2014 to 2015.

   While its customer base includes a variety of manufacturers (

   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10334">
    Chrysler
   </company>
   . In 2015 almost 65% of its net sales came from GM, while Chrysler accounted for 20% of sales. AAM is the principle supplier of light truck and SUV rear-wheel-drive components to GM and Chrysler.

  <p>
   With most of its revenue being generated by just two companies, AAM is particularly susceptible to the effects that automotive market downturns and adverse business events have on GM and Chrysler. To reduce its vulnerability, AAM is diversifying its product portfolio to include driveline products for passenger cars, crossover, and commercial, and off-road vehicles made by a broader base of manufacturers.
