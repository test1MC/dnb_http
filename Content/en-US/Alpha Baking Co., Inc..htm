   Already a leading producer of baked goods, Alpha Baking has continued to grow its operations through acquisitions, such as Kreamo Bakers (South Bend, Indiana), organic bakery

    Natural Ovens

   (Manitowoc, Wisconsin), and National Baking Company and S. Rosen Baking (both Chicago). The company has also jockeyed for the assets of ailing Hostess Brands alongside

  <p>
   Amid the deep recession in the US, Alpha Baking was granted a five-year tax abatement in 2009 to purchase a replacement hamburger bun oven for its Indiana production center. The factory's existing oven was nearing the end of its 20-year lifespan and had failed to meet consistent baking standards for Alpha Baking's largest customer (accounting for more than 50% of revenue). To avoid job losses, local government officials agreed to tax abatement. The company has also been working to keep spending on its ingredients (such as wheat) under control as prices swing on the speculative and erratic commodity futures markets.
