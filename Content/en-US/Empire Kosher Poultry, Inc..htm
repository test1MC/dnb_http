  <p>
   Empire Kosher was founded in 1938 by Joseph N. Katz, an immigrant from Austria. Katz founded the company after he realized that the US Jewish population, which was moving out of urban areas into the suburbs and countryside, was having trouble finding kosher foods. He even sent for rabbis from Israel and Europe to ensure that Empire was following the 3,000-year-old Jewish dietary laws. The company grew and Katz invested in new equipment and began offering frozen, vacuum-wrapped poultry. By the 1950s, Empire was offering not only fresh and frozen poultry, but fresh deli meats and pizza. Katz retired from the company in 1992 and died in 2005.
