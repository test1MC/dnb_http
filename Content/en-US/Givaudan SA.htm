   World-leading flavor and fragrance company Givaudan is literally a tastemaker. The Swiss company takes inspiration from fruits and plants from around the globe, synthesizing them into flavours and fragrances. Givaudan's customers use these flavours in their products, which include cosmetics, perfume, beverages, dairy and savoury and sweet foods. The company is the largest flavour-maker in the world, and was founded in 1895.
  </p>

  <p>
   Givaudan operates two segments, Fragrances and Flavours. Fragrances is further divided into three global business units, namely Consumer Products, Fine Fragrances, and Fragrances and Cosmetics Ingredients, the largest being Consumer Products at 69% of segment revenue. Flavours is likewise subdivided, into Beverages, Dairy, Savoury, and Sweet Goods, of which Beverages is the largest at 37%, followed by Savoury at 34%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Flavours is narrowly the larger of the two segments, bringing in 52% of revenue. Fragrances accounts for the remaining.
  </p>
  <p>
   Givaudan runs a number of flavor-development programmes that research and develop new flavours, such as TasteEssentials, FlavourVision, ByNature and TasteTrek. The company uses its Virtual Aroma Synthesizer, a transportable device that creates aromas on the fly, to bring flavours directly to the customer.

  <p>
   The Group is headquartered in Vernier in Switzerland, and operates in over 100 countries. The Asia-Pacific region brings in the most sales, at 28%, followed by Europe (27%) and North America (23%). Latin America and Africa and the Middle East bring in the rest.

  <p>
   Givaudan supplies its products to the consumer goods industry. Customers of its fragrances include personal, home and laundry-care brands, as well as prestige perfumers.

  <p>
   Net sales dropped marginally in 2015 to CHF4.3 billion. Fragrance sales fell by CHF12 million, which was counterbalanced to an extent by a CHF4 million rise in Flavours sales. The fall in sales was a result of a decrease in demand of some global customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income increased 13% to CHF635 million due to reduced research and product development spend, and lower income taxes as a result of lower sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations grew 14% to CHF915 million because of a change in inventories and current liabilities.

  <p>
   Givaudan is struggling to overcome stagnant sales growth seen since 2012; sales have climbed only 3% since then, and in fact fell in 2015. Cosmetics fragrances is a target market for growth currently, and in the last couple of years Givaudan has acquired two companies in the sector: Soliance, a French active cosmetics company, and Induchem, a Swiss specialist in innovative functional ingredients. The company also inaugurated its new active cosmetic ingredients fermentation line in Pomacle, France.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is looking to emerging markets for growth opportunities as a response to sluggish conditions in Europe and North America. In 2015 it began construction of a flavor manufacturing site in Pune, India, and opened a fragrance creative centre and production hub in Singapore. It also opened a laboratory in Karachi, Pakistan, and opened offices in Guatemala, Cote d'Ivoire and Algeria.

  <p>
   In 2016 Givaudan agreed to acquire Spicetec Flavors &amp; Seasonings products from ConAgra Foods. Acquired for $340 million, Spicetec broadens the selection of Givaudan's spice and flavoring products used by meat producers, food service companies, and savory retail customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Givaudan acquired Induchem Holding AG and its affiliates for a purchase price of CHF93 million. Its portfolio of products is based on a wide range of innovative and highly functional active ingredients with expertise in fields such as biocatalysis, metagenomics and biochemical synthesis. Induchem was acquired to continue building Givaudan's active cosmetics ingredients business with science-based technologies.
