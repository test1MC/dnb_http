   Ice is hot stuff, especially when you own ice factories. Ice maker Reddy Ice owns many, and its proprietary technology lets grocery and convenience stores make and package their own ice automatically. With a daily ice-making capacity of about 18,000 tons, Reddy Ice is the largest US maker and distributor of packaged ice products. In addition to its Ice Factory machines, it sells ice in a variety of shapes (cubes, crescents, cylinders, and crushed) and sizes (ranging from four-pound bags to 300-pound blocks) to retail, commercial, and industrial customers in some 34 US states and the Washington, DC.

   The company has grown through acquisitions. The highly-fragmented, regional structure of the packaged ice and ice machine industries presents Reddy Ice with a pool of future acquisition opportunities. To regain its financial footing, Reddy Ice is focusing on inking deals with retailers that have not traditionally sold packaged ice, such as value-priced chains, as it expands its diverse customer base

   Following a recapitalization, Reddy Ice emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in mid-2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   The ice maker filed for bankruptcy in April 2012 citing weak consumer demand, reduced credit availability, and higher commodity costs. Despite selling a mind-boggling 1.7 million tons of ice and logging more than $328 million in revenue in 2011, Reddy Ice suffered losses of $69.5 million as it drowned in liabilities amounting to $516 million. During just 50 days in Chapter 11, the company cut its debt by about a third, or $145 million, closed on a $50 million revolving credit facility, and received $25 million in new equity. Post bankruptcy, the company is majority owned by affiliates of Centerbridge Partners.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following the confirmation of its plan of reorganization, the ice maker expects to emerge from Chapter 11 in late May. Australian investment firm Macquarie Bank has agreed to provide Reddy Ice with $70 million in debtor-in-possession financing to operate as it reorganizes and another $50 million to fund its post-bankruptcy operations. Meanwhile, Reddy Ice hopes to acquire fellow ailing ice maker Arctic Glacier, which filed for bankruptcy in February, helped by hedge fund and Reddy Ice major creditor Centerbridge Partners.
  </p>
  <p>
   In its effort to become the "Total Ice Solution," a vision for the company, the ice maker between 2003 and 2011 acquired 78 businesses for an aggregate purchase price of more than $162 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   An investigation by the Civil Fraud Division of the US Department of Justice concluded in 2011 with no action taken against Reddy Ice or its employees. The inquiry (launched in 2008) centered on possible conspiracy to fix prices and allocate markets in order to control prices for packaged ice.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was founded in the early 1900s.
