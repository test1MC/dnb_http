   Valerus partners with others to extend its reach globally. The Valerus-Geogas consortium, formed in 2008, is an equal partnership between Valerus and Geogas, a Brazilian company that specializes in the installation, operation, and maintenance of gas compression, treating and processing facilities. Its partner in Mexico, Nuvoil has more than 20 years of experience in the oil and gas industry. Nuvoil specializes in the installation, operation, and maintenance of gas compression, treating and processing facilities.

   In 2012 Valerus entered into an agreement with MCore Services, a civil contracting company based in Western Australia, to provide sales and marketing and construction services under the entity name of Valmec. MCore Services specializes in project management and takes on both remote and urban projects.

   Valerus has been expanding in the Middle East and Africa to take advantage of increasing natural gas use there. Companies in those regions used to burn off natural gas produced during petroleum refining but many are beginning to turn it into liquefied natural gas for use in home heating and as fuel.
  </p>
  <p>
   At home, Valerus operates an aftermarket and repair shop in Pennsylvania that carries a large spare parts inventory and offers mechanical, maintenance, and machinist services to oil and natural gas companies working the Marcellus and Utica shale fields.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Valerus and Brilex Industries partnered to make Valerus production equipment at the Brilex facility for deployment throughout the region. Previously, in 2012 Valerus opened a location in San Antonio, Texas, that provides sales support for the company's Eagle Ford and South Texas operations. It also expanded into Bridgman, Michigan, to boost the company's presence in the nation's north central region to meet growing demand for a wide range of aftermarket field application and repair services for natural gas transmission companies. The facility serves customers in Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota.

  <p>
   While Valerus is privately held and does not publish its financial results, the company is one of the largest providers of gas-processing solutions with revenue and asset equal to those of a mid-cap corporation. Based on its project backlog, Valerus projects that it will be able to maintain this momentum. The company has logged a 28% five-year compound annual growth rate from 2006 to 2011.
