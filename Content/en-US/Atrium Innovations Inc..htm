   Atrium Innovations believes you are what you eat -- or rather, what you take. The company manufactures and markets more than 1,300 vitamins, minerals, and nutritional supplements geared toward alternative health consumers. Its Pure Encapsulations line of vitamin and herbal extract capsules are a premium brand of natural hypoallergenic products, while products sold under the Douglas Laboratories label include customizable nutritionals and wellness products. The company sells products to health care professionals and consumers in more than 35 countries, primarily in North America and Europe, through its vast direct sales and marketing network. It also offers some contract development and manufacturing services.

  <p>
   While Atrium enjoys a global reach with primary operations in the US, Canada, Europe, Asia, and South America, the company generated 60% of its 2011 revenue through the sale of products in the US.

  <p>
   Atrium is focused solely on the health and nutrition market. The company is working to expand its product offerings through a tri-fold strategy of acquiring nutritional supplement companies; collaborating with research organizations to develop and in-license products that have dietary supplement applications; and internally developing new formulations and applications using existing ingredients.

  <p>
   Atrium has earned a broader geographic base and marketing network through acquisitions. Aside from developing, making, and marketing its own products, Atrium in 2011 laid the groundwork to become more vertically integrated when it acquired Robert et Fils, its largest distributor in Quebec. It also it expanded its portfolio of enzymes when it purchased Enzimas S.A., the Argentinian manufacturer of certain enzymes used in the production of the company's Wobezym products. The deals followed several purchases in 2010. The company added about 150 vitamins, minerals, and supplement products with the $11 million purchase of Trophic Canada in 2010, giving it the popular Trophic and Wild Rose brands. Atrium also acquired Belgium-based Minami Nutrition for €5.5 million ($7 million) to boost its omega-3 holdings and Toronto-based supplement maker Seroyal International and its Genestra, CoreLab, Pharmax, and Unda brands.

  <p>
   Buying Seroyal helped to boost Atrium's revenue some 16% in 2011 vs. 2010. Branded products and the favorable impact from the variation of the euro exchange rate over the US dollar also contributed positively to the company's bottom line. Revenues dipped slightly, however, due to a $9.2 million decrease in contract manufacturing sales. Operating expenses rose in 2011, but not enough to erode Atrium's 18% net income rise in 2011 vs. 2010 due to its increased revenue.

   Atrium gets its products in the hands of consumers through different sales channels. The company distributes its extensive portfolio of products primarily to the health care practitioner channel. It also sells its dietary supplements through health food and specialty stores in North America and Europe.

   , Atrium Innovations was spun off in 2006, after which it also changed its name from Atrium Biotechnologies to Atrium Innovations to better reflect its focus on specialty products.
