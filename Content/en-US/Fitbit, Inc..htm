   After eight years in business, Fitbit sold stock to the public in June 2015, raising $740 million. The stock was priced at $20 a share, higher than first planned. The company intends to use the proceeds for research and development, sales and marketing, capital expenditures, and possibly acquisitions.

  <p>
   While Fitbit develops the sensors, algorithms, and software for its products, the devices are made by contract manufacturers, mainly Flextronics. Fitbit devices range in price from about $60 for the entry level Fitbit Zip up to $250 for the Fitbit Surge that has the features of a GPS watch, heart-rate tracker, activity tracker, and smartwatch. The company updates its products through wireless connections. Fitbit also sells a WiFi-enabled scale, called Aria, that tracks weight, body fat percentage, and body mass index.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company offers premium services, for which customers pay extra. They include virtual coaching through customized fitness plans and interactive video-based exercise on mobile devices and computers. The company's open application programming interface (API) allows third -party developers to create health and fitness apps for Fitbit's platform.

  <p>
   Fitbit is headquartered in San Francisco and has another US office in Boston. It also has operations in Shanghai, Dublin, Hong Kong, Seoul, Minsk, New Delhi, and Tokyo.
  </p>
  <p>
   A solid three quarters of sales come from the US, with about 11% from the Asia-Pacific region, 8% from Europe, and 6% from the Americas excluding the US.

  <p>
   The company sells mainly through distributors and retail stores, which often have dedicated Fitbit displays. Wynit Distribution, Best Buy, and Amazon.com accounted for about 13%, 12%, and 11%, respectively, of the company's revenue in 2014.

  <p>
   Fitbit is in good shape financially on its top and bottom line. Its revenue took several big steps in 2014, jumping to $745.4 million in 2014 from $271 million in 2013. The number of devices sold more than doubled to almost 11 million in 2014 from about 4.5 million in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company posted a profit in 2014 as revenue growth more than covered increased spending on research and development and sales and marketing. Fitbit made $131.7 million in 2014, reversing a $51.6 million loss in 2013. R&amp;D expenses rose 94% to $54.2 million in 2014 from 2013 as the company more than doubled its R&amp;D staff. Sales and marketing expenses surged even more, to $112 million in 2014, a 317% increase from 2013. The company spent about $67 million on advertising in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations was about $18 million for 2014, compared to about $33 million for 2013.

  <p>
   While Fitbit is the leading fitness tracking device company, according to research organizations like International Data Corp. and NPD Group, the market for such devices is still young and the competition is mounting. Jawbone, Apple with its Apple Watch, Google, Garmin, Under Armour, Misfit, Xiaomi, and other companies are aiming for Fitbit's leadership in the fitness device race.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fitbit, of course, is not standing still. It plans to spend $150 million (much of it from raised by the IPO) on R&amp;D in 2015 to develop more sophisticated and responsive hardware and software. In sales and marketing, Fitbit faces the challenge of promoting the concepts of fitness and wellness and how devices help attain goal while also promoting its brand. An extensive sales and marketing push in 2015 including television commercials and print ads is to accelerate brand awareness.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has marked international markets as opportunities for expansion. About 25% of its revenue came from outside the US in 2014. Some of its sales and marketing budget will go toward expanding distribution channels retailers and strategic partnerships internationally. Fitbit will increase advertising and open more sales offices around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fitbit sees a solid business in corporate wellness programs in which companies often subsidize the cost of fitness equipment for employees. The market accounted for 10% of Fitbit's revenue in 2014, but the company intends to build up its offerings for wellness programs and expand it sales staff geared toward the market.
  </p>
  <p>
   A challenge for the company arose in early 2014 when some users of the Fitbit Force device reported allergic reactions from wearing the device. Fitbit recalled millions of Force units. Later in the year, it replaced with Force with the Fitbit Charge model.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also is involved in litigation with competitor Jawbone, which has accused Fitbit of stealing trade secrets and poaching employees. Fitbit has denied the allegations and the cases continue in state courts in California.

  <p>
   In March 2015, Fitbit acquired Fitstar, which produces interactive exercise videos for mobile devices and computers. Users can adjust the strenuousness of workouts based on feedback they provide. Pairing Fitbit devices with interactive videos could extend the active use of the Fitbit device over longer periods.
