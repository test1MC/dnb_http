   No one knows if Fred Wardell exclaimed "Eureka!" when he came up with the idea for a vacuum company, but that's what he named it in 1909. The vacuum cleaner company stood by its birth name until 2004, when it was rechristened Electrolux North America by Sweden-based
   <company id="41778">
    AB Electrolux
   </company>
   . The name change coincided with its parent's reacquisition of the Electrolux name in North America. The company makes and markets more than 130 vacuum models under brand names Electrolux, Sanitaire, Beam, and Eureka. Its products include uprights, canisters, built-in systems, hand-held and battery-powered vacuums, wet-dry vacs, stick models, and others. They're typically sold through

   AB Electrolux operates as part of its parent's Major Appliances North America division, which generated about 28% of total sales in fiscal 2012. The US brought in 27% of the Swedish parent's revenue, with Canada accounting for 4%.

   The company also manufactures original and replacement parts, including bags, belts, and filters for its models. Electrolux North America has manufacturing plants in Illinois and Texas.

  <p>
   Most of the vacuum cleaners parent AB Electrolux sells are branded as Eureka. Stiff competition in the vacuum-cleaner niche has the company looking to upscale customers to ensure it gets its share of the fast-growing sector. To this end, AB Electrolux launched high-end Electrolux-branded vacuum cleaners, complete with an ad campaign featuring morning TV personality Kelly Ripa. The company's strategy is to focus on the premium segment of the market to maintain its position in North America, as premium vacuum cleaners are more resilient to swings in the economy.
