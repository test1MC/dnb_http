   GSI Technology makes very fast chips. The company's specialized SRAM (static random-access memory) integrated circuits are used in high-speed networking equipment. Marketed under the Very Fast brand, its chips allow routers, switches, and other gear from the likes of
   <company id="41751">
    Alcatel-Lucent
   </company>
   and
   <company id="13494">
    Cisco Systems
   </company>
   to retrieve data at the speeds needed for broadband transmission. The fabless semiconductor company does most of its business through contract manufacturers, such as
   <company id="16141">
    Jabil Circuit
   </company>
   (20% of sales) and Flextronics (9%), and through distributors such as
   <company id="10151">
    Avnet
   </company>
   (20%) and Nexcomm (11%). Other top customers include
   <company id="46948">
    SMART Modular Technologies
   </company>
   (11%), which buys memory chips for products it makes on behalf of Cisco.

   GSI divides its marketing efforts between the US and developing countries, principally China and Malaysia. The company gets more than three-quarters of sales from outside the US. It has primary administration, design engineering, and testing facilities in the US and Taiwan, with additional sales and factory locations worldwide.

  <p>
   It doesn't hurt that the company has a blue-chip networking customer like Cisco, which (directly and indirectly) generates about 40% of the company's sales. Outside of the networking and telecommunications industries, GSI sells its high-performance chips to the automotive, military, medical, professional audio, and test and measurement markets.

   GSI relies on such silicon foundries as
   <company id="43493">
    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
   </company>
   and
   <company id="149921">
    Powerchip
   </company>
   to manufacture of its products. The semiconductors are primarily tested and packaged by
   <company id="43476">
    Advanced Semiconductor Engineering
   </company>
   (ASE).
