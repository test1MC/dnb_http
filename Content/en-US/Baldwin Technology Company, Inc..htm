  <p>
   William Gegenheimer founded the company in 1918 in his garage in the town of Baldwin on Long Island in New York. A former printer and press service technician, Gegenheimer invented a system for cleaning offset printing presses in minutes (a process that previously had taken hours). The company grew as it expanded its line of products.
