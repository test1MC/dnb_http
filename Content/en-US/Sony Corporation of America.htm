   In April 2012 parent Sony Corporation appointed new president and CEO Kazuo Hirai. Hirai subsequently introduced a new top management structure to speed up decision making and strategic execution. Among his appointments was Michael Lynton (chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment), who become CEO of SCA and its integrated entertainment businesses.

   Believing that entertainment is a bright spot in Sony Corporation's portfolio, the company supported the growth of its music business through a high-profile acquisition. An investor group led by SCA acquired

   , and David Geffen, among others. The acquisition brings together two of the world's leading music publishers, and Sony now controls the largest number of music copyrights in the industry, with more than 2 million. EMI Music Publishing will be folded into Sony subsidiary Sony/ATV Music Publishing, run jointly between Sony and Michael Jackson's estate. Sony/ATV represents the copyrights of Michael Jackson, The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder, Willie Nelson, and Queen, among many other legendary artists.
