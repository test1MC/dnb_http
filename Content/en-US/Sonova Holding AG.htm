   Pardon? Did you say Sonova Holding is among the world's leading makers of hearing aids? You won't have to ask that question with the products that this company develops, makes, and markets. Structured as a holding group, Sonova (formerly Phonak Holding) operates in two main segments focused on hearing instruments and hearing implants. Major brands include Phonak, Lyric, Acoustic Implants, and Advanced Bionics. Phonak specializes not only in hearing aids but in wireless communication and audiological systems for applications in security and studio recording. Sonova sells its products in more than 90 countries worldwide mainly through its wholesale and retail subsidiaries and through independent distributors.

   Other brands in the company's portfolio include Unitron, which offers a range of hearing products for the cost-conscious customer, and Sona, an integrated product and service concept that simplifies the ordering and fitting process for hearing professionals serving consumers. Sona is aimed at those with mild to moderate hearing loss.

  <p>
   Sonova's research and development plays an important role in maintaining diversity. Projects, sometimes conducted with university collaborators, involve trying to make technological advancements in audiology, communications, and signal processing, which can lead to enhancements to existing product lines or the development of a new product. Sonova is working, for instance, to develop its own middle ear implant under the Acoustic Implants brand.

   The company seeks strategic acquisition opportunities to maintain a healthy brand and product diversity. Sonova gained the Advanced Bionics brand of cochlear implants in early 2010 when it acquired US-based

    Advanced Bionics
   </company>
   for $489 million in cash. Advanced Bionics continues to operate as an independent business unit following the purchase. Its products are designed for those with profound hearing loss or deafness. The deal helped Sonova expand into the hearing implant market. However, in late 2010 the shiny new relationship hit a snag when Advanced Bionics issued a recall for its HiRes 90K cochlear implant device. Sonova has since reduced the unit's workforce and revamped its management.

   Mere days after completing its purchase of Advanced Bionics, Sonova acquired
   <company id="107523">
    InSound Medical
   </company>
   to add the Lyric brand and product family to its portfolio. Lyric is an extended-wear hearing aid placed deep in the ear canal and invisible from the outside. With this brand, Sonova is hoping to tap a younger generation of people with mild to moderate hearing loss who may have been reluctant to wear a visible hearing aid. Sonova paid an initial $75 million for InSound Medical, which then began operating as an independent business unit of Sonova. It also agreed to pay additional milestone payments of up to $275 million; however, in early 2011 the company reworked the agreement with former InSound shareholders by paying a lump $94 million to simplify its reporting structure and allow for integrated marketing of the Lyric system in the US.

   In 2015 the company agreed to buy wholesale hearing aid company Hansaton Akustic to expand its operations in Germany, which it hopes to make a key retail market.
