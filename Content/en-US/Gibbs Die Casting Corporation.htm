  <p>
   The trend toward lighter automobiles has led manufacturers to replace iron and steel parts with aluminum parts. To keep up with the demand for lighter-weight aluminum die castings for the auto market, Gibbs Die Casting is expanding its Comac Machining Division with new production lines at the Tech and Synchronous plants. The investment will cost the company $23 million.
