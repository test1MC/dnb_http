   For Costa, the lens is mightier than the pen. Formerly A.T. Cross, the company rebranded after selling off its writing instruments business and focusing on lenses and frames for sports sunglasses. It makes and sells and wide range of premium men's and women's sunglasses, billed as the "clearest lenses on the planet," for use in sports and adventure, primarily on the water. Costa's products -- which also include T-shirts, hats, and sunglasses accessories -- are available in retail locations across the US, including Dillard's, Dicks's Sporting Goods, and Academy Sports, as well as from vision care facilities.

   Alonzo Townsend Cross founded A.T. Cross Company in 1846 and in 1915 sold it to his top salesman, Walter Boss. In 1952 A.T. Cross introduced the gold-plated ballpoint pen now associated with the company. Boss' grandsons, Bradford and Russell, joined the firm in 1958 and 1961, respectively. A.T. Cross went public in 1971.

   The yuppies of the high-rolling 1980s picked up the premium-pen-as-status-symbol trend and sales skyrocketed. So popular were the company's pens that it had to battle cheap counterfeit versions made in Hong Kong. In 1983 the firm purchased Mark Cross (a retail chain of leather gifts stores) and Manetti-Farrow, a distributor of leather accessories, in 1987. A.T. Cross' sales peaked at nearly $250 million in 1989 before starting a steep slide.

   A.T. Cross introduced its heftier, more expensive Townsend line in 1991 to compete with Germany's

   pens. In 1993 Russell became CEO. That year he sold the company's Mark Cross subsidiary to

    Sara Lee
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 A.T. Cross formed its Pen Computing Group to develop pen-based products for use with electronics, and the following year it began selling a line of Cross-branded watches. Also in 1997 A.T. Cross signed an agreement with
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   to develop electronic note-taking products, which resulted in the 1998 introduction of the CrossPad, an electronic pen-and-pad combination. However, rapidly declining demand for premium pens in the US and Asia, together with significant marketing expenses for CrossPad, led to a loss that year. (The company discontinued the CrossPad business in 2001.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Russell unexpectedly announced plans to retire as chief executive, and in November 1999 David Whalen took over as CEO; Russell remained as chairman of the board. Also in 1999 A.T. Cross invested $2 million in
   <company id="52748">
    NeoMedia Technologies
   </company>
   to help market Cross' NetPen (an electronic pen that uses bar-code technology to link print articles to corresponding Web sites). In 2000 A.T. Cross cut 8% of its global workforce and consolidated its US and Irish distribution operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prompted by repetitive losses, A.T. Cross lessened its investment in NeoMedia in 2001. In 2002 A.T. Cross launched executive pens for the Tablet PC, as well as two signature pens featuring NASCAR champion Rusty Wallace.

   A.T. Cross acquired

   in April 2003 as part of a plan to grow its business in branded personal and business accessories. It added to its optical segment in March 2008 by acquiring the Native Eyewear business for about $17.8 million.
