   Johnson Controls (JCI) makes car batteries and interior parts for combustion engine and hybrid electric vehicles, as well as energy-efficient HVAC systems for commercial buildings. Products include instrument panels and a slew of electronics. OEM customers include

   The former Johnson Controls Inc. changed its business structure through its $16.5 billion mega-purchase of
   <company id="11516">
    Tyco International
   </company>
   in mid-2016. As part of the deal, JCI changed its name to Johnson Controls International plc and moved its global headquarters to Tyco's main office in Cork, Ireland. It switched headquarters to save as much as $150 million per year on taxes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, JCI spun off its global automotive seating components and systems operations into a publicly traded company called Adient Inc. in October 2016.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   JCI operates through 230 wholly- and majority-owned manufacturing or assembly plants. Its building efficiency business segment designs control systems and mechanical equipment, as well as services non-residential properties in about 52 countries. About 65% of this segment's sales are derived from HVAC products and control systems for construction and retrofit markets, and the other half from services. Branded products include the Metasys control system and York chillers. This segment is looking to such emerging markets as China and the Middle East for strong sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's power solutions business claims it is the largest lead-acid automotive battery producer in the world. JCI holds an edge over other battery companies, as it is not locked into an alliance with any specific automaker, allowing it to play the field. Its 60 manufacturing and assembly facilities are located in about 22 countries and produce lead-acid batteries, as well as AGM (absorbent glass mat) battery technology and lithium-ion batteries used in hybrid vehicles. About 75% of the company's batteries are sold in the automotive replacement sector, with the rest going to OEMs. Power solutions is ready to benefit from vertical integration for lead recycling and a shift in its product mix to AGM technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Automotive experience designs and manufactures interior products and systems for passenger cars and light trucks, including vans, pick-up trucks and sport/crossover utility vehicles. The business produces automotive interior systems for OEMs and operates approximately 230 wholly- and majority-owned manufacturing or assembly plants, with operations in 32 countries worldwide.

   . The company sells its control systems, mechanical equipment, and services through its extensive global network of sales and service offices. Some building controls, products, and mechanical systems are also sold to distributors of air-conditioning, refrigeration, and commercial heating systems throughout the world.

  <p>
   JCI's revenues dipped 1% to $36.9 billion in 2016 as it posted its first net loss in seven years. The marginal revenue decrease for 2016 was driven by lower sales from its automotive experience business and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $754 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The net loss of $847 million JCI suffered in 2016 was due to an increase in the income tax provision, additional separation and transaction costs, and mounting restructuring and impairment costs. Most of these costs were affiliated with the company's $16.5 billion purchase of Tyco International in late 2016.

   JCI is looking to streamline its business by selling and spinning off non-core operations. In late 2015 it completed the sale of its Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) business to
   <company id="42894">
    CBRE Group
   </company>
   for $1.5 billion. GWS is a worldwide provider of facilities management services.

   The company often grows its product portfolio through the use of acquisitions. In a sweeping move for the home-products industry, in early 2016, JCI purchased
   <company id="11516">
    Tyco International
   </company>
   for $16.5 billion. The combined company will boast revenues of up to $32 billion.

  <p>
   Professor Warren Johnson developed the electric telethermoscope in 1880 so that janitors at Whitewater, Wisconsin's State Normal School could regulate room temperatures without disturbing classrooms. His device, the thermostat, used mercury to move a heat element that opened and shut a circuit. Milwaukee hotelier William Plankinton believed in the invention and invested $150,000 to start production.
  </p>
  <p>
   The two men formed Johnson Electric Service Company in 1885. They sold the marketing, installation, and service rights to concentrate on manufacturing. Johnson also invented other devices such as tower clocks, and he experimented with the telegraph before becoming intrigued with the automobile and beginning production of steam-powered cars. He won the
   <company id="40507">
    US Postal Service
   </company>
   's first automotive contract, but never gained support within his own company. Johnson continued to look elsewhere for financing until his death in 1911.
  </p>
  <p>
   The renamed Johnson Services regained full rights to its thermostats in 1912 and sold its other businesses. During the Depression it produced economy systems that regulated building temperatures. Johnson Services became a public company in 1940. During WWII it aided the war effort, building weather-data gatherers and radar test sets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1960s Johnson Services began developing centralized control systems for temperature, fire alarm, lighting, and security regulation. The company was renamed Johnson Controls in 1974.
