   Transgenomic travels the uncharted frontiers of the human genome. Its Transgenomic Clinical Laboratories specializes in molecular diagnostics for cardiology, neurology, mitochondrial disorders, and oncology. Transgenomic Diagnostic Tools produces equipment, reagents, and other consumables for clinical and research applications in molecular testing and cytogenetics. The proprietary WAVE System is used for genetic variation detection in molecular genetic research and molecular diagnostics. Transgenomic Pharmacogenomic Services is a contract research laboratory that supports all phases of pre-clinical and clinical trials for oncology drugs in development. The company is merging with Precipio Diagnostics.

  <p>
   Transgenomic sells its instruments and services through its own sales force in the US, Canada, and Europe. The US is its largest market, generating more than 70% of sales. A network of distributors handles sales in other regions. Its primary customers include academic and medical research institutions as well as commercial pharmaceutical and biotech companies. The company manufactures the consumable products used with its instrument systems, and system components are made by third parties and assembled at its facilities in California and Nebraska.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company conducts its clinical laboratory services at facilities in New Haven, Connecticut and Omaha, Nebraska. Sales representatives in the US and Canada promote the services to physicians who send in samples for testing, as well drug development companies who use its clinical trial support services.

  <p>
   Transgenomic's business lines complement each other as the Pharmacogenomics Services division drives innovation which leads to kit production in the Diagnostic Tools segment and new tests in the company's Clinical Laboratories.
  </p>
  <p>
   Transgenomic's Pharmacogenomics Services division is a contract research organization (CRO) in Omaha, Nebraska. Its services support Phase II and Phase III clinical trials conducted by the company's pharmaceutical customers. The lab specializes in pharmacogenomic, biomarker, and mutation discovery research that serves global pharmaceutical and biomedical industries in areas of disease research, drug and diagnostic development, and clinical trial support.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's revenues dropped by 2% in 2012 due to an 18% decline in Pharmacogenomic Services due to a lower volume of genetic testing performed by its pharmaceutical company customers, and an 11% decline in Diagnostic Tools (despite an increase in instruments sold) as the result of lower distributor prices. Bioconsumable sales were down $0.7 million due to a lower volume of sales in Europe. The decline was partially offset by higher Clinical Laboratories' sales due to higher test volumes, and a slight shift towards higher priced tests driven by sales of recently launched NuclearMitome, C-GAAP, and ScoliScore test products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Transgenomic's net loss declined by 15% in 2012 as the result of the absence of expense on preferred stock and income generated from warrant revaluation due to the change in the fair value of common stock warrants.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company's strategy is to advance personalized medicine through its proprietary molecular technologies and clinical and research services. Transgenomic hopes to boost sales of its systems by entering new markets, including the Middle East and Asia, and through collaborations and product launches.
  </p>
  <p>
   To that end, in 2013 Transgenomic collaborated with
   <company id="12623">
    Amgen
   </company>
   to develop a CE IVD test to screen patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company gained CE IVD Mark registration in Europe for the diagnostic use of its proprietary WAVE MCE (Microchip Electrophoresis) System and the SURVEYORScan KRAS Kit for detecting DNA mutations. The WAVE MCE System is used to discover and detect genetic variation at close to 100% sensitivity for mutations (both known and unknown) and single nucleotide polymorphisms. These products are sold through its partnership with A. Menarini Diagnostic.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Transgenomic launched the REVEAL Kit, with ICE COLD-PCR mutation detection technology using the standard sequencing equipment already installed in laboratories worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012, the company also secured  Medicare coverage for C-GAAP, a comprehensive saliva test that accurately predicts a patient's response to Plavix.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company moved to strengthen its position in translational medicine services in 2012 by agreeing to acquire the biorepository assets of Gene Logic (an Ocimum Biosolutions company) for $250,000. The assets include 60,000 human tissue samples and extracted DNA specimens that cover cancer and other disease areas. By having this bank on hand, the company will be able to save time and money by not having to acquire specimens on a case-by-case basis.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company paid more than $4 million to acquire the global rights to Axial Biotech's ScoliScore test, a saliva-based genetic test for assessing the likelihood of scoliosis progression in adolescents.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ownership
  </p>
  <p>
   Randal J. Kirk owns more than 30% of the company; LeRoy C. Kopp more than 15%; and Kevin Douglas, 10%.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The purchase of the Familion genetic testing operations of
   <company id="13006">
    Clinical Data
   </company>
   for about $19 million in 2010 added molecular diagnostic tests for cardiovascular ailments and a pipeline of products under development for cancer drug response testing.
  </p>
  <p>
   At one point the company considered a business combination or sale of the company, but in 2007 chose to stop that process and remain independent. It then slimmed down its operations to reduce costs, and shuttered a manufacturing facility in the UK.
