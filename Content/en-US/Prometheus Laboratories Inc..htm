   If you've got fire in your belly, Prometheus Laboratories can help put it out. The pharmaceutical company markets several drugs that treat gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, gout, and kidney stones, as well as certain cancers and other medical conditions. Prometheus Laboratories markets its products mainly to US gastroenterologists and oncologists. It also pairs its drug offerings with a diagnostic testing products and services that helps doctors diagnose and treat gastrointestinal and oncology conditions. The company was acquired by
   <company id="41815">

   </company>
   in mid-2011.

  <p>
   In 2011 Nestlé agreed to purchase Prometheus through Nestlé Health Science, a new division formed earlier that year to deliver science-based nutritional treatments for medical conditions, for an undisclosed amount. Prometheus' diagnostic tests help Nestlé meet its goal of pursuing personalized medicine, and access to Nestlé's extensive resources help Prometheus conduct further R&amp;D efforts to extend its diagnostic product lines for gastrointestinal ailments, oncology, and other health conditions. The combined organization will also explore new areas of nutritional medicine and look to expand in additional geographic territories.

   , and Proleukin, a melanoma and kidney cancer drug licensed from
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis

   . The company also sells a number of diagnostic tests, some of which are licensed from drug companies such as
   <company id="153400">
    Rosetta Genomics
   </company>
   and
   <company id="52941">

   In addition, Promethius sells (but doesn't actively promote) several drugs outside its core focus area of gastrointestinal disease. Its Imuran, for instance, treats rheumatoid arthritis and can be used to prevent kidney transplant rejection. Ridaura also treats rheumatoid arthritis, and Helidac fights

   The company is working to expand further by licensing and acquiring more drugs, both late-stage investigational compounds and FDA-approved products, as well as diagnostic substances. It also conducts internal research and development on new products, as well as collaborative R&amp;D projects with partnering drugmakers. The company is focused on growing in the gastrointestinal and cancer therapeutic fields.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm believes that offering both diagnostics and therapies to the same customer base gives it a competitive edge and allows doctors to individualize patient care. The company is working to expand this business model into other therapeutic areas, and possibly to markets outside the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep expenses down, Prometheus Laboratories uses third parties to manufacture its products and to conduct clinical trials for its investigational compounds.
