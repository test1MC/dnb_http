   Axovant Sciences wants us to remain sharp as an ax, even in our golden years. The company acquires, develops, and commercializes novel therapeutics that treat neurodegenerative disorders. Its RVT-101 drug candidate (acquired from
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   , or GSK, in late 2014) is being tested as a treatment for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. Axovant plans to develop RVT-101 for use in combination with donepezil, which is marketed by
   <company id="56282">
    Eisai
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   under the Aricept brand name. Additionally, the company plans to acquire or develop other products for the treatment of dementia. Founded in October 2014, the company went public in a 2015 initial public offering.

  <p>
   Axovant raised $312 million in its IPO. It plans to use that money to fund its Phase 3 testing program for RVT-101 and for general corporate purposes, including the research and development of RVT-101 for other purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Roivant Sciences, which specializes in late-stage drug candidates; Roivant retained an 81% stake in Axovant after the IPO.

  <p>
   The company intends to conduct a Phase 3 program to confirm promising results in prior trials conducted by GSK. It will also explore the possibility that RVT-101 can treat patients with severe Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. If all goes well, Axovant plans to submit the candidate for approval in the US and Europe by the end of 2017; it then hopes to expand into Japan and other major markets.

  <p>
   Axovant has yet to earn any revenue on its products, and as of its fiscal year end of March 31, 2015, it had accumulated $21 million in debt. The company expects to incur significant losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future as it works to commercialize products to treat dementia.

  <p>
   The company's RVT-101 candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's, if found to be effective, has the opportunity to become a biopharmaceutical contender: There are an estimated 34 million individuals affected by the disease, and the majority of those have mild-to-moderate instances of the disease. Those numbers are projected to rise as the population ages.
