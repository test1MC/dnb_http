   At the heart of it, Regulus Therapeutics hopes to fight disease with leonine ferocity. It targets recently discovered microRNA (ribonucleic acid; miRNA), which is important in regulating cellular and biological functions. The company is developing anti-miRNAs that it believes will have the same sort of impact on drug discovery that monoclonal antibodies and biologics have. Through strategic alliances with
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi
   </company>
   , Regulus has three products in development. The candidates target chronic Hepatitis C (RG-101), kidney disease Alport syndrome (RG-012), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NASH) for patients with type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes (RG-125).

  <p>
   The three anti-miRNAs are in Phase 1 and Phase 2 development. Regulus also has several programs it is working to develop in the areas of oncology, fibrosis, and orphan disease, but the company has no commercialized product as of yet.

  <p>
   Regulus has administrative offices and a research laboratory in San Diego.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates in the US but does business with companies based in France (Sanofi) and the UK (GSK and AstraZeneca). Once its products are developed, they will be sold worldwide by Regulus' collaborators.

  <p>
   The development-stage company makes money from its strategic alliances and though it still operates at a loss while spending more on R&amp;D than it brings in, its net losses have been shrinking. At the same time, revenues have grown as Regulus hits product milestones. In 2015, revenue more than doubled, rising 171% to $21 million as a result of its expanding partnership with AstraZeneca, as well as a newer collaboration with
   <company id="13209">
    Biogen
   </company>
   . Net loss decreased by $1 million to $56 million that year. An increase in receivables and prepaid expenses led to an increase in operating cash outflow, which rose $10 million to $50 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   As of December 31, 2015, Regulus had an accumulated deficit of $191.5 million.

  <p>
   Going forward, the company plans to continue developing its candidates while looking for additional ones as it strives to stay ahead of the miRNA field. It also intends to continue pursuing strategic alliances and create companion diagnostics applicable to miRNA as well as monoclonal and small molecule antibodies.

   In 2014, Regulus entered into a new collaboration and licensing agreement with Biogen to concentrate on microRNA markers for multiple sclerosis. Sanofi is also partnering with the company to discover microRNA treatments in the areas of oncology and orphan disease.
