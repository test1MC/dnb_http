   Cerus preaches the power of purity. The firm develops blood purification systems under the name INTERCEPT that kill bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens in donated blood in an effort to improve the safety of blood transfusions. Its INTERCEPT Blood Systems for platelets and plasma are approved for sale in some European and Middle Eastern countries, where they are marketed directly to customers through subsidiary Cerus Europe. It also sells to the Commonwealth of Independent States. The company has also received regulatory approval to sell its INTERCEPT plasma and platelets products in the US (in 2015) and in other countries. Additionally, Cerus has a system for red blood cell purification in clinical development.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The INTERCEPT system is designed to target and inactivate blood-borne pathogens, such as viruses (for example, HIV, West Nile, SARS, and hepatitis B and C), bacteria, and parasites, as well as potentially harmful white blood cells, while preserving the therapeutic properties of platelet, plasma, and red blood cell transfusion products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Studies on the company's red blood cell system have been right on track, and Cerus plans to apply for CE approval in the second half of 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   To pursue its goals, the firm partners with other medical product specialists, including Aduro BioTech and

    Fresenius Kabi
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has offices in the US and the Netherlands.
  </p>
  <p>
   It sells its products in the US, Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Middle East, and certain other locations around the world. Sales in France account for some 25% of Cerus' total revenue.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company sells its platelet and plasma systems through its own direct sales force and through distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cerus works to sell its products in more markets. To this end, the company has to employ an aggressive marketing strategy paired with competitive pricing. It serves blood collection organizations, such as national blood transfusion providers or the Red Cross, with France, Germany, and England accounting for the most sales in Europe. Significant customers include Etablissement Francais du Sang (with 25% of 2014 sales).
  </p>

  <p>
   In 2014, sales of Cerus' disposable kits fell, which contributed to an 8% revenue decline to $8 million. The negative impact of currency exchange rates also hurt the company. This decline was a bit of a turnaround after the company had seen years of rising earnings; it was partially offset by both an increase in average product selling prices and growing sales of illuminator devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cerus has been losing money for the past few years as it spends for research and development of pipeline products. After losing $43 million in 2013, the company was able to reduce its loss to $11 million in 2014. As of the end of that year, its accumulated deficit totaled $542 million. Cerus expects to continue to incur financial losses until INTERCEPT gains more widespread market acceptance.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm has also reported operating cash outflows for the past five years. Outflow increased 49% to $40 million in 2014 due to changes in accrued liabilities and other assets.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Cerus operates in an extremely concentrated market dominated by a few blood collection agencies and without a lot of customers to go around (just three customers account for about half of all of the company's income). This means that Cerus has to stay on its toes with regard to getting its products approved to be sold in more markets. It also has to have an aggressive marketing strategy and competitive pricing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company received US
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval for its INTERCEPT plasma and platelet systems. It was given Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) supplement status for the system in the treatment of Ebola and to address chikungunya and dengue fever blood safety risks.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to further expand geographically, in 2014 the company submitted its Medical Device license application to Health Canada for its plasma system. That year it also signed a deal with
   <company id="186792">
    Nipro
   </company>
   's pharmaceutical division to develop technology to support commercial implementation of the INTERCEPT System.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Belgian Red Cross Flanders signed a five-year agreement with Cerus to purchase the INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets. The Red Cross unit supplies 37,000 platelet components to the Flemish region of Belgium. Two years later, the American Red Cross signed a multi-year purchase agreement for the platelet and plasma systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other agreements have been struck with customers including LifeShare Blood Centers and

  <p>
   The company's product line used to include a range of immunotherapies, including Listeria and KBMA vaccine platforms, until a few years ago when Cerus decided to spin off the immunotherapy division to a newly formed company named Anza Therapeutics. The spinoff was funded by venture capital firms; Cerus retained a 15% stake in Anza. A lack of funding caused Anza to cease operations in 2009. Later that year, Cerus entered into a three-way license agreement with Anza and Aduro BioTech, through which Anza transferred all of its intellectual property to Aduro. Cerus received a 10% stake in Aduro, a 1% royalty on all future product sales related to the transferred technology, and about $500,000 in cash from Aduro.
