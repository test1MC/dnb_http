   Owen Mumford gets to the point. The family-owned company designs and manufactures medical devices and disposables that include a variety of injection-based drug delivery systems, blood sampling equipment, neuropathy testers, and sexual health care devices. Its Autopen® line of insulin injectors use a side-mounted slide instead of a plunger, which is part of a design that is meant to minimize pressure and bruising. The company also makes Unilet® lancets in a number of sizes for use in blood sampling and testing. Owen Mumford also offers custom design services and forms partnerships to create new products.

   The company acknowledges that growing stresses on the health care system will make self-management vital for such conditions as diabetes. To provide advancements in this area, Owen Mumford works from concept to commercialization with its own team as well as with health care professionals and pharmaceutical and diagnostic partners to develop custom-made and private-label medical devices.
