   The specialty orthopedic company reported sales of $242.3 million in 2013, a 50% decline versus 2012. The plunge in sales was due to the sale of its hip and knee implant business, partially offset by a 41% increase in sales in Europe year over year stemming from the acquisition of UK-based WG Healthcare and France's Biotech International. When adjusted for the sale of the hip/knee implant unit (OrthoRecon), sales rose 13% in 2013 versus 2012. Sales of foot and ankle product rose 23%, while both the upper extremity and biologics segments posted 1% declines.

  <p>
   Wright Medical exited the hip and knee implant business with the sale of OrthoRecon as part of its strategy to transform itself into a profitable, high growth, pure play medical technology company. In time, Wright hopes to replace the substantial revenue and cash flow forfeited by the sale of OrthoRecon by ramping up high-margin revenue streams from extremities and biologics products. The company its overseas presence and product lines at home via acquisitions.

Also in Europe, Wright acquired France's Biotech International, another extremities company, for approximately $75 million in cash and stock, plus additional milestone payments of up to $5 million cash payable in 2014 and 2015.

The $380 million deal ($190 million in cash and stock, plus additional milestones of up to $190 million) is intended to combine BioMimetic's biologics platform with Wright Medical's established product portfolio and sales force to push growth opportunities in the extremities market, specifically foot and ankle fusions. BioMimetic's Augment bone graft is approved in international markets and is pending approval in the US.
