   There's no such thing as "just paper" at Appleton Coated. The Altima Gloss &amp; Silk product line is acid-free with a finish that allows for sharp images. Utopia has five paper grades: Premium (metallics), One X: Green (made with recovered fabric), and Utopia One, Two, and Three. Utopia also makes paper for textbooks, trade publications, catalogs, inserts, and technical publications.

   The Curious Collection offers more unique products -- some made of paper and fabric and others of printable plastic. Finishes include glittery, iridescent, or translucent, while other sheets are see-through, have a fabric feel, or are bendable and waterproof. C1S Litho is designed for the packaging, label, and book jacket markets. Utopia Digital is used for offset, laser, and color copier applications, while Direct Mail is used for print communications.
