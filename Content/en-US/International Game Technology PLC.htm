   International Game Technology (IGT) has hit the jackpot in the casino gaming business. The company is the world's largest gaming machine manufacturer, with a product portfolio that includes traditional reel slot machines, video slots and video poker, along with progressive payout machines. IGT services both company-owned and casino-owned gaming machines at casinos all over the world. The company also makes casino management software systems for tracking activity on the casino floor, as well as multiplayer game software and customer relationship management (CRM) systems.

   IGT sells products mostly in North America, but also serves international customers in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East, and South America.

  <p>
   IGT generates revenue through product sales of proprietary gaming equipment and service agreements under which the company collects recurring fees, some of which are based on the amount of money wagered on its machines. The rest of its business comes from more traditional product sales and service contracts.

That was also down a little compared to the $272 million IGT reported for net income the prior fiscal period.

  <p>
   A key strategic initiative of IGT is to invest heavily in product development to make games that will attract attention on the crowded casino floor.  It has a variety of game themes designed to appeal to game players, including several based on licensed brands and entertainment properties such as popular game shows
   <em>
    Wheel of Fortune
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    The Price Is Right
   </em>
   . IGT has also introduced a multigame slot system (MultiPLAY) that allows gamblers to play up to four slot games at once with progressive payouts. In addition, the company is putting emphasis on developing and expanding its casino information management systems and server-based gaming platforms that help operate multiple gaming machines.
