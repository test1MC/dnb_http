   Koroseal Interior Products (formerly RJF International) has its products against the wall -- literally. The company makes specialty engineered polymer products used in assisted living, decorative, education, hospitality, industrial, transit, and office products settings. Its range of offerings include wall coverings, protective coatings, flexible bonded magnetic strips, flooring, and guard rails. The company also makes PVC strips and sheets for transparent and opaque strip doors and industrial barriers. Their applications include loading docks, interior plant passageways, even freezer doors. The former RJF International was acquired by Peak Rock Capital in 2014 and was rebranded as Koroseal Interior Products.
