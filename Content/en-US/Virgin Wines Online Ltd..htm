   UK oenophiles and online-ophiles alike can shop their thirst away at Virgin Wines. The company operates a website that serves as a wine marketplace. Virgin Wines sorts its wines primarily by wine style or taste, rather than by region. The company's strategy, it believes, makes its product more accessible to the everyday wine drinker. While conducting the majority of its delivery business online, Virgin Wines boasts a staff of wine advisors that also provide phone consultation and wine tips to customers. The company is an independent entity, but works closely with the
