   Kadmon hopes to one day rein in a few of the world's most prevalent diseases. A biopharmaceutical company, Kadmon develops drug candidates to treat cancer, infectious diseases, and genetic conditions. It markets and distributes ribavirin products for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. In late-stage development, as well as in pre-clinical and early-stage trials, its pipeline includes treatments for colorectal, liver, lung, breast, and pancreatic cancers. Other candidates target high blood pressure and metabolic conditions (through a late-stage drug that blocks the absorption of cholesterol and fatty acids). Kadmon was founded in 2010 by biotech entrepreneur Samuel Waksal. The company took itself public in mid-2016.

  <p>
   Kadmon raised $75 million in its initial public offering. The company plans to use proceeds raised to advance its pipeline of candidates through clinical studies.

  <p>
   Among Kadmon's most advanced candidates, KD025 is being investigated for autoimmune, fibrotic, and neurodegenerative diseases. Tesevatinib is another late-stage candidate for the treatment of tumor growth, kidney disease, and drug resistance. KD034 is also being tested for the treatment of the rare genetic affliction Wilson's disease.
  </p>
  <p>
   Subsidiary Kadmon Pharmaceuticals is the group's commercial arm. It markets and distributes the portfolio of ribavirin products, co-promotes a product for chronic weight management, and distributes treatments for chorea and cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis.

  <p>
   The group's largest earner is its portfolio of ribavirin products, but those earnings have declined over the past couple of years as new treatments for hepatitis C have hit the market. Therefore it is key to the Kadmon's survival to release new products from its development pipeline. KD025 is being investigated for its efficacy against psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, scleroderma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

  <p>
   Samuel Waksal's career in the biotech industry has been marked with the highest highs and the lowest lows. On the upside, he founded
   <company id="15468">
    ImClone Systems
   </company>
   (sold to Eli Lilly in 2008), which successfully developed cancer drug Erbitux. Waksal's low point came with his involvement in the highly publicized insider trader fiasco with friend Martha Stewart, which landed him in prison for five years in the mid-2000s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Having put his past behind him, Waksal set up Kadmon and acquired Three Rivers Pharmaceuticals and its drug development and manufacturing base. The deal included Three Rivers' pipeline that, in effect, gave Kadmon a more established drug development pipeline than most biotech startups are accustomed to.
