   Subaru of Indiana Automotive (SIA) hopes your Legacy will include a Tribeca parked Outback, all of which are made by SIA for the North American market. Boasting an annual capacity of more than 300,000 units per eight-hour shift, SIA is a wholly owned subsidiary of
   <company id="52361">
    Fuji Heavy Industries
   </company>
   . The Indiana subsidiary also builds Toyota Camrys through a joint venture that Fuji Heavy Industries has with
   <company id="41889">
    Toyota Motor
   </company>
   . Sister company
   <company id="113548">
    Subaru of America
   </company>
   handles marketing and distribution of company cars in the US. Half of them are made by SIA. The only Subaru manufacturing plant in North America, SIA makes about 1,200 vehicles a day.

   The company operates under the Automobile segment of
   <company id="52361">
    Fuji Heavy Industries
   </company>

  <p>
   Because Subaru sales have been increasing in North America, especially for the Outback and Legacy, SIA is spending about $75 million to expand its plant by 52,000 sq. ft. in a project that is scheduled to conclude in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is also focusing on increasing the production capacity of SIA vehicles to 200,000 units a year by 2015. Through an additional $400 million investment, the parent company's plan is to expand SIA production capacity to 300,000 units a year in 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its expansion plans, SIA sends engineers to Japan to participate in a new automobile development planning.
