   Little Debbie smiles up from North American lunch bags. McKee Foods' Little Debbie is one of the nation's best-known brands of snack cakes, named for and featuring the smiling face of the 4-year-old granddaughter of the company's late founders: O. D. and Ruth McKee. The company also makes ready-to-eat Sunbelt breakfast cereals, granola, creme-filled cookies, crackers, and snack bars. It boasts more than 100 varieties of Little Debbie-brand products. Adding to its menu of snacks, McKee acquired the regional Drake's snack cake brand from bankrupt Hostess Brands in 2013. McKee's baked goods are sold in the US, Canada, and Mexico. Founded in 1934, the bakery is still owned and operated by the McKee family.

   In addition to Little Debbie, the company's brand names include Sunbelt (granola bars, cereals, and fruit-flavored snacks), and Heartland and Fieldstone Bakery (cookies, foodservice only). McKee also owns Blue Planet Foods, which makes granola cereals and preformed crumb pie crusts sold under the Heartland brand name, and Drake's Cakes (acquired in 2013).

   After acquiring the Drake's snack cake brand following the failure and breakup of Hostess Brands, McKee initially relaunched the four most popular cakes -- Devil Dogs, Coffee Cakes, Ring Dings, and Yodels -- in the Northeast in late 2013.

   Product development is key in the highly competitive snack market, and McKee Foods steadily puts out offerings to keep it in the forefront of the snack-food world. It has introduced Little Debbie Chocolate Cupcakes in keeping with the popularity of cupcakes (and also to compete head-to-head with rival

   ). McKee also offers smaller versions of its Little Debbies. Containing only 100 calories each, they are aimed at consumers watching their weight. Family packs of individually wrapped treats and consistently low prices also drive sales.

  <p>
   During the Depression, O. D. McKee began selling another baker's nickel cakes from his car. He decided he could make more money selling his own cakes, so in 1934 he and his wife, Ruth, bought a small Chattanooga, Tennessee, bakery. O. D. went on the road to sell the bakery's products, while Ruth oversaw the company's operations. They later sold that bakery to Ruth's father and started a new one in Charlotte, North Carolina. The McKees were ready to retire in the early 1950s when Ruth's brother, who had inherited the Chattanooga bakery, became ill. The McKees returned to Tennessee and took over operations, moving the bakery to Collegedale, near Chattanooga, in 1957.
  </p>
  <p>
   The McKees launched a new brand, Little Debbie, in 1960 named for their granddaughter Debbie. The next year the company began a profit-sharing program. In 1971 son Ellsworth became president. A decade later the company introduced the Sunbelt brand, and over the years McKee Baking opened plants in Arkansas and Virginia. When Ruth died in 1989, the company's long-haul drivers were the honorary pallbearers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991 the company changed its name to McKee Foods. O. D. died in 1995; Ellsworth became chairman in 1996, passing the CEO post to his brother Jack. That year McKee Foods began selling its products in Canada. In 2002 the company expanded its plant in Gentry, Arkansas.
