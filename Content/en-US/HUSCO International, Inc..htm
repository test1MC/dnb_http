  <p>
   HUSCO was founded in 1950 as Hydraulic Unit Specialty Company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The modern HUSCO story began in 1983 when Agustin Ramirez, Jr. was assigned to develop a strategic plan for HUSCO, then a subsidiary of Koehring/AMCA. Ramirez recognized the tremendous growth potential that could be unlocked by separating HUSCO from AMCA and allowing the company to market its products to other major OEMs of off-highway equipment. As a result Ramirez led a management buyout of HUSCO in 1985.
