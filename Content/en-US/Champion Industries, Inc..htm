Through more than a dozen operating units, Champion Industries prints books, brochures, business cards, business forms, posters, and tags, including complex four- to six-color products. Printing accounts for the majority of sales. The company also sells a wide range of office products and office furniture that it orders from manufacturers, and provides office design services. Champion Industries operates primarily in regional markets east of the Mississippi and publishes

   John Chapman founded Chapman Printing in 1922. In the following decades the firm grew at a glacial pace, and when Harrah and Reynolds Corp. (led by Marshall Reynolds) bought it in 1964, it was making $3,000 on total sales of $103,000. Chapman Printing grew through internal expansion and by acquisition. Purchases included the Transylvania Co. (1983) and Stationers, Inc. (1987).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 Reynolds, as chairman and CEO, changed the company's name to Champion Industries; he took it public the following year. Bankrolled by the proceeds of the IPO, the firm revved up its acquisitions program, following the consolidation trend in its fragmented industry. Champion Industries subsequently bought five other printing businesses in its existing markets in Louisiana, Mississippi, and West Virginia; it also entered new areas, including Maryland and Tennessee.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reynolds set the company on the path to dominance in the South and Southeast by consolidating its position within individual markets. In 1996 Champion's Bourque Printing division bought the bankrupt E.S. Upton Printing Co. (founded 1889). Champion Industries bought printing company Interform and color printer Blue Ridge Printing in 1997. The next year it acquired Rose City Press, a West Virginia office products company, and Capital Business Equipment, an office interior design services company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Champion Industries purchased Louisiana-based office products firm Diez Business Machines and added Louisiana-based Transdata Systems to its acquisitions list in 2001. Its Consolidated Graphic Communications subsidiary purchased Integrated Marketing Solutions, a direct sales business, in 2003 in order to gain that company's customer database.
  </p>
  <p>
   Champion Industries in 2004 acquired West Virginia-based Syscan, a business forms and office products supplier, and Ohio-based Westerman Print. The company acquired
   <em>

   </em>
   newspaper in 2007, to complement its operations.
