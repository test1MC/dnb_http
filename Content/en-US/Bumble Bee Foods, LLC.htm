   Bumble Bee Foods doesn't make honey. But it does make a honey of a product line, which includes canned tuna, crab, salmon, shrimp, clams, sardines, and other canned and pouched seafoods. Brands include Bumble Bee, of course, along with Beach Cliff, Brunswick, Snow's, and King Oscar. When combined with its Canadian operations, Clover Leaf Seafoods, Bumble Bee claims that it outranks its archrival
   <company id="105939">
    StarKist
   </company>
   as the largest canned seafood company in North America by sales. Bumble Bee has canning operations in Canada and the US. Its customers include retail food stores and foodservice providers. Founded in 1899, Bumble Bee Foods is owned by London-based private equity firm
   <company id="139170">
    Lion Capital
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   The food firm ranks as North America's largest branded shelf-stable seafood company. Its full line of canned and pouched tuna, salmon, sardines, and specialty seafood items are marketed in the US under the brands Bumble Bee, Brunswick, Sweet Sue, Snow's, Beach Cliff, Wild Selections, and Bumble Bee Superfresh. In Canada, Bumble Bee Foods markets its products under the Clover Leaf label.
  </p>
  <p>
   A proposal from Thai Union Thai Union Frozen Products to buy Bumble Bee was scrapped in 2015 on regulatory concerns that the deal would hurt competition in the seafood market. The proposed price had been $1.5 billion.

   Canned tuna may seem a humble food to you, but Bumble Bee Foods has found success marketing premium canned tuna and salmon under fancy sub-brand names, such as Prime Fillet Chipotle and Olive Oil, Prime Fillet Sundried Tomatoes and Olive Oil, and Prime Fillet Jalapenos and Olive Oil.
  </p>
  <p>
   Indeed, in 2014 the company established a partnership with tuna catcher and processor Sapmer. The French company is internationally known for its high-quality standards and sustainable fishing practices. Bumble Bee Foods, as part of the alliance, is looking to move into the premium foodservice niche and deliver sashimi-quality frozen tuna to restaurants and food retailers throughout North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   As it works to chase after the growing Hispanic community, Bumble Bee Foods in 2013 partnered with Hispanic celebrity chef Doreen Colondres, who is helping the tuna processor extend its successful "BeeWell for Life" brand philosophy.

  <p>
   To extend its reach in retail and foodservice channels, Bumble Bee Foods acquired Tampa, Florida-based Anova Food, which specializes in the global sourcing of wild-caught and farm-raised fin fish.

   Private equity firm Centre Partners Management sold Bumble Bee Foods to Lion Capital in 2010. The sale valued the seafood packager at $980 million and was made in partnership with members of Bumble Bee's senior management. Under Lion Capital's ownership, Bumble Bee Foods remains headquartered in California and continues to pursue its expansion strategy in the North American and global seafood markets.

  <p>
   Connors Bros. purchased the then-named Bumble Bee Seafoods from
   <company id="111042">
    ConAgra
   </company>
   in 2004. Connors also owned Clover Leaf Seafoods and Brunswick canned sardines and combined them with Bumble Bee.
  </p>
  <p>
   Happily at the top of the US's seafood canning heap, Bumble Bee has turned its attention to other canned proteins. In 2005 it purchased the shelf-stable meat business of
   <company id="104156">
    Sara Lee Foods
   </company>
   , which included the Sweet Sue brand of chicken products and a license to sell Bryan shelf-stable meats. The company also acquired food processor Castleberry/Snow, located in Augusta, Georgia. With the acquisition came the regional brands Austex, Castleberry, Doxsee, Prudence, and Snow's.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 a lawsuit surrounding mercury levels in tuna brought by the California attorney general against Bumble Bee (along with StarKist and
   <company id="105945">
    Chicken of the Sea
   </company>
   ) was dismissed, the court ruling that mercury warning labels are not necessary on canned tuna products. That year Bumble Bee created a supply arrangement with Thai tuna processor, Sea Value Company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In December 2010 UK investment firm Lion Capital acquired Bumble Bee Foods from Centre Partners in a deal valued at $980 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Streamlining its operations, Bumble Bee in February 2011 sold its sardine processing facility in Maine to Massachusetts-based Live Lobster Co. The facility was the last full-time sardine cannery in the US and had been operated by Bumble Bee from 2004 until its closure in early 2009. In June 2012, the company closed its cannery in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico after 50 years in business, resulting in the loss of 260 jobs there.
