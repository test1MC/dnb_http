   As important as the blood running through your veins is the oxygen it carries. Masimo knows that and makes tools that monitor arterial blood-oxygen saturation levels and pulse rates in patients. The company's product range, which is based on Signal Extraction Technology (SET), offers pulse oximeters in both handheld and stand-alone (bedside) form. Product benefits include the provision of real-time information and elimination of signal interference, such as patient movements. In addition to general product sales, Masimo licenses SET-based products to dozens of medical equipment manufacturers, including

        <p>
   While the Americas account for about three-fourths of its product sales, Masimo is working to grow its operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and the Middle East. It has operations in about 25 countries.

   The company markets its products globally through direct sales representatives and distributors. Customers include hospitals, alternative care entities, OEMs, and wholesalers. Two distributors,

   and
   <company id="12894">
    Cardinal Health

   , each account for more than 10% of annual sales.

        <p>
   Advertising costs for fiscal 2012 was about $9.5 million, compared to $5.6 million in 2011. Masimo is expanding marketing programs to build consumer brand awareness through means including print and digital advertising, trade show participation, and direct mail campaigns. It also distributes publications and sponsors seminars to educate medical professionals about its products.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 the company entered partnerships with several group purchasing organizations (GPOs) to facilitate increased direct sales of pulse oximetry products to hospitals.

        <p>
   Masimo increased revenues in 2012 by 12% to $493 million due to higher product sales, especially of consumable items (related to its rising number of installed equipment locations) and increased sales of new Rainbow SET products. It also experienced growth from acquisitions, increased marketing efforts, and through partnerships with OEMs and GPOs. Increased product sales were offset by lower royalties (caused by a decrease in the royalty rate of its partnership with Covidien).
  </p>
        <p>
   Net income decreased 2% to $62 million in 2012 due to higher costs for goods sold and increased operating expenses (related to increased staffing levels in the administrative and research divisions) and non-operating expenses (from currency exchange recognitions).
  </p>
        <p>
   Masimo has reported steadily rising revenues over the last five years from organic growth measures. However, net income has declined over the past three years due to the increased costs of a growing business.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Expansion is key to Masimo's strategy for growth. Its research and development efforts (with expenses of around $40 to $50 million per year) focus on novel products as well as improvements to existing products. Product enhancements have included a new monitoring capability that can detect methemoglobin (a form of hemoglobin that can cause a lack of oxygen in the blood), and the addition of total hemoglobin (oxygen in red blood cells) measurement. It is expanding the applications of its Rainbow SET products, which measure multiple blood components at once; it is also adding products that reduce the invasiveness of testing and that provide remote monitoring and alarm capabilities.
  </p>
        <p>
   To branch out beyond its traditionally targeted emergency and critical care setting markets, Masimo is promoting existing products (and adding new products) to meet the general treatment needs of hospitals and non-hospital environments. For example, the company is promoting its SET technology as ideal for use by home care agencies, post-acute care hospitals, and sleep diagnostic centers. It is also introducing new handheld products that allow for fast and simple measurement of perimeters in a variety of care settings. The company expects moves such as these to greatly expand its presence in non-critical care markets.
  </p>
        <p>
   Masimo also expands by entering new OEM licensing agreements (such as a long-term agreement for the use of its Rainbow SET products in GE Healthcare's patient monitors in 2012); by widening agreements with wholesale distributors; and by making occasional acquisitions.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   To bring manufacturing of some key components in-house, Masimo acquired Spire Semiconductor for $7 million in early 2012. Masimo had been one of Spire's largest customers, and having the LED manufacturer under its wing promises to speed development of new products.
  </p>
        <p>
   Also in 2012, Masimo acquired Phasein AB, which manufactures and sells ultra-compact capnography and gas analyzers, for some $30 million. The added products complement the company's existing portfolio of OEM solutions.
