   The economic downturn of the late 2000s benefited manufacturers of hair clippers in the consumer sector. Like rival

   , Andis saw an uptick in sales as those who typically rely on expensive stylists tookmatters into their own hands to trim, cut, curl, straighten, or dry their hair.

  <p>
   The grooming products company used its 90th anniversary in 2012 to launch of variety of new items, such as Special Edition UltraEdge Clipper, Tackmate horse groomer, and Red Master Clipper barber products.

   Along with others in the global grooming market, the company has chased  after the professional sector in India by collaborating with Partners in Distribution (PID) India, which specializes in providing the market with salon products. During 2011 Andis began selling curling irons, flat irons, hair dryers, and groomers through beauty and cosmetic stores and retailers of electronics.

  <p>
   Andis got its start in 1922 when Mathew Andis Sr. invented a self-contained electric clipper.
