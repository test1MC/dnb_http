   bluebird bio is ready to fly in the faces of rare genetic diseases. The company is using gene therapy to develop orphan drugs for two rare diseases. Its lead drug candidate, Lenti-D, is being developed to treat childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CCALD), a rare neurological disorder that affects boys. Its second drug candidate, LentiGlobin, is being developed to treat the blood disorders beta-thalassemia major and sickle cell disease. Both drugs will begin studies by 2014. In addition, bluebird bio partnered with
   <company id="12913">
    Celgene
   </company>
   to develop gene therapies for cancer. Founded in 1992 as Genetix Pharmaceuticals, the company changed its name to bluebird bio in 2010 and filed an IPO in 2013.

        <p>
   bluebird bio filed an initial public offering valued at $86 million in May 2013 and managed to raise $100 million when it priced a month later. It will use the proceeds to fund clinical studies for its drug candidates.

        <p>
   Gene therapy involves treating disease by introducing a different type of gene into a patient's cells to keep them from mutating and developing a disease or disorder. The FDA has yet to approve any human gene therapy for use in the US. If Lenti-D or LentiGlobin complete successful studies, they could be the nation's first gene therapy medications. However, the patient base for therapies to treat rare diseases are small -- only about 80 boys are born each year with CCALD in the US and Europe.

        <p>
   Drug development is expensive work, and bluebird teamed up with a larger company in 2013 to ease the burden.
   <company id="12913">
    Celgene
   </company>
   paid bluebird bio $75 million to develop disease-altering gene therapies in oncology. Under the agreement, bluebird bio will cover all drug develop initiatives, while Celgene will pay for manufacturing.

        <p>
   As a clinical-stage company, bluebird bio has yet to generate any revenue from product sales. The only revenue it records has been from research fees and grants.
