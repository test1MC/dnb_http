  <p>
   Nortek is now a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Melrose Industries. The acquisition by an experienced owner of manufacturing companies will help Nortek as it works to cut debt and increase profitability.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Nortek operates six main segments based on product category. Its Air Quality and Home Solutions (AQH), which makes range hoods and indoor air quality products, and Residential and Commercial HVAC (RCH) segments are the company's two largest, with each segment contributing 24% to its total revenue during 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Custom and Commercial Air Solutions (CAS), which makes custom HVAC products like air handlers and rooftop systems; and its Securities and Control Solutions (SCS) division, each contributed more than 15% of annual revenues in 2015. The Ergonomic and Productivity Solutions (EPS), which specializes in making wall mounts, workstations and various other monitor display mounts, brought in more than 10% of its total revenue. Its Audio, Video, and Control (AVC) segment, which made up 5% of revenues, sells audio and video equipment.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Rhode Island-based Nortek has more than 30 manufacturing facilities and primarily sells its products in the US, which accounts for about 85% of sales. It also makes and sells its products in Canada and Europe, with additional manufacturing in China and Mexico.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Nortek's HVAC and ventilation products are sold to the new construction, remodeling, and DIY markets, while its home technology products are sold to the personal and enterprise computer markets. The company's residential HVAC products are big sellers in Latin America and the Middle East.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, around 53% of the company's net sales were made through independent distributors, dealers, wholesalers and similar channels. Another 17% of net sales were made to commercial HVAC markets, while retailers and private label sales each made up 12% of net revenue. The remainder of sales were made to other commercial channels and manufactured housing original equipment manufacturers and aftermarket dealers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nortek spent $33.9 million on sales and marketing in 2015, compared to $34 million and $28.3 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Nortek's sales have steadily increased over the past several years thanks to strengthening housing and construction markets. Despite steady operating income, the manufacturer has suffered losses in recent years as interest expenses from growth-supporting, long-term debt has its outstripped its operating revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's sales dipped less than 1% to $2.53 billion during 2015 mostly because its AVC division sold its TV One subsidiary and suffered from lower business volume, and because its CAS segment lost business from a semiconductor client that was struggling that year. Nortek's one bright spot for the year, its ERG segment, grew 19% thanks to its Anthro acquisition.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nortek took a $26.7 million loss for 2015, though its losses improved considerably from the $45.6 million loss the year before, mostly as it suffered $79 million less in long-lived asset impairment and goodwill costs related to its underperforming audio and visual business. The company's operating cash levels jumped 31% to $49.1 million primarily because it used less cash toward working capital inventories and accounts receivables.

  <p>
   Nortek has been diversifying its income streams through acquisitions to insulate its business from the volatile residential and commercial construction markets. From 2013 through 2015, the company has acquired mobile personal emergency response and telehealth monitoring businesses, a technology furniture designer, a residential security system designer, and two HVAC companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep its products fresh, Nortek invests heavily in R&amp;D and has also been making improvements to its products to enhance style, performance, and energy efficiency. In 2015, for example, the company's
   <company id="124802">
    Nortek Global HVAC
   </company>
   subsidiary introduced a geothermal heat pump system that required less drilling than most other geothermal systems on the market, using a series of underground refrigerant tubes called an "Earth Loop."
  </p>
  <p>
   Nortek has also been reorganizing its business to cut operational costs and boost its bottom line since 2012. Some of its acquisitions, such as its Thomas &amp; Betts Corporation purchase in 2014, created cost synergies that boosted production and economies of scale. And over the past several years the company has moved some production operations to China, Poland, and Mexico, where labor costs are lower. As a result, manufacturing plans in California, Illinois, and Ohio were closed, as well as certain operations in Italy.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In June 2015, subsidiary Nortek Security &amp; Control expanded its technology lines more into the fast-growing healthcare market after acquiring Seattle-based Numera Inc's mobile personal emergency response system (mPERS) and telehealth businesses for $12 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2015, the company purchased Oregon-based Anthro Corporation, a designer and manufacturer of technology furniture such as charging carts and mobile workstations, including healthcare carts and adjustable sit/stand desks. Antrhos, which generated some $38 million (unaudited) in net sales in 2014, would join Anthros's Ergonomic and Productivity Solutions business segment following the deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   In October 2014, Nortek acquired the HVAC distribution business of privately owned Phoenix Wholesale. Operating out of five facilities in Arizona, including locations in Flagstaff, Tempe, and Tucson, the business will be integrated into Nortek's Residential Heating and Cooling (RHC) segment. The deal advanced the company's strategy of expanding its RHC segment's distribution footprint in regions where it lacked a significant market penetration.
  </p>
  <p>
   In April 2014, Nortek acquired the HVAC business of
   <company id="11475">
    Thomas &amp; Betts Corporation
   </company>
   (Reznor), which included the Reznor companies in the US and Europe, AmbiRad Ltd in the UK, and Gaz Industrie company in France, in a deal valued at $260 million. The purchase gave Nortek additional cross-selling opportunities, as well as cost synergies, particularly in the areas of supply chain, manufacturing and logistics.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013, to strengthen its technology products business, the company acquired 2GIGTechnolgoies (2GIG) a privately-held designer and supplier of residential security and home automation systems, for about $135 million.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   When demand for its HVAC products fell years ago with the declining housing market in the mid 2000s, the company turned its focus to technology products, building that business through several acquisitions. More recently, with strong demand for its innovative cooling technologies coming from data center operators, Nortek's CES Group subsidiary formed a Data Center Products Group to mine that growing market niche.
