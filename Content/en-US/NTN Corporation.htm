   NTN makes mechanical friction bear-able. The company manufactures metal and plastic bearings (from one millimeter to five meters in diameter) for use in almost any machine or mechanical system, including automobiles, jet engines, stereos, computers, and household appliances. NTN also makes precision processing and automated production equipment used in the high-tech industry, including CD inspection and LCD repair systems. NTN's automated production equipment includes bearings, spindles, and positioning tables. NTN also supplies the automobile industry with constant velocity joints (CVJ) that are used in four-wheel drive and independent suspension vehicles. Asia represents the company's largest market.

  <p>
   Headquartered in Osaka, Japan, NTN has sales, engineering, production and service networks throughout 27 countries, including Japan, the Americas, Europe, Asia, and China.

  <p>
   After enjoying steady growth for two years, NTN saw its revenues decline as it suffered a net loss in 2013. The fall in revenue for 2013 was primarily due to lower sales from both the Industrial Machinery and Aftermarket and Distributors markets. By geographic segment, NTN experienced decreases from Japan and Europe due to tougher economic climates and debt crisis concerns within those regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's large net loss of 2013 was the result of higher surcharge payments under an anti-monopolies law, structural reform expenses, the restructuring of global production systems, and reorganization related to expansion of its sales network throughout Asia.

  <p>
   NTN plans to boost sales in Europe, the Americas, China, and Asian region by building up its development and manufacturing systems and increasing its production capacity in order to strengthen its bearing business. It is targeting growth industries that include aircraft, rolling stock, wind turbines, agricultural machinery, and machine tools.
  </p>
  <p>
   In China, India, and Indonesia, NTN is working to expand its sales network, nurture core distributors, and strengthen selling systems using its information technology infrastructure. In addition, NTN is expanding its MRO (maintenance, repair, overhaul) business by targeting industries such as steel, paper, and port facilities. It plans to make the most of its NTN China Technical Center in Shanghai to build a system for local design and development, which should speed up the time it takes to respond to its customers.
