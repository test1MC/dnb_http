   Hexagon is a highly acquisitive company, buying firms that expand its portfolio of products and technology. In 2012 it acquired Norway-based My Virtual Reality Software AS (myVR), a provider of software used to enable 2D, 3D, and 360-degree viewing for desktop and mobile devices. The company's technology enables high-resolution, real-time viewing of interactive maps over networks with limited bandwidth.
  </p>
  <p>
   In one of its largest acquisitions up to that point, in 2010 the company bought geospatial software provider Intergraph in a deal valued at around $2.1 billion. Intergraph will become its core software platform, and while Intergraph will retain its name and branding as a wholly owned subsidiary, its software will also be integrated into existing measurement and precision technology systems products. Hexagon touts the acquisition as a way to significantly boost its market reach and enhance product growth opportunities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a related acquisition, Hexagon picked up Sisgraph, the Brazilian company that offers several services (including consulting, implementation, and training)for Intergraph products in Latin America, in 2011. The acquisition will give the company more access to business not only in Brazil, but also in South America as a whole.
