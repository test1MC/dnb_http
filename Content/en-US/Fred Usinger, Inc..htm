   A dedicated beer town like Milwaukee needs some sausage to "go with" and that's where Usinger's comes in. Fred Usinger, Inc., is a city institution known for its Old World sausage and other prepared meats. The company produces more than 70 kinds of sausage, including beerwurst, of course, as well as numerous varieties of bratwurst, knackwurst, summer sausage, and wieners. It also produces ham, bacon, and other smoked meats. Usinger's sells its products through retail food stores, as well as through its catalog and Web site. Usinger's also operates its landmark store in downtown Milwaukee. The family-owned company was founded in 1880 by German immigrant Fred Usinger.
