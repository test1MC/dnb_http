   Ikanos Communications hopes to become an icon in the field of broadband semiconductors. The fabless semiconductor company designs DSL chipsets for use in modems and other customer premises equipment and communications processors used in gateways (multi-protocol routers). Its products allow networks to achieve fiber-like broadband speeds (up to 100 megabits per second) over copper wires, enabling high-speed data features. Besides DSL, its products also support wireless broadband, passive optical network, and Ethernet. Service providers such as
   <company id="11379">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   and
   <company id="43307">
    Orange
   </company>
   are Ikanos' end users, but its direct customers are manufacturers such as
   <company id="41751">
    Alcatel-Lucent
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="140691">
    ZTE
   </company>
   . The company was acquired by
   <company id="11436">
    Qualcomm
   </company>
   in 2015.

        <p>
   As a fabless semiconductor company, Ikanos does not manufacture its own chips. It contracts with
   <company id="105955">
    eSilicon
   </company>
   to outsource all semiconductor fabrication, assembly, and test functions. (eSilicon is not a manufacturer either; it employs other wafer foundries in Asia.) By outsourcing manufacturing, Ikanos is able to keep costs down and focus on product design, development, sales, and marketing.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Ikanos has two offices in the US and international locations in China and India.

   The company targets two markets: broadband DSL and communications processors. Its products are sold to service providers through network equipment manufacturers (NEMs), original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design manufacturers (ODMs), and contract manufacturers (CMs).
  </p>
        <p>
   Most of its customers are located in Asia, where electronics are manufactured. In 2012 Sagemcom (located in Tunisia), Askey (Taiwan), and
   <company id="46895">
    Flextronics
   </company>
   (Hong Kong) together accounted for about 45% of sales.

   Overall sales fell 8% in 2012 to $125 million as Ikanos' aging products await new releases and it scrambles to keep up with technological advances in the broadband industry. However, in 2012 it did introduce a next generation CPE product chipsets under the brands Fusiv Vx185, Vx183, Vx175, and Vx173 to offset some revenue declines. Ikanos has been in the red for years, and 2012's net loss was -$17 million.
