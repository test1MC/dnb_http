   You don't need to be a mountain climber to view a Swiss valley. Just go to Iowa where Swiss Valley Farms operates a dairy cooperative focused on cheese and butter production. The cooperative sold its fluid milk and cultured products lines, including its bottling plant in Dubuque, to focus on higher-margin specialty cheeses, including blue-veined and chunk varieties. The coop represents nearly 800 member/farmers in the upper Midwest and has cheese making plants in Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. It also makes butter in Wisconsin. Swiss Valley Farms' customers include grocery store chains, independent grocers, warehouse clubs, convenience stores, schools, food service companies, and food manufacturers.

   Swiss Valley Farms has worked to expand its cooperative. To strengthen its position in the artisanal blue cheese category, the group acquired the assets of Minnesota-based Faribault Dairy in 2010. The deal brought onboard Faribault's cheese brands (including the popular Amablu brand), retail operations, and blue cheese production facility in Minnesota. The Faribault facility, which features sandstone caves for aging cheeses, complements Swiss Valley's other blue cheese plant in Wisconsin.

   Swiss Valley Farms also has concentrated on expanding its capacity in Swiss cheese-making. The company partnered with Emmi-Roth Kase in 2010 through a joint venture agreement. The collaboration, operating under the name White Hill Cheese Co., enables the pair to manufacture cheese in Shullsburg, Wisconsin, and tap the growing Swiss cheese business.
