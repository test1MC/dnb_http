   Dixons is truly a family affair. Dixons Surgical Instruments makes and supplies surgical instruments, portable autoclaves (to sterilize such instruments), and operating table accessories to hospitals and surgeons in the UK, Australia, Egypt, Hong Kong, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and Vietnam. It supplies a wide variety of instruments, especially for use in facial, orthopedic, thoracic, and proctological applications (though many other specialties are covered as well). Although it often brands products with its own name, Dixons can also supply unbranded instruments. It also makes reusable needles such as those used for biopsies and epidurals. The family-owned firm was founded in 1948 by Frank Dixon.

   Dixon is a major OEM supplier to most of the British surgical instrument industry. The company's product categories span the gamut from artery forceps and bronchoscopes to tongue depressors and vasectomy clamps. Dixon also provides products that are made by other UK manufacturers.

  <p>
   The company manufactures its surgical and orthopedic instruments combining the use of computer numerical controlled (CNC) machines and the manual skills of its craftsmen at its factory in Wickford. From time to time the company expands its product range by purchasing the manufacturing rights of established products.

  <p>
   In 2013, to expand its offerings for the orthopedic and other markets, Dixon acquired a new CNC coordinate measuring machine (CMC). The following year the company bought a fourth seat of CAM technology system SolidWorks and a second seat of SolidCAM from its CAD/CAM partner Cadtek.

  <p>
   The company was started in 1948 by Frank Dixon. The company's first break into the scientific market, however, came in 1990 when Dixon bought exclusive rights to manufacture the Express line of portable autoclaves that had been made by Arnold &amp; Sons, Basildon (owned by the McCarthy Group).
