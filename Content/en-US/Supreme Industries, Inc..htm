   Supreme Industries keeps businesses rolling on the road. The company builds and distributes specialized commercial truck bodies and buses, such as armored trucks, dry-freight and insulated cargo vans, service vans, shuttle buses, and trolleys. Its custom-made options include cargo-handling devices, lift gates, refrigeration equipment, and special doors and bumpers. Supreme Industries sells its lineup under the Kold King, Iner-City, Spartan, StarTrans, and other brand names. In addition to vehicle bodies, which represent most sales, the company makes Fuel Shark branded fiberglass wind deflectors. Supreme Industries' customers are truck distributors, commercial dealers, and end-users mainly in the US.

   The company has two operating segments: specialized vehicles (99% of sales) and fiberglass products (1%). Specialized vehicles is operated by Supreme Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary that makes customized truck bodies, buses, and other specialty vehicles such as customized armored vehicles and homeland response vehicles. The other segment sells fiberglass reinforced plywood to Supreme for use in the production of certain of its truck bodies and to third parties.

  <p>
   After experiencing two straight years of growth, Supreme Industries saw its revenues fall 5% from $300 million in 2011 to $286 million in 2012. The decline was driven by drops in sales for trucks (3%), buses (9%), and armored vehicles (13%). The decreases stemmed from lower sales from armored vehicles as a result of lower government procurements. Bus division sales also decreased in 2012 as the core market continued to feel the effects of tightened municipal and state budgets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the revenue dip, Supreme Industries saw its profits skyrocket from less than $1 million in 2011 to nearly $12 million in 2012. This huge increase was due to a decrease in interest expenses resulted from a combination of lower average bank borrowings and lower (performance-based) borrowing rates during 2012. The company was also helped by no legal settlement and related costs.

   Supreme Industries is focusing on new product offerings, technology, and sales force development to help refill its coffers. It has expanded and streamlined production of truck bodies for shuttle buses, commercial dry-freight vans, and armored suburban vehicles. Company R&amp;D is emphasizing green materials, too. Supreme Industries launched Aero-Body, a van body used with

   's ECO-MAX chassis, touted as functional, more fuel efficient, yet durable. In addition, sales also are buoyed by a five-year contract awarded by the

    US State Department
   </company>
   to produce up to $100 million armor-plated vehicles.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2013 Supreme Industries announced plans to divest its shuttle-bus business. As a proportion of revenue mix, bus products have represented a declining percentage of sales for the company, and divesting the operations will allow it to concentrate on more profitable markets with ongoing opportunities for growth.
