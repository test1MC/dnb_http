   In 1950 law student Pierre Péladeau borrowed $1,500 from his mother so he could buy a small Montreal newspaper called
   <i>
    Le Journal de Rosemont.
   </i>
   This became the base for Péladeau's publishing empire. Within a few years he had established five other weekly newspapers and his first printing firm.
  </p>
  <p>
   Péladeau seized the opportunity presented to him in 1964 by a strike at the major Montreal paper
   <i>
    La Presse.
   </i>
   He assembled a team from his various weeklies and, according to company legend, had the tabloid
   <i>
    Le Journal
   </i>
   on the streets within three days.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quebecor went public in 1972 and expanded beyond Quebec, branching out into a variety of communication concerns. But by the late 1980s, the company had refocused on its core printing businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company purchased printing plants in New Jersey and Michigan in 1985. Péladeau teamed with Robert Maxwell in 1987 to form Mircor to buy a stake in forestry concern Donohue. Quebecor took a major step into the international arena when it bought the printing group BCE PubliTech in 1988, making the company the #1 commercial printer in Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 Maxwell sold his US printing plants (with state-of-the-art printing presses) to Péladeau, who formed Quebecor Printing (USA) around the new assets. Maxwell subsequently bought a 26% stake in the new company for $100 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Maxwell died mysteriously in 1991 followed by revelations of deceptive finances and shady business dealings by the Maxwell empire. This allowed Péladeau to buy back all of Maxwell's shares in Quebecor at bargain-basement prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1990s Quebecor continued expanding, buying a bookbinding and publishing company in Mexico (Gráficas Monte Alban, 1991), three US printing plants (1993), France's largest commercial printer (Group Jean Didier, 1995), and a UK printer (1995). Quebecor Printing went public in 1995, which reduced the parent company's interest to less than 50%. Quebecor also set up its multimedia unit and expanded it by acquiring 50% of Sierra Creative Communications and 25% of multimedia software publisher Micro-Intel (1996).
  </p>
  <p>
   A Quebecor-controlled consortium in 1997 acquired Télévision Quatre Saisons, which operates three Canadian TV stations and the Quatre Saisons TV network license. (The company sold the network and related stations in 2001.) Péladeau died from heart failure that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Quebecor bought Sun Media, which made the company the #2 Canadian newspaper publisher. It later sold a 30% stake in Sun Media to a group of private investors for $260 million. In 1999 Quebecor Printing acquired World Color Press. Also that year Pierre Karl Péladeau, the founder's second son, took over as president and CEO. Péladeau family members filed a flood of lawsuits against one another and the executor of Pierre Péladeau's estate in a battle for control of family assets, including the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quebecor sold its controlling stake in market pulp, lumber, and newsprint producer Donohue to rival Abitibi-Consolidated in 2000. Also that year the company restructured into two operating units: Quebecor Printing (later Quebecor World) and Quebecor Media. Later in 2000 Quebecor and Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec (Quebec's public-pension agency) won a bidding war with Rogers Communications for the acquisition of Le Groupe Vidéotron, Canada's #3 cable TV operator, with an offer of $3.6 billion. Le Groupe Vidéotron's broadcasting company TVA Group was part of the deal, but was not finalized until 2001, after Quebecor completed the sale of its TQS network, which had been required by regulators.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company bought the 30% of Sun Media that it didn't already own. That year it also bulked up its Latin American holidings with the purchase of Grupo Serla, a school textbook printer in Mexico, and 75% of Grafica Melhoramentos, a Brazilian book publisher.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quebecor bought the European printing facilities of Hachette Filipacchi Médias (later known as
   <company id="92826">
    Lagardère Active
   </company>
   ) in 2001 and 2002. Also in 2002 the company merged its Publicor and TVA Publishing operations under the TVA Publishing name.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company cut loose its struggling Quebecor World subsidiary during 2008. Quebecor wrote off its stake in the printing unit after Quebecor World filed for bankruptcy early that year. Quebecor World changed its name to
   <company id="43925">
    World Color Press
   </company>
   (at the behest of Quebecor) and emerged from bankruptcy the following year. Quebecor subsequently began doing business exclusively through Quebecor Media, while World Color Press was acquired by and absorbed into rival
   <company id="41394">
    Quad/Graphics
   </company>
   in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2010 Quebecor Media expanded its business through the launch of a wireless 3G network. In 2011 it acquired Les Hebdos Montérégiens, owner of 15 newspapers, and launched a new cable TV channel, the Sun News Network.
