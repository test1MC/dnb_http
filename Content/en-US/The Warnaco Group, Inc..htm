   Underwear has long been The Warnaco Group's foundation. One of the top marketers of bras, the company designs and distributes intimates, swimwear, and sportswear under its own and licensed brands, including Calvin Klein, Speedo, Olga, and Warner's. Warnaco also makes menswear under the Chaps by Ralph Lauren brand. The manufacturer sells apparel to department stores, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, and specialty retailers in North America, as well as Asia, Europe, and South America. As part of its business, Warnaco also operates about 1,760 Calvin Klein retail stores worldwide and markets Calvin Klein and Speedo brand merchandise online. Warnaco was acquired by apparel maker

    PVH
   </company>
   in February 2013.

  <p>
   Formerly a publicly traded company, Warnaco emerged as a wholly owned subsidiary of PVH in 2013 as a result of its $2.9 billion acquisition by and subsequent merger with and into a PVH subsidiary. The cash-and-stock deal brought various Calvin Klein brands under one roof -- Warnaco held the Calvin Klein jeans and underwear licenses, while PVH controlled design and product development for the Calvin Klein brands. The acquisition arrived two years after PVH acquired the
   <company id="47960">
    Tommy Hilfiger
   </company>
   brand for $3 billion. PVH is now one of the largest global branded lifestyle apparel companies in the world, bringing together Warnaco's established operations in Asia and Latin America and PVH's strong presence in North America and Europe.

   Warnaco serves its parent company by owning the global Calvin Klein license for underwear, sleepwear, and loungewear.

   Leveraging distribution facilities and distribution contractors worldwide, Warnaco provides its products to wholesale customers and retail stores. It enlists the help of its distribution partners located in the US, Canada, and Mexico, as well as in China, Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan, the Netherlands, South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru. As part of its business, Warnaco also owns one distribution facility, leases about 10 others, and uses third-party services for more than 20 of its distribution warehouses.

   Parent company PVH plans to continue spreading its brands, including those held by Warnaco, across the globe. Specifically, it has been increasing its retail square footage in Brazil and China, increasing its presence in emerging markets in Asia and Latin America, and enhancing its fulfillment infrastructure worldwide.

  <p>
   The Warnaco Group was founded in 1874 by brothers DeVer and Lucien Warner. As doctors, they were concerned about the unhealthy effects of boned and tight-fitting women's corsets. After much research, DeVer came up with a new corset made only from cloth. Within a few weeks of selling their first goods from a one-room tailor shop in McGrawville, New York, the brothers had a flourishing business, which they called Warner Brother's or Warner's.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a business largely dependent on the changing trends of fashion, Warner's tried to adapt to the corsetless era of the 1920s with wraparound undergarments and by making greater use of rubber and elastic, but sales soured. After WWII, however, Warner's surged ahead.
  </p>
  <p>
   Warner's apparel division acquired shirtmaker Hathaway in 1960. The firm was renamed Warnaco in 1968. Despite expansion and diversification in the 1970s, it lost ground to cheaper imports. Warnaco succumbed to a $550 million hostile takeover in 1986 led by a group of investors, including Linda Wachner, who had worked for Warnaco in the mid-1970s.
  </p>
  <p>
   As chairman and CEO, Wachner transformed Warnaco from a maker of a mishmash of apparel products to a highly focused branded-apparel producer. Wachner and a group of investors bought Warnaco's Speedo swimwear division in 1990 (taking it public as Authentic Fitness in 1992, only to purchase it again in 1999). In 1991 the firm held its own IPO. It bought Calvin Klein's underwear business in 1994.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 Warnaco acquired GJM Group (private-label sleepwear and lingerie), Bodyslimmers (shapeware), and French lingerie maker Lejaby Euralis. It also sold its prestigious but underperforming Hathaway men's dress shirt operations. Sales topped $1 billion in 1996, but costs associated with the Hathaway sale and restructuring led to an $8 million loss.
  </p>
  <p>
   Warnaco bought Designer Holdings, a maker of Calvin Klein jeans and sportswear, in 1997. By 1999 Warnaco owned distribution rights for Calvin Klein jeans in Canada, giving the company control over Calvin Klein jeans production and distribution throughout the Americas.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Warnaco took a $69 million charge to discontinue Valentino and other brands and close a dozen outlet stores and a warehouse. The following year it bought 70% of UK perfume retailer Penhaligon and in 1999 added ABS by Allen Schwartz, a lower-priced designer womenswear maker.
  </p>
  <p>
   A lawsuit came between Wachner and her Calvins in 2000 when Calvin Klein sued both Warnaco and Wachner for trademark violation and breach of trust. Wachner returned fire, suing Klein and his company for trademark violations, defamation, and trade libel. The firms settled in the hours before their trial was set to begin in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   After dismal 2000 year-end results, Warnaco announced in April 2001 its plans to end its licensed Fruit of the Loom bra operations. In 2001 Warnaco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The board of directors ousted Wachner and replaced her with Antonio ("Tony") Alvarez as CEO and Stuart Buchalter as chairman. Alvarez began a restructuring program, which led to the sale of noncore assets such as GJM's sleepwear division and the closure of Calvin Klein outlet stores in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wachner sued Warnaco to get $25 million she said the company owed her. An agreement was reached in November 2002 in which Wachner received $3.5 million in stock in the reorganized company and $200,000 in cash. She remained on the board of directors until the company emerged from bankruptcy in early 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   The year 2002 also brought the first round of paring down retail outlets: the company closed 47 Speedo retail outlets, 64 domestic outlet stores, and almost half of its 26 Calvin Klein underwear stores. The next round came in late 2003, with closure of all remaining Speedo stores and sale of its White Stag line to
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In April 2003 Alvarez left and Joe Gromek (former CEO of Brooks Brothers) took over as president and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired the license, wholesale, and retail units for Calvin Klein jeans and accessories in Europe and Asia in January 2006 for about â‚¬240 million ($292 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Warnaco sold its OP women's and junior's swimwear brand (bought in 2004) to
   <company id="16933">
    Iconix Brand Group
   </company>
   for $54 million. (Previously, Warnaco had hoped to morph OP into a $1 billion brand.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Warnaco sold its Lejaby business to Palmers Textil for about $47 million in cash and $18 million in interest-free notes, effectively unloading the remainder of its own manufacturing operations. The firm also exited the designer swimwear category (except for the Calvin Klein brand) that year; it formerly marketed swimwear under license by Nautica, Michael Kors, and OP, as well as under its own private labels. (The move did not affect Warnaco's Speedo brand.) Warnaco sold its Anne Cole, Cole of California, and Catalina swimwear lines to swimwear company InMocean Group for $26 million in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 Warnaco purchased a business that operated about a dozen retail stores in China, just in time for the Beijing Olympic Games, where the company's Speedo brand got plenty of exposure. It paid about $2 million. The following year Warnaco shed less profitable divisions by discontinuing its Calvin Klein Golf and Calvin Klein Collection businesses, both of which operated in Korea and distributed the brand's merchandise to area retailers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Warnaco in mid-2011 acquired a 51% stake in its Indian distributor in a deal valued at more than $20 million. Buying into the Calvin Klein products distributor there allowed Warnaco to extend its retail reach in Northern Europe, Asia, and South America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Warnaco emerged as a wholly owned subsidiary of
   <company id="11183">
    PVH
   </company>
   in 2013 as a result of its $2.9 billion acquisition by and subsequent merger with and into a PVH subsidiary.
