   Historically, the key to Condé Nast's success had been to target a narrow audience segment that advertisers want to reach with hip and bold editorial flair. However, the weak economy has been challenging for Condé Nast, most of whose titles encourage readers to adopt a less-than-thrifty attitude.

  <p>
   In order to offset declines in ad-supported print revenue, the company is instead working to build up its digital content. It is also turning away from advertisers and towards consumers by charging readers for "premium content".
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also turns to digital platforms as an economical way to preserve print brands. Condé Nast introduced apps for
   <em>
    Wired
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    GQ
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    Vanity Fair
   </em>
   , and the
   <em>
    New Yorker
   </em>
   , which it offered through single issue sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company decided to stop publishing its
   <em>
    Details
   </em>
   magazine.
