   , SEAT (Sociedad Española de Automóviles de Turismo) sells as many as 390,500 passenger cars per year. The company's brand names include Alhambra, Altea, Cordoba, Exeo, Ibiza, Leon, and Toledo. SEAT exports about two-thirds of its production, mainly to Europe, although the company operates in more than 70 countries through thousands of dealers. It has manufacturing operations in Barcelona and sales companies in Germany, Portugal, and Spain. SEAT was founded in 1950 by Spain's Instituto Nacional de Industria (INI) in cooperation with Italy's

  <p>
   SEAT has three production centers located in Barcelona, El Prat de Llobregat, and Martorel, where it manufactures the Ibiza and Leon, among other models. Additionally, the company produces the Alhambra in Palmela (Portugal), the Mii in Bratislava (Slovakia) and the Toledo in Mladá Boleslav (Czech Republic). Spain accounted for 18% of its revenue in 2014.

  <p>
   The company's revenue increased by 16% in 2014. The growth was driven by significant increases within Europe, including Poland (193%), Portugal (80%), the Czech Republic (63%), Italy (28%), the United Kingdom (17%), Spain (15%), and Germany (10%).

  <p>
   SEAT is focused on its Ibiza (its best-selling car) and Leon brands. The key driver of growth in 2014 was its new Leon family, specifically the ST version, which achieved sales growth of 50%. It was also the first time the company sold more Leon models than Ibiza models.

  <p>
   Sociedad Española de Automóviles de Turismo (SEAT) was formed in 1950 by the Spanish government's Instituto Nacional de Industria (INI) in partnership with Italian carmaker Fiat. The INI's role in Francisco Franco's Spain was to revitalize Spanish industry by offering low-interest loans and encouraging Spanish companies to form alliances with foreign companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1953 a factory in Barcelona had been established that could turn out about 12 cars per day. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s production numbers steadily rose. SEAT's annual production was up to about 1 million cars by 1969. Models produced at the Barcelona factory included the 124, 600, 850, 1400, 1430, and 1500. The cars were assembled in Spain from parts imported from Fiat's factories in Italy.
  </p>
  <p>
   SEAT began to rack up huge losses in the 1970s due to the oil crisis and economic difficulties associated with Spain's transition from fascism to democracy. Having absorbed the brunt of the company's losses since its inception, Fiat had had enough and sold its interest in SEAT back to the INI in 1981.
  </p>
  <p>
   With Fiat out of the picture, SEAT began to introduce its own models such as the Fura, Ronda, and Ibiza (1983). The future of SEAT, however, was uncertain until 1986 when Volkswagen AG acquired a 51% stake in the company. Volkswagen increased its stake in SEAT to 99.99% in 1990.
