   The pressure is on to enhance oil and gas well production. Natural Gas Services Group (NGS) manufactures and leases natural gas compressors used to boost oil and gas well production, primarily in non-conventional plays such as coal bed methane, tight gas, and oil and gas shales. The company also provides flare tip burners, ignition systems, and components used to combust waste gases before entering the atmosphere. NGS leases compressors to third parties in Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming. In 2012 some 1,756 units of the company's rental fleet of 2,279 compressors were rented out to clients.

  <p>
   NGS makes and sells compressors and related equipment. In additions, its rental business allows it to generate revenues from oil and gas companies that do not wish to put out the capital outlay required in compressor purchases.

  <p>
   NGS' revenues grew by 44% in 2012 driven by higher equipment sales and rental income and higher natural gas prices, partially offset by lower service and maintenance revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Equipment sales were up primarily due to the greater demand for compressor units as a result of customers' continued investment in non-conventional shale plays (which require compression to produce natural gas).
  </p>
  <p>
   Rental revenues increased as a result of increased rental pricing and higher fleet utilization (77% in 2012).
  </p>
  <p>
   NGS' net income grew by 30% in 2012 as stronger revenues outpaced an increase in operating expenses.

  <p>
   NGS has grown through a number of acquisitions. Its organic business model has fueled its growth, too. The top provider of small to medium-sized horsepower compression equipment to the natural gas industry, the company focuses on serving the non-conventional natural gas production market, the largest and fastest-growing gas production segment in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's growth strategy is also tied to building up its compressor rental business. It intends to increase the size of its rental fleet by fabricating compressor units to keep pace with the growth of the market. In addition to its primary rental and engineered product businesses, NGS is also expanding its secondary product lines, such as flares and Cylinder-in-Plane compressor products, general compressor maintenance, and repair services.
