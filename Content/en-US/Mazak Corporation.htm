  <p>
   The company is ramping up production to meet increased global industrial activity.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Mazak's Concept Technical Sales unit moved into a new larger facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the company launched the new INTEGREX i-400AM (additive manufacturing) HYBRID Multi-Tasking Machine, which will offers manufacturers a new innovative alternative to conventional processing in terms of part design and machining.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, Mazak launched a strategic reorganization to change how the company's machine tools and manufacturing solutions are sold and supported in the Southeast region area and to grow the market share for the brand in South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia and Florida. As part of the reorganization three of the company's distributors Premier Engineering LLC, Machine Tech and Premier Machinery will expand into South Carolina.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 it grew its production capacity to 200 machines a month, up from 130 machines a month in 2011, and 50 machines a month in 2009.
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the past several years, the parent company has poured more than $13 million into its US operations to upgrade equipment and facilities. Distribution efficiency and material handling capacity remains the life blood of Mazak operations. The company has automated its hub plant in Florence, Kentucky, in an effort to spur response time for an assortment of parts and after-sale-services, as well as trim its own production costs. As a first in the machine tool OEM industry, Mazak is converting its Florence plant over to the MTConnect open communications protocol. The transformation will allow Mazak to monitor its manufacturing equipment and gather valuable data that will be used to further improve manufacturing operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Yamazaki Mazak installed a new PALLETECH system equipped with an intelligent robot in the Oguchi plant, to achieve automated operation of large component machining, resulting in major reductions in lead times and labor costs. Mazak has rearranged its production floor with new equipment and systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Mazak launched a new North American website (www.MazakUSA.com); it also introduced VARIAXIS j-500 5X vertical machining center with full simultaneous 5-axis machining capability.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company completed the expansion of its National Technology Center and Customer Service Headquarters, expanding the size of the National Technology Center (East Building) from 69,000 sq. ft. to 100,183 sq. ft.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2012, Mazak further invested $1 million to its North American Parts Center to expand the facility's storage capacity by 25%. The move allows the company to stock more than 50,000 unique part numbers valued at more than $65 million, with 97% of stock available for immediate same-day delivery.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mazak's production turnaround came as its parent company regained its momentum in the wake of Japan's earthquake and tsunami (spring 2011). The parent in 2011 invested another $9 million in production equipment and is moving to open a technology center in Houston to capitalize on Gulf Coast opportunities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mazak was founded in 1968. To expand production it moved from New York to Kentucky in 1974.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's parent (Yamazaki Mazak) was formed in 1919.
