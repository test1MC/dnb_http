   Wilbur and Orville Wright's first flight might never have succeeded without an assist from Amsted Industries' Diamond Chain subsidiary. A maker of bicycle and industrial roller chains, Diamond produced the propeller chain for the Wright brothers' aircraft. Amsted Industries' three different segments manufacture highly engineered industrial components for locomotive and railcar makers, automotive OEMs, and construction and building suppliers. It is a major force in making freight car undercarriages, too. Main subsidiaries (besides Diamond Chain) include Amsted Rail, Burgess Norton, ConMet, Baltimore Aircoil Company, Griffin Pipe Products, Griffin Wheel, and Means Industries.

   The company's three major product lines include railroad products, vehicular products, and construction and industrial products. Amsted Industries' operations benefit from a history of making cast-steel components, including wheels and tapper roller bearings for railroad companies, and a variety of vehicular parts, such as steering and transmission components. Amsted Industries' construction and industrial lines feature pressure and sewer pipe, and cooling towers and evaporative condensers.

  <p>
   The company's expertise has evolved through acquisitions of complementary businesses, and partnerships with companies in promising markets. Amsted Industries holds, for example, a 50/50 stake in Amsted Maxion, a joint venture with
   <company id="162549">
    Iochpe-Maxion
   </company>
   . The Brazilian partner manufactures metal transport and railroad parts; its tie-up has opened the door for Amsted Industries to supply Latin American demand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Amsted Industries' primary strategy is to employ its product development capabilities, advanced manufacturing processes and marketing skills in market niches where it can achieve a market leadership position.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company is employee-owned.
  </p>
  <p>
   Founded as American Steel Foundries in 1902, the company united the strength of eight steel foundries across the East and Midwest. In 1962 the company decided to emphasize its manufacturing diversity, and changed its name to Amsted Industries.
