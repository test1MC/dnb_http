   Success in solar is more than an aspiration for Spire. Factories worldwide use Spire's photovoltaic solar cell manufacturing equipment, including cell testers and assemblers, to produce modules that convert sunlight into electricity. Its solar systems unit also uses the equipment to make solar energy modules for buildings and homes. Though Spire's roots are in solar energy, the company also has a biomedical unit that provides coating services to orthopedic and other medical device makers. Its products are manufactured at its US headquarters, and Spire gets almost half of its sales domestic customers. Key customers include
   <company id="151560">
    First Solar
   </company>
   and
   <company id="14815">
    Stryker Orthopedics
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   The company's flagship product, Sun Simulator, tests the performance of photovoltaic modules. It has been installed in some 200 factories in 50 countries. Together First Solar and Stryker (a customer of its biomedical surface treatments) account for about a quarter of sales.

   Things were tough for Spire in 2012. That year overall revenues sunk 62% to $22 million as fewer customers bought its products. The company cites the oversupply of photovoltaic modules that has resulted in reduced demand for its photovoltaic manufacturing equipment. The biomedical division also saw sales slump that year. Spire has traditionally struggled with profitability, though 2012's net loss was less than $2 million.

   The market for solar manufacturing equipment can be volatile and Spire generally sells to a limited number of customers in a given year. Competition in the market is increasing, as well, with semiconductor manufacturing equipment makers such as
   <company id="12647">
    Applied Materials
   </company>
   entering the market. Semiconductors and solar cells use similar manufacturing processes and equipment. Spire is looking to provide more materials and components, as opposed to turnkey equipment, as the solar equipment market continues to mature. The company has also implemented significant cost reduction efforts, including divesting non-core divisions and reducing headcount by more than 50 people in 2012.

   Looking to focus on its solar and biomedical businesses, in 2012 Spire sold its optoelectronics division, Spire Semiconductor, to
   <company id="102267">
    Masimo Corporation
   </company>
   for $8 million. Spire Semiconductor (renamed Masimo Semiconductor) specializes in wafer epitaxy, foundry, and device fabrication services. Masimo was one of Spire Semiconductor's largest customers.
