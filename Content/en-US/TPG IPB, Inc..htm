   TPG IPB (which does business as CognitiveTPG) doesn't have a license to print money, but it can help you print a receipt. The company makes thermal and impact printers and supplies for the banking, gaming, hospitality, and retail markets. It designs, manufactures, and services printers and impact printheads produced at its two US-based facilities and through contract manufacturers located in Ciudad Ju√°rez, Mexico, and Shenzhen, China. The company is a subsidiary of ATSI Holdings. ATSI combined Transaction Printer Group and its Cognitive Solutions subsidiary (a supplier of thermal printers, software, and supplies used to create bar code labels) to create TPG IPB.

   Donald Hebert and Helmut Falk started DH Technology (named for their initials) in 1977 to explore opportunities in commercial printing. The result was dot matrix technology, which arranged small ink dots to form printed characters.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1980s DH supplied printheads to computer maker Wang Laboratories (later part of Getronics) and to Bell &amp; Howell for its Documail systems. Under Falk's leadership DH went public in 1984.
  </p>
  <p>
   William Gibbs, former president of Computer and Communications Technology, became CEO in 1985. (Falk retired as chairman in 1987.) Gibbs built a customer base through diversification. The company bought Micro Peripherals (dot matrix printers) in 1985, Eaton Printer Products (printing mechanisms) in 1988, and Identification Business (laser printers) in 1990. It moved manufacturing operations to Mexico in 1988 to slash costs and undercut rivals.
  </p>
  <p>
   DH acquired bar code printer makers Cognitive Solutions and Stadia Colorado in 1994. The following year the company bought Mos Magnetics, a maker of magnetic heads used in credit card and ticket readers. Also in 1995 DH won a multiyear contract from
   <company id="40126">
    DHL Worldwide
   </company>
   , and in 1997 the company acquired American Magnetics' card reader unit. That year privately held Axiohm SA bought DH in a reverse acquisition. The new company was named Axiohm Transaction Solution (ATSI).
  </p>
  <p>
   Formerly Schlumberger's thermal printhead business, Axiohm SA was formed by Patrick Dupuy and Gilles Gibier in 1988 in a management-led buyout. Axiohm opened a US subsidiary in 1989 and a French factory in 1991. The following year it added a subsidiary in Hong Kong and an office in Taiwan. It expanded into Germany in 1993 and acquired the point-of-sale printer division of AT&amp;T's Global Information Systems (now
   <company id="43707">
    NCR
   </company>
   ) in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following the acquisition, Axiohm posted a loss for 1997. Gibbs resigned and was replaced as CEO in 1998 by former Axiohm director and acquisition specialist Nicolas Dourassoff. That year the company acquired France-based AP Print SA, a maker of printers for plastic cards such as driver's licenses and access control cards.
  </p>
  <p>
   Axiohm streamlined operations in 1998, combining and moving facilities and restructuring around divisions. Still in the red for 1998, Axiohm in 1999 hired a financial adviser to develop a strategy to regain its footing. Later that year the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
  </p>
  <p>
   After seven months, Axiohm emerged from bankruptcy in 2000. The reorganization included moving the company's headquarters to its Ithaca, New York, manufacturing facility and naming the senior managing director of its restructuring, Marc Pfefferle, as CEO. Dourassoff remained president.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 former
   <company id="11657">
    Xerox
   </company>
   executive Barbara Waal was chosen to take the reins as CEO of Axiohm. The company sold its operations in France and the UK in 2003. It retained its Ithaca printer business and changed the name to Transaction Printer Group (TPG). ATSI agreed to sell TPG to
   <company id="51603">
    TransAct Technologies
   </company>
   in 2004, but the deal was later terminated.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 Cognitive and TPG merged and became known as CognitiveTPG (still part of ATSI Holdings).
