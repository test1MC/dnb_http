National Gypsum has about 40 plants in the US and Canada and sells its products worldwide to the construction industry. The company is a subsidiary of Delcor, itself a subsidiary of privately held Golden Eagle Industries.

  <p>
   Key to National Gypsum's strategy is vertical integration. In an effort to control the quality and cost of its products, it owns three paper mills that make liner paper for drywall, as well as eight gypsum mines and quarries.
