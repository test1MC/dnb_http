   One might wonder whether or not Hearst Television ever shows
   <i>
    Citizen Kane
   </i>
   on its stations. The company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
   <company id="40209">
    Hearst Corporation
   </company>
   (Hearst family patriarch William Randolph Hearst was the inspiration for the 1941 film). It is one of the leading TV groups in the US with about 30 stations (both owned and managed) serving more than two dozen markets around the country. The stations reach nearly 20% of US households and are primarily affiliated with the
   <company id="10290">
    ABC
   </company>
   and
   <company id="47376">
    NBC
   </company>
   networks. The firm also manages two Hearst radio stations in Baltimore. Hearst Corporation took the TV business (formerly called Hearst-Argyle Television) private in 2009.

   The company's stations are concentrated in eastern region of the US.

   While traditional TV is suffering, Hearst Television has also been looking to the Internet for additional revenue streams. Its 40%-owned
   <company id="110274">
    Internet Broadcasting Systems
   </company>
   operates a number of websites for local TV stations. The firm also sells ad space on those sites. Hearst Television's focus on mobile content and other digital platforms resulted in more than 4 billion page views in 2012.

   In 2013 the company renewed its alliance with PolitiFact, the fact-checking website of the
   <em>
    Tampa Bay Times
   </em>
   .

  <p>
   In 2011 Hearst Corporation acquired 50% of
   <company id="148346">
    Mark Burnett Productions
   </company>
   , the leading producer of such popular reality television shows as Survivor and Celebrity Apprentice. The joint venture will accelerate Hearst Television's ability to broadcast a wide array of nonfiction entertainment that it can distribute across multiple platforms.
