   The corn products company is chasing after the growing US Hispanic population, which is expected to increase approximately 3.5% per year. It's banking on tortilla product consumption not only by Hispanics but by non-Hispanic communities living in the US. Besides its direct-to-consumer business, Gruma Corporation grows its market share by selling its corn flower to other manufacturers of tortillas and tortilla chips.
