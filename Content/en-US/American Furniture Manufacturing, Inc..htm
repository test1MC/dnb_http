   American Furniture Manufacturing (AFM) does most of its business at home. The company makes low-cost upholstered home furnishings, including sofas, chairs, and recliners, as well as accent tables. Its products are distributed to independent furniture stores in the US. AFM can ship most furniture within 48 hours, and delivery is handled by its American Furniture Trucking division, which maintains a fleet of trucks. The furniture maker sources wood and fabrics from the Asia/Pacific region, which has also helped to keep costs down. Former parent
