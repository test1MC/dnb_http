   The drumbeat urging this company forward is the drone of printing presses. Advance Publications is a leading newspaper and magazine publisher with several dozen titles. Its portfolio of about 25 newspapers includes
   <em>
    The Star-Ledger
   </em>
   (New Jersey),
   <em>
    The Cleveland Plain Dealer
   </em>
   , and namesake
   <em>
    Staten Island Advance
   </em>
   , as well as more than 40 weekly titles published by
   <company id="103981">
    American City Business Journals
   </company>
   . Through
   <company id="57226">
    Advance Magazine Publishers
   </company>
   (DBA Condé Nast), the company owns magazines including
   <em>
    The New Yorker, Vanity Fair
   </em>
   , and
   <em>
    Wired
   </em>
   . Other operations and interests include online content and cable television. Patriarch Sam Newhouse started the family-owned business with the purchase of the
   <em>
    Staten Island Advance
   </em>
   in 1922.

        <p>
   Advance Publications' focus on editorial content means most of its revenue comes from advertising and subscriptions. However, the publishing business has been in decline for several years as readers turn to the Internet and other sources for their news and information. The downturn in the economy has only added to those problems. In response, the company has looked for ways to reduce operating costs at its papers and magazines, including staff cuts and mandatory furloughs.

        <p>
   Through acquisitions, creative development, and aggressive promotion, Advance Publications has built a formidable estate of media properties. In 2014 the company agreed to sell
   <company id="100749">
    Fairchild Fashion Media
   </company>
   to Penske Media.

   Solomon Neuhaus (later Samuel I. Newhouse) got started in the newspaper business after dropping out of school at age 13. He went to work at the
   <i>
    Bayonne Times
   </i>
   in New Jersey and was put in charge of the failing newspaper in 1911; he managed to turn the paper around within a year. In 1922 he bought the
   <i>
    Staten Island Advance
   </i>
   (founded 1886) and formed the Staten Island Advance Company in 1924. After buying up more papers, he changed the name of the company to Advance Publications in 1949. By the 1950s the company had local papers in New York, New Jersey (including
   <em>
    The Star-Ledger
   </em>
   ), and Alabama.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1959 Newhouse bought magazine publisher Condé Nast as an anniversary gift for his wife. (He joked that she had asked for a fashion magazine, so he bought her
   <i>
    Vogue.
   </i>
   ) His publishing empire continued to grow with the addition of the
   <i>
    Times-Picayune
   </i>
   (New Orleans) in 1962 and
   <i>
    The Cleveland Plain Dealer
   </i>
   in 1967. In 1976 the company paid more than $300 million for Booth Newspapers, publisher of eight Michigan papers and
   <i>
    Parade Magazine.
   </i></p>
        <p>
   Newhouse died in 1979, leaving his sons Si and Donald to run the company, which encompassed more than 30 newspapers, a half-dozen magazines, and 15 cable systems. The next year Advance bought book publishing giant
   <company id="43807">
    Random House
   </company>
   from RCA. Si resurrected the Roaring Twenties standard
   <i>
    Vanity Fair
   </i>
   in 1983 and added
   <i>
    The New Yorker
   </i>
   under the Condé Nast banner in 1985. The Newhouses scored a victory over the
   <company id="150643">
    IRS
   </company>
   in 1990 after a long-running court battle involving inheritance taxes. Condé Nast bought Knapp Publications (
   <i>
    Architectural Digest
   </i>
   ) in 1993 and Advance later acquired
   <company id="103981">
    American City Business Journals
   </company>
   in 1995.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1998 the company sold the increasingly unprofitable Random House to
   <company id="40661">
    Bertelsmann
   </company>
   for about $1.2 billion. It later bought hallmark Internet magazine
   <i>
    Wired
   </i>
   (though it passed on Wired Ventures' Internet operations). That year revered
   <i>
    New Yorker
   </i>
   editor Tina Brown, credited with jazzing up the publication's content and increasing its circulation, left the magazine; staff writer and Pulitzer Prize winner David Remnick was named as Brown's replacement.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1999 Advance joined Donrey Media Group (now called
   <company id="47285">
    Stephens Media Group
   </company>
   ),
   <company id="13254">
    E.W. Scripps
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="40209">
    Hearst Corporation
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41223">
    MediaNews Group
   </company>
   to purchase the online classified advertising network AdOne (later named PowerOne Media). It also bought
   <company id="11603">
    Walt Disney
   </company>
   's trade publishing unit, Fairchild Publications (now
   <company id="100749">
    Fairchild Fashion Group
   </company>
   ), for $650 million. In 2000 the company announced it would begin creating Web versions of its popular magazine titles.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2001 Condé Nast bought a majority stake in Miami-based Ideas Publishing Group (Spanish language versions of US magazines; its name was later changed to
   <company id="61638">
    Condé Nast Americas
   </company>
   ). Also that year Advance bought four golf magazines, including
   <i>
    Golf Digest,
   </i>
   from the
   <company id="12184">
    New York Times Company
   </company>
   for $430 million. Condé Nast picked up
   <i>
    Modern Bride
   </i>
   magazine from
   <company id="40258">
    PRIMEDIA
   </company>
   in 2002 for $52 million.

   Richard Diamond, a Newhouse relative who'd been publisher of the
   <em>
    Staten Island Advance
   </em>
   since 1979, died in 2004. The following year, Condé Nast launched home magazine
   <em>
    Domino
   </em>
   and lifestyle title
   <em>
    Cookie
   </em>
   targeting the mommy set. The magazine publisher branched out into business news in 2007 with
   <em>
    Condé Nast Portfolio
   </em>
   (closed in 2009).
  </p>
        <p>
   Affiliate Advance/Newhouse combined its stake in cable programmer
   <company id="43731">
    Discovery Communications
   </company>
   with the interests of John Malone (head of
   <company id="51395">
    Liberty Media
   </company>
   ) in 2008 to spin off Discovery as a public company. A downturn in the economy that year led to a sharp decline in ad revenue for many of Advance Publications' newspaper and magazine titles.
   <em>
    The Star-Ledger
   </em>
   was forced to cut about 40% of its workforce to reduce costs. Condé Nast, meanwhile, shuttered several titles in 2009, including
   <em>
    Cookie, Domino, Gourmet
   </em>
   , and
   <em>
    Modern Bride
   </em>
   .
