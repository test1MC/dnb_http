   When osteoarthritis brings patients to their knees, MAKO Surgical has a medical device that might help. The company developed and markets the MAKOplasty partial knee resurfacing system, a minimally invasive alternative to traditional knee replacement surgery for patients with early- to mid-stage osteoarthritis. Proprietary components of the system consist of patient-specific visualization technology and a robotic arm (RIO) that helps orthopedic surgeons prepare the knee joint for insertion of MAKO's resurfacing implants (RESTORIS) through a small incision. It also has developed a total hip arthroplasty application. MAKO was acquired by medical device maker
   <company id="14815">
    Stryker
   </company>
   for some $1.65 billion in 2013.

  <p>
   Stryker reached a deal to purchase MAKO in September 2013 to expand its robot-assisted surgery offerings; the transaction was completed in December 2013. MAKO will benefit from Stryker's strong presence in the orthopedic device industry.
