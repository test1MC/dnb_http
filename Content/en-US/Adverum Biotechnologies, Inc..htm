   Adverum (formerly Avalanche) Biotechnologies wants to clear up anything that might be clouding your vision. The development-stage pharmaceutical company targets eye diseases that could result in blindness using gene therapy and a patient's own cells to secrete and deliver a therapeutic protein over time. Its lead product treats wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and other conditions. The drug next in line would actually prevent wet AMD. Adverum holds exclusive worldwide rights to these products. A third targets retinoschisis, a genetic retinal disease that causes vision loss in boys and young men; it is developing that drug with fellow pharma firm

    Regeneron
   </company>
   . The company was formed in 2006 and went public in 2014.

  <p>
   Then named Avalanche, the company raised $102 million in its IPO. It is using those proceeds to fund its products in

    FDA

   testing and for R&amp;D for additional drugs.

  <p>
   Because Adverum doesn't yet have a product to market, it hasn't received any substantial revenue - less than half a million total in government grants since its formation in 2006 (as of year-end 2013). Like any development-stage company, however, it continues to spend on R&amp;D and putting its candidates through clinical trials. The company's total accumulated deficit stood at $10.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2014. At that time, it did receive an $8 million research collaboration payment from Regeneron for work on its juvenile X-linked retinoschisis.

  <p>
   Of course, Adverum's strategy requires bringing its wet AMD treatment and other drugs to market. Should AVA-101 be approved, it holds considerable advantage over existing treatments since they require multiple injections in the eye, which leads to patient compliance issues. AVA-101, on the other hand, is a one-time injection that makes retina cells continue to produce naturally occurring protein. Adverum also intends to seek additional uses for AVA-101 and find other uses for its proprietary therapeutic protein mechanism (Ocular BioFactory). If it finds uses for Ocular BioFactory outside its area of eye diseases, the company has said it will seek collaborations or partnerships.

   In mid-2016, Avalanche Biotechnologies acquired Annapurna Therapeutics; after the deal closed, it renamed itself Adverum Biotechnologies. The Annapurna acquisition added drug development expertise and gene therapy programs.
