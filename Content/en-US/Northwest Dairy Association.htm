   Northwest Dairy Association (NDA) members milk a lot of cows. The dairy cooperative's 550-plus member/farmers ship 7.2 billion pounds of milk annually, which is processed by the co-op's subsidiary
   <company id="40115">
    Darigold
   </company>
   and packaged and sold under the Darigold label. NDA produces fluid and cultured dairy products, including milk, butter, cottage cheese, sour cream, and yogurt that altogether generate some $2 billion in sales. It also makes bulk butter and cheese, milk powder, and whey products. The co-op caters to several sectors nationwide. Its customers include food retailers and wholesalers, as well as foodservice and food-manufacturing companies. The association's membership spans half a dozen US states.

   NDA added Country Classic Dairies to its operations in 2010. Its Montana-based business churn out Darigold-branded products with help from its 30 member/farmers. Securing the Country Classics business added some 160 million pounds of milk a year (more than half of Montana's milk supply) to the co-op's total production. NDA and Country Classic's union was the culmination of the two businesses' longtime working relationship (at one time, Country Classic used the Darigold name to market its products).
