   Parmalat makes an assortment of milk products. Its Parmalat's UHT (Ultra High Temperature or shelf-stable) milk products stay fresh without refrigeration -- convenient in markets where home refrigerators are small or non-existent. It also produces other products such as cheese, ice cream, and juice. Its global brands primarily include Parmalat for milk and dairy products and Santàl for fruit beverages. Parmalat, Italy's largest listed food company, came under French control in 2011 when dairy giant
   <company id="54346">
    Groupe Lactalis
   </company>
   acquired 83% of its shares.
  </p>

  <p>
   Parmalat has facilities in Europe, the Americas, Africa, and Australia in 31 countries and has 72 factories. North America is the company's largest market, representing 44% of sales. Other major markets include Europe (21%), Latin America (11%), Australia (17%), and Africa (7%).

  <p>
   armalat Finanziaria evolved out of the Tanzi family business called Tanzi Calisto e Figli - Salumi e Conserve (Tanzi Calisto &amp; Sons - Cold Cuts and Preserves). After Calisto Tanzi inherited the company at age 22, he directed the company into the production of dairy products in 1961 and created the Parmalat brand in 1963.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company opened its first pasteurizing plant in Collechio, Parma, becoming the first Italian manufacturer of branded milk. In 1963 Parmalat's milk sold in the first dairy shops opened in the province of Parma and neighboring regions. Parmalat created new milk products and used innovative packaging to enhance the fresh milk trade.
  </p>
  <p>
   Parmalat pioneered practicality in the pantry with milk made to last on the shelf. In 1966, using packaging technology from Tetra Pak (now part of
   <company id="92818">
    Tetra Laval
   </company>
   ), Parmalat created its signature product, milk pasteurized at Ultra High Temperatures (UHT), giving milk an unrefrigerated shelf life that exceeds six months. UHT milk provided Parmalat with a technological competitiveness in the milk industry, placing Parmalat ahead of its competition.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1970s brought about changes in milk legislation, which allowed the spread of Parmalat's products into other Italian provinces. In 1970 the law permitted the sale of whole milk in grocery stores, removing the limitation of specialty milk shops. The courts broke up the Centrali del Latte (Municipal Milk distributing centers) monopoly in Italy in 1973, removing another limitation on the Parmalat product.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Parmalat brand gained world recognition as the innovator of sporting event sponsorship in 1975. Parmalat became known as the "champion's milk" after sponsoring the Ski World Cup in 1975 and world champion Formula One race car driver Nicki Lauda in 1976 and 1977.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company moved into new markets with the production of cheese, butter, and a variety of desserts near the end of the 1970s. Parmalat also began international expansion through acquisitions in Germany (1977) and France (1979).
  </p>
  <p>
   Holding company Finanziaria Centro Nord acquired Parmalat in 1989 and changed its name to Parmalat Finanziaria in 1990. Parmalat increased the presence of its dairy and food products in more than 30 countries by 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Parmalat bought a 22% stake in NetGrocer.com (renamed
   <company id="57773">
    neXpansion, Inc.
   </company>
   in 2002) and plunked down more than US$6 million (about €4 million) for a stake in the e-marketing consortium 1SYNC, Inc. (formerly Transora.com) to serve the company's online expansion activities. Parmalat also acquired the brand names Archway Cookies and Mother's Cake &amp; Cookie Company from Specialty Foods to further expand in North America. Also in 2000 the company took over Streglio, a prestigious Italian chocolate maker, and acquired the controlling stake in UK yogurt maker Dairytime.
  </p>
  <p>
   Keeping the company firmly in family hands, Calisto Tanzi's son Stefano was named CEO in 2001. That October Parmalat agreed to acquire the Brazilian assets of Kraft Foods' dairy business, including the Gloria and Avare brands and some manufacturing operations. Late in 2001 the company folded all of its North American businesses (Parmalat USA, Bakery Group, and Canada) into a new unit,
   <company id="105270">
    Parmalat Group North America
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Parmalat acquired
   <company id="41850">
    Unilever
   </company>
   's South African cheese units, including the Simonsberg and Melrose brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   A questionable offshore investment took a wrong turn in late 2003, leaving the company scrambling to make a routine bond payment despite seeming to have plenty of cash on hand. After two CFOs quit in rapid succession, the company hired Enrico Bondi to help turn the company around. As the company narrowly missed defaulting on a bond of €150 million (US$215 million), Parmalat's founder, chairman, and CEO Calisto Tanzi resigned, handing over his company's reins to Bondi, who was named chairman and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's finances were placed in further question when
   <company id="58444">
    Bank of America
   </company>
   denied holding nearly €4 billion in cash and cash equivalents that Parmalat had listed as assets. Investigations revealed that the company's Bonlat subsidiary in the Cayman Islands had been a shell where losses from other divisions were transferred while other Tanzi holdings, including tourism companies and the Parma soccer team, had been receiving large amounts of cash from Parmalat. Closer inspection of Parmalat's accounts found approximately US$18 billion (€13 billion) of gross debt, which had been hidden through years of false billing and false transactions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shortly after the scandal broke, the
   <company id="56705">
    US Securities and Exchange Commission
   </company>
   filed suit against Parmalat for selling US$1 billion (€700 million) of fraudulent bonds to US investors. The company reached a settlement in July 2004 and, while neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing, avoided a fine by agreeing to stringent reforms as it emerges from bankruptcy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Italy's
   <company id="91666">
    IntesaBci
   </company>
   was the first bank to settle a bond dispute with Parmalat. In 2004 Intesa agreed to pay US$197 million (€138 million) for the role its Nextra fund management unit played in a US$368 million (€257 million) bond sale in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Bondi hired securities investigation firm
   <company id="52243">
    Kroll
   </company>
   to track down Parmalat's missing assets, believed to be dispersed among shell companies located around the world. Soon after, it was revealed by Italian anti-Mafia prosecutors that Parmalat paid the Mafia to intimidate its competitors and thus ensure a monopoly of Parmalat products in southern Italy.
  </p>
  <p>
   An Italian judge snubbed parts of Bondi's plan and ruled that some of the largest foreign creditors stood to receive a major share of any equity in the company as it re-emerges from bankruptcy. The ruling placed prickly parties all in the same boat together, along with all their suits and countersuits. The ruling also named
   <company id="58450">
    Wells Fargo &amp; Company
   </company>
   as Parmalat's largest creditor, with US$827 million (€577 million) in claims.
  </p>
  <p>
   Explaining that it intended to do so all along, Parmalat sold off some of its 99% ownership of the Parma A.C. soccer team and its Parmatour travel business. The company had already quietly put its US bakery businesses up for auction several months before the scandal broke.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of his disposal procedure, in January 2005 Bondi invited bids from potential buyers of Parmalat's bakery unit, which includes such brands as Dolcezze di Campo, Grisbi, Matin, Mister Day, and ProntoForno. The Italian Industry Ministry had to, and eventually did, approve any Parmalat sale.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 company shareholders voted to appoint Bondi as CEO (he had been running the company as a government-appointed administrator throughout its bankruptcy), clearing the way for him to settle with the company's banks and auditors. As part of Parmalat's ongoing reorganization, in 2006 it sold its 100% holding in Italcheese as well as its stake in a number of Australian dairy operations. The company said that the proceeds from the Australian sales would be used to reduce its debt to Australian banks.
  </p>
  <p>
   While its Canadian dairy operations remained stable and profitable, the company's US subsidiary (Parmalat USA) filed for bankruptcy protection, citing debts of US$316 million (€221 million). Amid speculation that Parmalat Finanziaria laundered money through its Parmalat Brazil dairy business, that unit sought bankruptcy protection. Parmalat de México had its accounts frozen briefly, but resumed normal operations before agreeing to sell its industrial operations to Grupo Industrial Lala. Parmalat Chile declared bankruptcy and was sold to a local investment group in May 2004. Parmalat's Argentina unit was sold to a local businessman in September 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 private equity firm
   <company id="136204">
    Catterton Partners
   </company>
   acquired Parmalat's North American bakery operations, including such brands as Archway and Mother's cookies. Parmalat USA emerged from bankruptcy in April 2005 under the name
   <company id="113861">
    Farmland Dairies
   </company>
   . (It no longer belongs to Parmalat.) Later that year Parmalat sold its premium chocolate company, Sterglio, to Borsci Industria Liquori for approximately US$3 million (about €2 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquiring enough money to pay its creditors is one of the main focuses at Parmalat. The company sold off a swath of its operations, including all of its Spanish operations (regular and flavored milk, ice cream, yogurt, and desserts), to Lactos Siglo for €188 million ($253 million) in 2007, and its fruit-juice and tomato- and tea-based beverage business, Boschi Luigi &amp; Figli, along with its Pomi, Pomito, and Pais brands, to a company owned by Consorzio Interregionale Ortofrutticolo and Consorzio Casalasco. The purchase price for Luigi &amp; Figli was €30.2 million ($40.6 million); the purchase price for the Pomi, Pomito, and Pais brands was €2.3 million ($3 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its rebuilding efforts, Parmalat in 2009 acquired some fresh milk operations of National Foods, including the Lidcombe and Clarence Gardens plants, along with the pertinent marketing licenses for the brands and distribution networks in New South Wales, South Australia, and Australia Capital Territory. Parmalat paid about A$70 million ($54 million) in cash for the acquisition.
  </p>
  <p>
   In its effort to become the world's top dairy company,
   <company id="54346">
    Lactalis
   </company>
   launched a €3.4 billion ($4.9 billion) takeover bid for Parmalat in early 2011. Lactalis took control of its Italian rival after winning nine of 11 board seats at a Parmalat shareholder meeting in July. Lactalis's takeover of Parmalat foiled attempts backed by the Italian governement and Italian investors to keep the firm in domestic hands.
