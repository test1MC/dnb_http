   K-Swiss refuses to remain neutral in the sports shoe wars. The company designs and sells running, tennis, and training shoes, including high-performance footwear for triathletes, for men, women, and children under the K-Swiss and Palladium brands. K-Swiss also sells sports apparel and accessories. The company is famous for the
   <em>
    K-Swiss Classic
   </em>
   , the white, all-weather, leather tennis shoe that was introduced in 1966 by K-Swiss' founders. K-Swiss products are marketed to upscale buyers and made by independent suppliers -- primarily in China -- and are sold worldwide in department and specialty retail stores, as well as online. Amid sagging sales, in 2013 K-Swiss was acquired by South Korea's E. Land World.

  <p>
   In 2013 South Korean retail giant E. Land World paid about $170 million, or $4.75 per share, for K-Swiss. (The price was a 49% premium to K-Swiss' closing price at the time of the offer.) E. Land manages some 200 brands and operates more than 10,000 stores globally.

  <p>
   California-based K-Swiss rings up only about a third of its sales in the US, while Europe, Asia, as well as other foreign countries, account for the rest.

   The company sells through online retailers such as
   <company id="51493">
    Amazon
   </company>
   and
   <company id="112806">
    Zappos
   </company>
   . It also sells via its own website.

   In 2015, K-Swiss partnered with DJ, producer, and entrepreneur Diplo to launch 'The Board', a program built to inspire the next generation of young entrepreneurs.

   Prior to its deal with E. Land World, K-Swiss looked to acquisitions to revive its business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2010 it bought FORM Athletics, a Mixed Martial Arts and lifestyle brand, aimed at younger customers. Laguna Beach, California-based FORM became a division of K-Swiss and its founder and CEO was charged with establishing a new division focused on youth. (FORM's revenue contribution to the company so far is negligible.) Previously, K-Swiss acquired France-based Palladium, a maker and marketer of fashion footwear in Europe under the Palladium brand. The purchase of the French firm internationalized K-Swiss.
  </p>
  <p>
   K-Swiss was founded in 1966 by two Swiss brothers who moved to California to pursue their dream of starting their own footwear company.
  </p>

  <p>
   Swiss brothers Art and Ernest Brunner founded K-Swiss (they came from a province the name of which began with a K) in 1966. That year they introduced the Classic -- a simple shoe made from three pieces of leather and marketed to tennis players. Over the next 20 years the shoe remained essentially unchanged.
  </p>
  <p>
   Former Stride-Rite executive Steven Nichols led a buyout of K-Swiss in 1986. He expanded offerings to include basketball, boating, and hiking shoes, but new styles remained closely related to the Classic. By 1990 there were more than 20 K-Swiss styles. Sales grew, too, increasing 72% in 1989, and in 1990 K-Swiss went public.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991 the firm focused on sales in Asia and the UK and shifted production to Asia. The following year it opened a sales office in Amsterdam, and in 1993 the company added aerobics shoes and cross trainers to its line. (K-Swiss no longer makes shoes specifically for aerobics or basketball.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Competition pushed sales down in 1995 and 1996, but things began to look up in 1997 as the company's shoes became hip in the inner cities and the new tennis line, the 7.0 System, was well received by retailers. Jumping to take advantage of its new trendiness, that year K-Swiss placed ads on MTV and in
   <i>
    Vibe
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Rolling Stone.
   </i>
   In 1998 it declined to sponsor the US Open tennis tournament for the first time in years, choosing to spend those marketing dollars on amateur camps and clinics. K-Swiss doubled its ad budget and launched a campaign featuring promising young athletes in 1999. In 2000 the company made a rare step out of Classics and introduced a training line.
  </p>
  <p>
   In May 2001 K-Swiss formed a joint venture with Rugged Shark to create a line of licensed National Geographic casual and outdoor shoes and boots that were introduced in the fall of 2002. In November 2001 K-Swiss acquired Royal Elastics, an Australian-based maker of slip-on sneakers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In June 2008 Payless and its parent company Collective Brands agreed to pay
   <company id="13001">
    K-Swiss
   </company>
   $30 million in compensatory damages and to refrain from making or selling footwear "confusingly similar" to that sold by K-Swiss. In July the company acquired 57% of France-based Palladium, a maker and marketer of fashion footwear in Europe under the Palladium brand. (In June 2009 it bought the remaining 43% of Palladium for about the same price.)  Separately, K-Swiss in May 2008 acquired the Palladium trademark for use in the US and Canada for $6 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In April 2009 the company sold the assets of its Royal Elastics brand (acquired in 2001) of elasticized footwear for about $1.3 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In July 2010 K-Swiss acquired surf-and-skate inspired FORM Athletics LLC, a Mixed Martial Arts and lifestyle brand, for about $1.6 million.
