  <p>
   The Fluid &amp; Metering Technologies segment (43% of total sales) is made up of such business units as Banjo (special-purpose, severe-duty pumps, valves, and fittings); Energy &amp; Fuels (including
   <company id="60356">
    Liquid Controls
   </company>
   ); Chemical, Food &amp; Process, Diaphragm &amp; Dosing Pump Technology; and Water Services &amp; Technology. This segment serves a range of markets, including agriculture, chemical processing, food and beverage, industrial infrastructure (fossil and alternative fuels), plastics, pulp and paper, transportation, and water and wastewater.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Health &amp; Science Technologies segment (36%) consists of Scientific Fluidics; IDEX Optics &amp; Photonics; Containment; Gast; Micropump; and Materials Process Technologies (including
   <company id="17020">
    Microfluidics
   </company>
   and
   <company id="130163">
    Quadro Engineering
   </company>

   After its revenues reached a record-setting high of $2.15 billion in 2014, IDEX saw its revenues fall 6% to $2.02 billion in 2015. The decline was fueled by a 16% dip in Fire &amp; Safety/Diversified Products segment sales. This was attributed to declines in organic growth and unfavorable foreign currency translations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dispensing platform products decreased in 2015 due to the absence of large projects in the second half of the year and a softness in Asian markets. In addition, band-it platform sales were affected by a decline of upstream oil and gas sales, due to depressed prices. Sales for Fire Suppression products decreased due to a lack of project orders in China and North America and continued decision delays on municipal projects in Europe and Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's profits have remained consistent over the years, hovering around the $380 million mark for 2014 and 2015. Its 2015 profits were buoyed by the presence of gains on a sale related to the selling of a product line and a decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses.

  <p>
   IDEX's strategy is to grow through organic investments and acquisitions. In 2016 the company completed the acquisition of Akron Brass Holding Corporation for $224 million. Akron Brass was added to its Fire &amp; Safety/Diversified segment and will provide its customers in the global firefighting industry with an expanded product portfolio offering.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company acquired two companies based in Italy: Novotema, SpA, a maker of specialty sealing equipment and products; and Alfa Valvole, s.r.l., a maker of specialty valve products used in the chemical, petrochemical, energy and sanitary markets. Novotema enhanced the company's Health &amp; Science Technologies segment, while Alfa added to its Fluid &amp; Metering Technologies offerings.

  <p>
   IDEX is the successor of Houdaille (pronounced "WHO-dye") Industries, which took its name from Maurice Houdaille, the French inventor of recoilless artillery used in World War I. After that war a US firm bought the name and the rights to Houdaille's patented rotary shock absorber. By the 1930s Houdaille was the #1 maker of shock absorbers in the US. During WWII it was involved in building the atomic bomb.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the trend toward in-house manufacture by the auto giants in the 1950s, the company diversified into industrial and construction products, pumps, and machine tools. Facing difficult economic conditions, Phil Reilly (Houdaille's then CEO-nominee) and investors Kohlberg Kravis Roberts took the company private in 1979 in the first leveraged buyout of any company worth more than $100 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1987 IDEX (an acronym for "innovation, diversity, and excellence") was formed to buy back six units Houdaille had sold to the British TI Group earlier that year. In 1989 IDEX went public.
