   Trina Solar follows the light to generate electricity. The company makes silicon-based photovoltaic (PV) modules (ingots, wafers, and solar cells) used in the manufacture of solar panels. At its plant in China, Trina Solar produces 165 W - 185 W monocrystalline PV modules and 215 W - 240 W multicrystalline PV modules. Annually it produces 750 MW each of ingots and wafers and 1,200 MW each of solar cells and PV modules used in residential and commercial applications. Trina Solar sells its products around the globe, but more than 75% of sales come from Europe. Top customers in 2010 include Spain's Proyectos Integrales Solares, Germany's

   Trina Solar was founded in 1997 and developed China's first building-integrated photovoltaic structure by the turn of the century. In 2002 it installed about 40 photovoltaic power stations in Tibet. Two years later is helped draft China's first Renewable Energy Law.

   The company didn't start manufacturing solar products until 2005, when  it built its mono-crystalline ingot manufacturing facility. Trina Solar used funds from its 2006 IPO, which brought in about $98 million, for developing new products and buying raw materials. It also used proceeds for research, as well as the acquisition of other companies and products. In addition, Trina Solar invested in building its own solar cell plant, which opened in 2007.
