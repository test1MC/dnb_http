   Kenexa acquired Salary.com for some $80 million in 2010. It made the deal for Salary.com's compensation management solutions that complement Kenexa's own suite of talent acquisition and retention services, and were later rolled into Kenexa. Salary.com was also attractive for its customer base. The more than 3,700 subscribers to its compensation and talent management products included major corporate clients, such as

    CVS Health

   ,
   <company id="41816">
    News Corporation
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="105009">
    In-n-Out Burgers
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   While the acquisition helped Kenexa grow, the deal also benefited Salary.com, which faced some troubles as a result of the recession -- business declined as customers reduced their hiring. Despite the economic downturn, Salary.com expanded through multiple acquisitions. Having started during the dot com boom as an online salary wizard, the company eventually grew to offer a plethora of HR-related services. As it increased its offerings, its share price plummeted.

   Salary.com was founded in 1999 by Kent Plunkett. It filed an IPO in 2007.
