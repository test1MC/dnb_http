   QLogic keeps its customers on a steady diet of Fibre...Channel. The company designs server and storage system networking products, including switches, adapters, and storage routers. QLogic's products are primarily Fibre Channel and Ethernet-based, but can also operate as Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) products or as a combination of technologies. The company also provides controllers for embedded applications. QLogic uses contract manufacturers to build its products, which are sold directly to server and workstation manufacturers and through distributors. Customers include
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   (more than a quarter of sales),
   <company id="13193">
    Dell
   </company>
   (17%), and
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   (15%). The company was acquired by
   <company id="113482">
    Cavium
   </company>
   in mid-2016.

  <p>
   The company classifies its products in two categories -- advanced connectivity platforms (89% of sales) and legacy connectivity products (11%). Advanced connectivity platforms consist of adapters and ASICs for server and storage connectivity applications. Legacy connectivity products are comprised of Fibre Channel switch products and 1Gb iSCSI products. (iSCSI products are targeted toward small and midsized businesses as a lower-priced alternative to Fibre Channel.)

   QLogic ended a string of three straight years of declining revenue with nearly 13% growth in 2015 (ended March). The company's $520 million revenue in 2015 came from a 20% rise in Advanced Connectivity segment sales. The Legacy Connectivity segment, which posted a 16% sales drop, was beset by fewer units sold at lower prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Qlogic bounced back from a 2014 loss to post a $50.6 million profit in 2015. Besides higher revenue, the company didn't have restructuring charges that marred the 2014 income statement. The company closed 2015 with cash flow at $82.5 million, a $25 million increase from 2014.

   In order to streamline its business, in 2013 the company began restructuring initiatives to drive long-term growth and keep its products on the cutting edge. QLogic reduced its workforce and consolidated several engineering activities. In 2014 it consolidated its Ethernet product roadmap after paying $147 million for Broadcom's 10/40/100Gb Ethernet controller-related assets and a one-time fee of $62 million for a patent license for Broadcom's Fibre Channel products. In early 2014 it paid about $10 million for the converged network adapter business of
   <company id="59439">
    Brocade
   </company>
   . Back in 2012 it sold its InfiniBand product line to
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   for $125 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company took restructuring a step further in 2015, cutting more than 100 jobs and recording $1.2 million in charges.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company had new versions of its NetXtreme II products out for testing at HP, Dell, and IBM in qualification programs. QLogic sees demand for Ethernet connectivity in enterprise and cloud applications.
