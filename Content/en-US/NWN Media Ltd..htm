   NWN Media (formerly North Wales Newspapers) is truly a prince among regional media firms. The company publishes a dozen daily, weekly, and monthly publications, including the oldest newspaper in Wales, the
   <em>
    North Wales Chronicle
   </em>
   , which was established in 1808. Together, the publications reach about 1 million readers each week. Other operations include design and print services and Web sites (special-interest sites and others supporting its print products). Its Direct2Door is a regional distributor of direct marketing materials. The firm was founded in 1848 with the publication of a railway timetable in Oswestry. NWN Media is controlled by the Thomas family, which was involved in the company's early growth.
