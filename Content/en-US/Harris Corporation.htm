  <p>
   Harris reported a 47% jump in revenue to $7.5 billion in 2016 (ended July) with a big assist from the inclusion of Exelis, which Harris acquired in 2015. Revenue from Space and Intelligence Systems increased from business generated by new classified programs, including programs in space superiority and protection. The Electronic Systems segment showed gains from electronic warfare and counter-IED systems. The fast-paced growth of tempered by slowdowns in some DoD programs as well as the energy sector.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income slid 3% to $324 million in 2016 from impairment of goodwill and other assets related to Harris CapRock Communications stemming from the weakened energy market. Costs related to the Exelis acquisition, workforce reductions, and facility consolidation also contributed to the reduced profit.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 cash from operating activities was $924 million, an 8% increase from 2015.

  <p>
   Harris considers its greatest opportunities for growth to be in managed satellite communications, public safety and professional communications, health care IT, and emerging national markets. Affected sectors include energy, maritime, and government. The continued global deployment of the wireless 4G LTE standard will help fuel growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company seeks to find opportunities where it does business in products and geographies by combing products and services in new ways. Hrris also maintains an R&amp;D budget of about 4% of its annual revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Harris sold its Aerostructures business to Albany International for $210 million. With the acquisition of Exelis, Aerostructures fell from Harris' strategic core.

  <p>
   Harris was founded in Niles, Ohio, in 1895 by brothers Alfred and Charles Harris, both jewelers and inventors. Among their inventions was a printing press that became Harris Automatic Press Company's flagship product.
  </p>
  <p>
   Harris remained a small, family-run company until 1944, when engineer George Dively was hired as general manager. Under Dively the company began manufacturing bindery, typesetting, and paper converting equipment while remaining a leading supplier of printing presses. In 1957 Harris merged with typesetter maker Intertype and became known as Harris-Intertype Corporation.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1960s and 1970s Harris-Intertype grew through acquisitions. In 1967 it bought electronics and data processing equipment maker Radiation, a company heavily dependent on government contracts, and relocated to Radiation's headquarters in Melbourne, Florida. The company also bought RF Communications (two-way radios, 1969),

    General Electric
   </company>
   's broadcast equipment line (1972), and UCC-Communications Systems (data processing equipment, 1972).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company changed its name to Harris Corporation in 1974. In 1980 Harris bought Farinon, a manufacturer of microwave radio systems, and Lanier Business Products, the leading maker of dictating equipment. In 1983 it sold its printing equipment business.
