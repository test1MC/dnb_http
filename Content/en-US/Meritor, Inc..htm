  <p>
   Meritor divides its activities into Commercial Truck &amp; Industrial, and Aftermarket &amp; Trailer.
  </p>
  <p>

It also includes aftermarket operations in the Asia/Pacific region and South America.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Aftermarket &amp; Trailer segment supplies replacement parts to commercial and industrial aftermarket customers in North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Commercial Truck &amp; Industrial segment is its most lucrative, representing around 75% of total sales. The Aftermarket &amp; Trailer segment generates the remaining 25%.
  </p>
  <p>

   <company id="159469">

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Based in Troy, Michigan, Meritor has segments and joint ventures operating across North America, Europe, South America, and the Asia/Pacific region. North America accounted for about 60% of the company's revenue in 2015.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Meritor targets customers in the commercial truck, trailer, off-highway, defense, and aftermarket sectors. The ten largest customers account for around 75% of sales, and include Volvo (some 23% of sales), Daimler AG (18%), and
   <company id="111076">
    Navistar
   </company>
   (9%).
  </p>
  <p>
   It designs, engineers, markets and sells products principally to OEMs (original equipment manufacturer), dealers and distributors.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Meritor's revenue has been on a downward trend in recent years. Revenue fell 9% to $3.2 billion in fiscal 2016, as lower production in the North America Class 8 truck market dragged on the Commercial Truck &amp; Industrial segment. The strength of the US Dollar against the Euro and the Brazilian Real also weighed on growth. The sales decrease was partially offset by new business wins and higher market volumes in India.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income rocketed 795% to $573.0 million due to a non-cash income tax benefit of $438 million relating to a valuation allowance reversal. The absence of restructuring costs also contributed to the healthy figure.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operations rose 110% to $204.0 million, due to higher net income and changes in working capital.

  <p>
   Meritor was spun off from
   <company id="11283">
    Rockwell Automation
   </company>
   in 1997 and known as Meritor Automotive until 2000, when it acquired
   <company id="10132">
    Arvin Industries
   </company>
   and changed its name to ArvinMeritor. After 11 years as ArvinMeritor, the company changed its name back to Meritor, Inc. in 2011. Both companies can trace their roots to auto parts makers founded in the early 20th century.
