   The making of bleach and bullets is all in a day's work for Olin Corporation. The company manufactures chemicals used to make bleach, water purification and swimming pool chemicals, pulp and paper processing agents, and PVC plastics.
   <company id="131730">
    Olin Chlor Alkali Products
   </company>
   is one of the top chlor-alkali producers in North America along with
   <company id="104705">
    OxyChem
   </company>
   . Olin also distributes caustic soda, vinyls, epoxies, chlorinated organics, hydrochloric acid, and bleach. In addition, in a quite divergent business, the company's
   <company id="131077">
    Winchester Ammunition
   </company>
   unit makes branded sporting ammunition, reloading components, small caliber military ammunition and components, and industrial cartridges.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates in three business segments:
   <company id="131730">
    Olin Chlor Alkali Products
   </company>
   (commercial co-production of chlorine, caustic soda, and hydrogen by the electrolysis of salt) which accounted for 60% of 2015 sales; the Epoxy segment (15%), which produces and sells a full range of epoxy materials, including allyl chloride, epichlorohydrin, liquid epoxy resins and downstream products such as converted epoxy resins and additives; and
   <company id="131077">
    Winchester Ammunition
   </company>
   (25%, a venerable arms maker with a famous name, and a premier developer and manufacturer of small caliber ammunition for sale to retailers, law enforcement agencies, and militaries).
  </p>
  <p>
   Chlor alkali manufacturers in North America (with 18 million tons of chlorine and 19 million tons of caustic soda capacity) account for approximately 17% of worldwide chlor alkali production capacity.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has plants in  across the US (Augusta, Georgia; California; Illinois; Mississippi; McIntosh, Alabama; Charleston, Tennessee; St. Gabriel, Louisiana; Henderson, Nevada; Niagara Falls, New York); and in Canada (Becancour, Quebec). It also has a facility in Australia that loads and packs sporting and industrial ammunition. The company also own three terminals in three US states and leases 26 terminal facilities in 19 states and in Canada. It also has plants and facilities in Germany, Brazil, South Korea, Italy, and China.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the US accounted for 77% of Olin's revenues.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Olin markets most of its products and services through its own sales force and sells directly to various industrial customers, mass merchants, retailers, wholesalers, and other distributors, as well as the US government, and its prime contractors.
  </p>
  <p>
   The products from Epoxy segment and Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls are delivered primarily by marine vessels, deep-water and coastal barges, railcars, and trucks.
  </p>
  <p>
   The end users of products and services of the Epoxy segment are manufacturers of polymers, resins and other plastic materials, water purification, and pesticides, adhesives, paint and coatings, composites and flooring.
  </p>
  <p>
   Winchester's sales and distribution chain has strong ties to traditional dealers and distributors.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 Olin's net revenues stood at $2.85 billion, up 27% on 2014 due to an increase in Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and the addition of Epoxy sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls increased due to the inclusion of the acquired Chlor Alkali business, partially offset by lower product prices and lower volumes of chlorine and caustic soda, potassium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid. The lower product prices were due to caustic soda and bleach prices, partially offset by higher chlorine prices. The acquired business (the newly created Epoxy segment) had sales of $429.6 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Olin has recorded a declining trend in net income over the last five years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company incurred net loss of $1.4 million (against net income of $105.7 million in 2014) due to a sharp increase in acquisition-related costs and higher selling and administration expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities was $217.1 million (up 36%) due to a change in accounts receivable and accounts payable for the acquired Epoxy business.

  <p>
   Olin seeks to strengthen its position as a preferred supplier of chlor alkali products to merchant market customers though internal expansion and complementary acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company continues to leverage its legendary Winchester brand, with its reputation of innovation (such as introducing reduced-lead and non-lead products), to improve its position as a major supplier of ammunition. The Winchester division is planning to relocate its centerfire ammunition operations from East Alton, Illinois to lower-cost Oxford, Mississippi by the end of 2016, to reduce Winchester's annual operating costs by about $30 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has invested in capacity and product upgrades in chemically processed salt, hydrochloric acid, bleach, potassium hydroxide, and hydrogen businesses to expand its captive use of chlorine, while increasing the sales of these co-products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Olin closed a portion of the Becancour, Canada chlor alkali facility and stopped using mercury cell technology in the chlor alkali manufacturing process.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Geographically growing its portfolio, in 2015 the company bought certain chlor alkali and downstream derivatives businesses from Dow Chemical in a deal valued at about $5 billion. Following the purchase of the Chlor Alkali and Vinyl, Global Chlorinated Organics and Global Epoxy businesses from Dow, Olin realigned its operating segments, creating the new Epoxy segment.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Vermont-born engineer Franklin Olin founded Equitable Powder in East Alton, Illinois, in 1892 to make blasting powder for midwestern coal fields. By 1898 the company, called Western Cartridge, was also making ammunition for small arms.
  </p>
  <p>
   When WWI increased demand for military cartridges, Western Cartridge built a brass mill. After the war it began making custom brass and other copper alloys for industrial customers. The company bought Winchester Repeating Arms, maker of the famous Winchester Model 1876 repeating rifles, in 1931. During WWII Western Cartridge developed the US carbine and M-1 rifles.
  </p>
  <p>
   The various businesses of Western Cartridge merged as Olin Industries in 1944. Franklin then retired, handing the company to sons John and Spencer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Enriched by the war effort, Olin Industries grew. In 1949 it began making cellophane, and in 1951 it acquired Frost Lumber Industries and Ecusta Paper, a maker of cigarette papers. Olin Industries merged with Mathieson Chemical in 1954 to form Olin Mathieson Chemical, the fifth-largest US chemical company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Mathieson Alkali Works was founded in Saltville, Virginia, in 1892 to produce alkalis using a process acquired from English chemical firm Neil Mathieson. By 1909 the company began producing liquid chlorine, and in 1923 it built one of the earliest plants for producing synthetic ammonia. During WWII Mathieson manufactured chlorine for water purification and alkali chemicals for sanitation. In 1952 Mathieson acquired drugmaker Squibb.
  </p>
  <p>
   Olin Mathieson continued to diversify in the mid-1950s, buying Blockson Chemical (industrial phosphates) and Brown Paper Mill (kraft paper bags and corrugated cardboard containers). Frost Lumber and Brown Paper Mill formed the Forest Products Division, later dubbed Olinkraft. In 1956 Olin Mathieson entered the aluminum business via a joint venture -- just in time for a drop in aluminum demand.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1960s the company began making urethane chemicals. It also created Olin-American, a subsidiary that built houses, and spun off Squibb. In 1969 it shortened its name to Olin Corporation and moved to Stamford, Connecticut.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1970s saw Olin reining in its diverse businesses. It spun off Olinkraft and sold its aluminum operations. During the 1980s Olin sold its sporting-arms business (but kept Winchester ammunition), as well as its paper, housing, and cellophane units. John Olin died in 1982. The company acquired Rockcor, which included Rocket Research, Pacific Electro Dynamics, and Physics International, in 1985.
  </p>
  <p>
   Olin moved its headquarters to Norwalk, Connecticut, in 1995, the same year Spencer Olin died. In 1996, as the earnings potential of its ordnance and aerospace operations lagged, Olin spun them off as Primex Technologies. It also sold its isocyanate (used in plastics and adhesives) and other cyclical businesses. Olin bought the remaining 50% of its Niachlor chlor alkali joint venture from DuPont in 1997 after considering putting Niachlor up for sale.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aspiring to become a leading basic-materials company, Olin spun off its specialty chemical business in early 1999 under the name
   <company id="59140">
    Arch Chemicals
   </company>
   . Citing regulatory issues, Olin cancelled plans in 2000 to form a chlor alkali chemicals joint venture with Occidental's OxyChem subsidiary. Olin acquired Monarch Brass &amp; Copper Corp. for about $49 million in 2001. The next year it bought brass rod maker
   <company id="42272">
    Chase Industries
   </company>
   . Olin closed its copper and copper alloy sheet plant in Indianapolis in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Olin grew its core chemicals business, acquiring chlor-alkali producer
   <company id="51864">
    Pioneer Companies
   </company>
   for about $415 million. To help pay for the deal, in late 2007 Olin sold its former Metals unit to investment group
   <company id="108940">
    KPS Capital Partners
   </company>
   for almost $400 million. The Metals unit -- which had accounted for about two-thirds of sales -- made copper and copper alloy sheets, clad metal, foil, and stainless-steel strips.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Olin acquired the balance of the SunBelt Chlor Alkali joint venture it did not own from partner PolyOne Corp. for $175 million in cash and assumed debt. It had held a 50% stake in the venture, which produces chlorine and caustic soda. The SunBelt chlor alkali plant, located within Olin's McIntosh, Alabama facility, has approximately 350,000 tons of membrane technology capacity and generated some $70 million in earnings in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company in 2012 acquired Illinois-based KA Steel for $328 million in cash. KA Steel is one of the largest caustic soda distributors in North America, and its acquisition increased Olin's capacity to manufacture bleach by about 20%, as well as to sell some of its other products, such as hydrochloric acid and potassium hydroxide. A result the purchase Olin formed a chemical distribution segment that year.
