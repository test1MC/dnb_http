   In response to growing exploitation of China's shale gas reserves, in 2014 Sany launched a new field a set of petroleum equipment. During the 14th China International Petroleum &amp; Petrochemical Technology and Equipment Exhibition, Sany displayed a set of petroleum equipment including  a Model 2500 fracturing truck, a Model 2000 fracturing truck, a  150-barrel fracturing blender, and a measuring truck.

   The company's globalization efforts are relatively new. Sany America's US headquarters opened in 2011 in Peachtree City, a suburb about 30 miles southwest of Atlanta. The company's 420,000-sq.-ft., $60 million manufacturing plant employs 200 people and houses sales, service, assembly, testing, distribution, and R&amp;D operations. Workers there will build five concrete pump crane models. In order to grow the little-known brand in the US, Sany America plans to make a name for itself at conventions, participate in the government procurement bidding process, and sponsor charity events.
