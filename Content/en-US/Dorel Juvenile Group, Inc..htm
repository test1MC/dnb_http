   Sales by Dorel Juvenile Group (DJG) fell 5% in 2013 versus 2012, to $992.9 million, on economic weakness and a slower retail climate in certain markets, particularly Europe and North America. (DJG accounted for 41% of its parent company's total sales.) Latin America was a bright spot with Chile and Peru performing well, and improvement in Brazil. DJG's operating profit declined 22% year over year, to $57.2 million, or 6% of sales.

   , one of the largest juvenile product makers in China. Dorel Industries has agreed to pay HK$930 million ($120 million) for the business, which manufactures a wide range of juvenile products. the pending purchase, which is expected to close by the end of the year, will give Dorel more control over its supply chain.

   During 2012 a comprehensive plan was implemented at Dorel Juvenile Group (DJG) USA to improve performance and Dorel Europe put in a solid performance despite economic woes there. In 2013, Latin America was the company's growth engine. Indeed, during the past five years, Dorel has broadened its Juvenile segment from its traditional base in North America and Europe by acquiring majority interests in businesses in Australia and Latin America.
