   Infogroup expands its services through acquisitions. In 2012 it acquired GoTime, the creator of a mobile app that allows users to find happy hours at local bars in dozens of cities. It made the deal to gain GoTime's technology platform that powers local content and real-time data management. With the GoTime purchase, the company launched its new proprietary real-time data system called Data Axle.
  </p>
  <p>
   Before the GoTime acquisition, Infogroup worked to strengthen its brand and position in the market in 2011 by introducing a new logo, integrating several business units, and consolidating its Omaha workforce under one roof. As part of these efforts, it divested two major divisions. In 2011 it sold its subsidiary
   <company id="16289">
    ORC International
   </company>
   , which managed engagement research and consulting services. The next year it sold business information provider
   <company id="47506">
    OneSource Information Services
   </company>
   . It made the reorganization to streamline its core business around developing and delivering data products and services to its clients.
  </p>
  <p>
   This marks a shift from its previous strategy, when Infogroup built itself up through a series of acquisitions designed to transform it from a lists-and-labels company into a full-service information provider. It bolstered its direct e-mail services through the acquisition of Yesmail. Its acquisition of direct marketing firm
   <company id="102858">
    Direct Media Millard
   </company>
   further strengthened the company's list brokerage, list management, analytics, database marketing, and data processing services.

   Formerly a public company, Infogroup was sold to private investor
   <company id="153771">
    CCMP Capital
   </company>
   in 2010 for about $460 million. CCMP stated that it was attracted to Infogroup's cost-effective marketing tools. The change in ownership came after Infogroup founder Vinod Gupta, who previously owned about 40% of the firm, was forced out in a scandal. Infogroup faced an
   <company id="56705">
    SEC
   </company>
   investigation related to securities trading and a shareholder lawsuit concerning Gupta's alleged misspending of company funds. Gupta eventually resigned and the company ended up settling with the SEC.

  <p>
   Vinod Gupta and Glen Humphrey got started in the database business in 1972 with $100 and a stack of Yellow Pages. Through their company, American Business Information (ABI), the two compiled business listings into manufacturing directories and state business directories. ABI had every US Yellow Pages directory in its database by 1986. The company went public in 1992, the same year it formed a joint venture with conglomerate TRW to provide customers with marketing and credit information.
  </p>
  <p>
   To expand its product line and distribution channels, ABI began acquiring related companies in 1993. Two years later it made its database available on America Online (later
   <company id="15558">
    AOL
   </company>
   ), the
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   Network, and
   <company id="40671">
    Bloomberg
   </company>
   financial terminals. It launched its own website in 1996. During the next year ABI bought six more companies, including Database America for $100 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a surprise move, the hands-on, entrepreneurial Gupta stepped back from his CEO duties in 1997 and appointed Scott Dahnke, a McKinsey consultant, as his replacement. The next year ABI failed in its bid to acquire consumer database company Metromail for $918 million (it was bought by UK-based Great Universal Stores). It later changed its name to infoUSA and launched VideoYellowPages.com, a website to provide pictures of businesses along with their yellow pages advertisement.
  </p>
  <p>
   When infoUSA posted big losses, Dahnke was ousted in 1998 and Gupta came back as CEO. The company bought
   <company id="14441">
    First Data
   </company>
   's Donnelley Marketing division in 1999, and continued building online distribution units like listbazaar.com and businessCreditUSA.com. However, losses from the investments began piling up in 2000 and investors soured on ad-supported Internet sites. The company closed down and consolidated some of its online ventures in 2001 and cut some 500 people from its workforce. Previous CFO Stormy Dean found time to run for governor of Nebraska in 2002 (he lost the election and resigned from infoUSA the following year to pursue a political career full time).
  </p>
  <p>
   infoUSA next began working to transform itself from a lists-and-labels company into a full-service information provider. After buying direct e-mail services company
   <company id="60070">
    yesmail
   </company>
   from
   <company id="16748">
    CMGI
   </company>
   in 2003, the company expanded its database holdings by acquiring business information provider
   <company id="47506">
    OneSource Information Services
   </company>
   for about $100 million. infoUSA also acquired list brokerage firm
   <company id="130914">
    Edith Roman Associates
   </company>
   in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gupta made a $630 million bid to take the company private in 2005, but infoUSA's board rejected the offer. In 2006 it fought a hostile takeover attempt by shareholder Dolphin Partners.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's acquisition of
   <company id="16289">
    Opinion Research Corp.
   </company>
   added research services to Infogroup. The 2006 purchase of Opinion Research, a provider of market research services to business and government clients, cost Infogroup about $134 million, including the assumption of debt. Opinion Research provides customer surveys, opinion polling, and other market research services for clients. Infogroup then moved quickly to expand that business through the 2007 purchase of
   <company id="45535">
    Guideline
   </company>
   , a provider of custom business and market research and analysis, for approximately $42 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2008 Infogroup acquired direct marketing firm
   <company id="102858">
    Direct Media Millard
   </company>
   . The deal expanded its reach in list brokerage, list management, analytics, database marketing, and data processing services. Reflecting its strategy of reaching out to new global markets, the company changed its name to Infogroup from infoUSA in 2008. After the company separated the duties of chairman and CEO, Gupta resigned from his executive position and Bill Fairfield was appointed the new CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gupta, who previously owned about 40% of the firm, was actually forced out in a scandal. Infogroup faced an
   <company id="56705">
    SEC
   </company>
   investigation related to securities trading and a shareholder lawsuit concerning Gupta's alleged misspending of company funds. The lawsuit alleged the company misspent millions, some of it on former President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. (Gupta was a major donor to the Democratic Party.) In addition to resigning, Gupta agreed to pay the company $9 million. Infogroup also settled with the SEC. The company did not admit wrongdoing or pay a penalty, but did impose tighter limits on spending and pledged to ensure accurate records and maintain internal accounting controls going forward.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the company previously achieved growth through acquisitions, it did not make any purchases in 2009.  It did, however, sell its health and human resource information business, Macro International, to
   <company id="111160">
    ICF International
   </company>
   for some $155 million that year. The company made the divestiture because Macro International was a non-core business. The 2009 sale, along with the lack of acquisitions that year, was symptomatic of the company's decline in sales, a result of the weakened economy.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 the company was acquired by CCMP Capital Advisors.  Former Dow Jones executive Clare Hart was named president and CEO that year. In 2011 the company consolidated several business units its through a reorganization. Later that year it sold ORC International. In 2012 it acquired mobile app maker GoTime, using the deal to launch Data Axle, its new proprietary data platform.
