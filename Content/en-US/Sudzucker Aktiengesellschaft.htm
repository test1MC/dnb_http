   Südzucker knows you can't get blood from a turnip, but it definitely knows you can get
   <em>
    zucker
   </em>
   (sugar) from a beet. Producing some 5 million tons of sugar a year, the company is one of the world's largest sugar producers. Südzucker and its partially owned affiliate,
   <company id="93056">
    AGRANA
   </company>
   , and subsidiaries, Raffinerie Tirlemontoise and Saint Louis Sucre, make frozen entrees and pizzas; bakery additives such as fruit concentrates, starch products, and sugar substitutes; food-portion-control containers; and bioethanol. Southern German beet farmers control Südzucker's largest shareholder, Süddeutsche Zuckerrüben-Verwertungsgenossenschaft ("SZVG"), which holds more than 55% of company shares.

  <p>
   Created by the 1926 merger of five sugar makers in southern Germany, then-named Süddeutsche Zucker AG had factories in more than ten cities. Prior to WWII, the company had expanded its holdings to include beet farms and a handful of other food makers. During the war, the company's headquarters were destroyed and prime beet farmland wound up under the control of Russia. After the war, the company rebuilt its main office and retrofitted its factories to accommodate imported raw cane sugar until domestic beet production was able to return to post-war levels.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of post-war reconstruction, in 1950 southern German beet farmers banded together to form Süddeutscher Zuckerrüben-Verwertungsgenossenschaft (SVZG), a holding company with the goal of building a new sugar factory. Under pressure from the government following WWII, in 1951 Süddeutsche Zucker entered a joint venture with SVZG to build a new factory, Zuckerfabrik Franken GmbH, and granted the farmers 51% ownership. As beet production grew throughout the 1950s, both companies built additional new factories; Süddeutsche Zucker sold off non-sugar holdings to finance the growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   Again seeking to diversify, the company began acquiring shares of other non-sugar companies, starting with part of Milchhof-Eiskrem (milk, ice cream) in the mid-1980s. When Süddeutsche Zucker merged with Zuckerfabrik Franken in 1988, the company was renamed Südzucker AG and became the largest German sugar maker. The farmers of SVZG would eventually come to hold 55% of Südzucker's shares. Zuckerfabrik brought with it half of the German ice cream maker, the Schöller group (which is now owned by
   <company id="41815">
    Nestlé
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   German reunification in 1990 brought Südzucker opportunity in the form of selling more sugar to industrial users, ready to serve processed products to hungry consumers. The company created a new subsidiary to oversee acquisitions of sugar manufacturers in the former East Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   Further afield, Südzucker began acquiring shares of other European companies including Austria's
   <company id="93056">
    AGRANA
   </company>
   (sugar and starch, 1989) and Belgium's Raffinerie Tirlemontoise (sugar, artificial sweeteners, 1990). Through AGRANA the company took control of Austria's sugar market, and gained a significant share of Hungary's as well. The expansion led to Südzucker becoming the largest sugar producer in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   To better manage its growing non-sugar and processed foods businesses, in 1994 Schöller Holding GmbH, was formed with Südzucker holding 65% of its shares. Theo Spettmann was tapped to lead Südzucker in 1995. Reaching out, the company acquired ice cream companies in Denmark and Turkey (1997), and the balance of Freiberger (frozen pizza, pasta, 1998) that it didn't yet own. The company also sold off its bakery businesses that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   As privatization spread through Eastern Europe, during 1998 and 1999 Südzucker began purchasing sugar factories in Poland and Moldavia. The purchase of Austria's PrimAS strengthened the company's frozen pizza business across Europe. In 2001 Südzucker purchased French rival Saint Louis Sucre S.A. In 2002 Sudzucker's bid to buy French sugar company

   </company>
   was met with a counter offer from a cooperative of French beet growers. The company did, however, acquire Paris-based Saint Louis Sucre and sold Schöller Holding.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Südzucker acquired Belgian frozen fruit company, Dirafrost Frozen Food Industry. That year the company also announced the reorganization of its Polish sugar plants into one business unit called Slaski Cukier.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of the European sector of its ethanol activities, in 2006 the company acquired the outstanding shares in Ryssen Group (in which Saint Louis Sucre has an investment of approximately 50%). Ryssen operates a plant that dehydrates and rectifies raw ethanol.
