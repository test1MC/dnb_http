   In 2013 North America contributed 15% of the total sales of parent company
   <company id="41855">
    Akzo Nobel N.V.
   </company>
   (6% down on 2012). Performance Coatings contributed for 38% of its total revenues; Specialty Chemicals, 34%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The parent company's Decorative Paints revenues declined by 3% due to adverse currency effects and divestments. During 2013, Akzo Nobel N.V. reported continued soft demand for Specialty Chemicals, especially for construction-related products, pulp bleaching, and plastics.

  <p>
   To raise cash and to focus on its chemicals and performance coatings businesses, in 2013 the company sold its Building Adhesives business to
   <company id="113936">
    Sika AG
   </company>
   for â‚¬260 million ($338 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Akzo Nobel also divested its Decorative Paints North America unit to
   <company id="11139">
    PPG Industries
   </company>
   for more than $1 billion. Nobel's decorative paints included brands such as Glidden, Ralph Lauren, Devoe, Dulux, and Freshaire Choice.

   In 2012 Akzo Nobel was the primary paint supplier to US-based mega-retailer
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   . Akzo Nobel began developing and manufacturing a portfolio of interior and exterior paints for Wal-Mart's more than 3,500 US stores with the Glidden and ColorPlace brands in 2011. The agreement extended a partnership with Wal-Mart for paints in Puerto Rico and Canada, and for Liquid Nails adhesives in the US. The company also relaunched its Glidden brand in 2011 with US-based partner Home Depot. The brand has become the most widely available paint brand in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In Canada the company marketed decorative paints through major retailers like RONA, which it had been supplying since the mid-1970s. It distributed through other big box stores, independent and company-owned paint stores, and small and midsize outlets. In 2011 the parent company began a rollout of a single global brand identity for its retail consumer paint range with a "Let's Colour" marketing campaign. Canada, which holds a #1 market leadership position in the company's Decorative Paints segment, was chosen as a pilot market. That year the 235 company-owned and franchise stores in Canada were branded with the Dulux name.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was incorporated in 1982 as Akzo America, Inc. and changed its name to Akzo Nobel Inc. in 1994.
