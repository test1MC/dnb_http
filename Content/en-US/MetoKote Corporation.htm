   Boosting its industrial services portfolio, in 2013
   <company id="60168">
    Platinum Equity
   </company>
   acquired MetoKote from
   <company id="153771">
    CCMP Capital
   </company>
   . MetoKote was looking to take advantage of Platinum Equity's international reach and experience working with global companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company added a new powder coat system at its Peru, Illinois facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   Growing its position in the US automotive market, in 2011 the company secured major electrocoating services contracts with
   <company id="41889">
    Toyota
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41853">
    Volkswagen
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 MetoKote expanded into Central Europe with a regional coating center near Mannheim, Germany. The facility is designed to supply electro-deposition coating on tractor components for Germany's leading manufacturer of agricultural equipment,
   <company id="10444">
    John Deere
   </company>
   . The company's 124,000 sq. ft. site features an advanced e-coat operation, capable of coating multiple substrates including steel, aluminum, and iron castings. Though the facility began operations primarily in support of John Deere, MetoKote plans to supply electrocoating services to other customers in the region.
  </p>
  <p>
   That same year, MetoKote moved to expand its Asia operations through a consulting agreement with Foxmark International of Tokyo. The venture is working to expand MetoKote's coating services with Asia/Pacific businesses. Foxmark supports foreign market entry and expansion in the region.
