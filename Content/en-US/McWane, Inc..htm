   As a manufacturer of fire hydrants, McWane is a friend to both firefighters and dogs. But fire plugs represent only a fraction of McWane's broad range of products. Orchestrated through six product groups, McWane's subsidiaries make a line of water distribution solutions including fire hydrants, cast-iron water and sewer pipes, fittings, and compressed air tanks. Its Amerex subsidiary is one of the world's largest makers of fire extinguishers. Subsidiary Manchester Tank makes pressure vessels, from huge propane cylinders to handheld torches. Its M&amp;H Valve Co., a maker of industrial valves for wastewater equipment and fire hydrants, has operated since 1854.

  <p>
   Its broad product portfolio is manufactured through a network of 28 manufacturing plants (including 13 foundries) across North America. It also has 27 sales and distribution offices in Australia, Canada, China, South Korea, the US, and Europe.

  <p>
   McWanes' operating segments include Compressed Air Tanks and Technology, Ductile Iron Pipe, Extinguishers and Propane, Soil Fittings and Couplings, Soil Pipe, Valves and Fire Hydrants, Waterworks, and Waterworks Fittings.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's pipe products serves vital infrastructure markets, including drinking water and sanitation. It also has a division for fire protection products focused on foam and water-based fire extinguishers and hazard alarm devices. The McWane Poles division is focused on supplying ductile iron utility poles to electric utilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   McWanes' products are made from post-consumer materials and are recyclable at the end of their useful life. It annually recycles more than 750,000 tons of scrap iron (the equivalent of 800,000 cars).

  <p>
   Over the years McWane has grown by acquiring troubled companies and turning them around with infusions of better equipment and streamlined management.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also expanding organically to keep up with the growing demand for its products.

  <p>
   In 2014 McWane acquired Zinwave Ltd, a global supplier of in-building wireless coverage products. Zinwave continues to trade as an independent company. Zinwave's UK presence helps to expand McWane's global footprint.

  <p>
   In 2012 McWane acquired control of US-based Nighthawk (a global leader in water infrastructure products). It also bought Synapse Wireless (to help that wireless communications company accelerate its technology expansion and product offerings in the machine-to-machine communications market), and Futurecom Systems Group, Inc., (a leader in the design and manufacture of RF coverage extension systems for public safety networks).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 McWane formed a joint venture to build a foundry in the UAE to serve fast-growing markets in the Middle East and North Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company acquired a majority stake in a Chile-based cylinder maker, forming a joint venture, MTE Cemogas, 70% owned by McWane. That year it also bought Solberg Scandinavian, one of Europe's largest firefighting foam agent makers, and a 12% stake in India's Xindia Steel.

   Although the company asserts that it has an improving worker safety record and its commitment to environmental responsibility, McWane and its former employees have attracted regulatory scrutiny. In 2010, the company agreed to pay $4 million to resolve some 400 federal and state environmental law violations. The

   settlement covered 28 of McWane's manufacturing facilities in 14 states and went to the states of Alabama and Iowa.
  </p>
  <p>
   Established in 1921, McWane continues as a closely held corporation, led by its founder's fourth generation, chairman C. Phillip McWane.
