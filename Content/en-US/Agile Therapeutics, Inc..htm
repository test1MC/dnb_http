   If you'd rather have a patch than The Pill, Agile Therapeutics is positioned to provide. The development-stage pharmaceutical company uses its proprietary SkinFusion patch technology to create hormone-based contraceptive products for women. Its lead candidate is Twirla, a weekly patch that uses the same hormone combination as oral contraceptives but delivers it at a sustained level. It's the first patch to deliver levonorgestrel, a synthetic hormone.  Other products in Agile's pipeline are also contraceptives but with different hormone configurations. The company was formed in 1997 and went public in 2014.

   Agile raised $55 million in its public offering and plans to use the proceeds to expand its partner's manufacturing facilities in Michigan and for product development as well as to repay debt.

   In addition to Twirla, the company's candidates are AG200-ER and AG200-SP, both combination hormone contraceptives, and AG890, a progestin-only contraceptive. It manufactures its candidates in cooperation with manufacturing partner

   , which is located in Michigan.

   The company plans to use its own dedicated sales force to market Twirla and any other products in the US; it will use third-party providers for international sales.

   As a development stage company, Agile hasn't received any revenue while spending heavily on R&amp;D. As of the end of 2013, the company had accumulated losses of $155 million. It expects the losses to continue to continue "for the foreseeable future."

   Like most drug companies without an approved product, Agile plans to continue shepherding its candidates through the

   approval process. Once it has approval, it will assemble a US sales force and seek help commercializing it internationally. R&amp;D will continue to develop additional products and Agile may in-license or acquire other women's health products.
