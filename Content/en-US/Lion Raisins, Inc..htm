   Lion Raisins isn't just lyin' around. The company keeps busy as one of California's largest raisin processors. It grows its own grapes and purchases even more from more than 600 other grape growers. Lion's products include seedless and organic raisins, sugar-coated raisins, raisin paste, and raisin juice concentrate. Lion Raisins sun-dries its grapes and then processes them at its facility in Selma, California. Raisins are packaged under the Lion brand or for private-label customers and are shipped to locations throughout the US, as well as to worldwide destinations. The company was founded in 1903 by Alex Lion and is still owned by the Lion family.
