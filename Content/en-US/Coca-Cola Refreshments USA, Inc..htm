   You can rely on Coca-Cola Refreshments USA (CCR) for "The Real Thing." A subsidiary of the world's largest beverage company,
   <company id="10359">
    The Coca-Cola Company
   </company>
   (TCCC), CCR bottles and distributes Coke, Sprite, Fanta, and other soft drinks, as well as bottled waters (Dasani), and juices and teas throughout the US and Canada. The subsidiary is also licensed by
   <company id="103458">
    Dr Pepper Snapple Group
   </company>
   to distribute Canada Dry, Dr Pepper, Schweppes, and C'Plus beverages. (CCR operates in Canada through its Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada unit.) Formerly Coca-Cola Enterprises, the business was acquired by The Coca-Cola Company and renamed Coca-Cola Refreshments USA.

        <p>
   CCR is part of its parent company's North America operating segment, which includes 67 company-owned beverage production facilities, 10 concentrate and/or syrup manufacturing plants, a juice plant and pair of bottled water facilities, and a single container manufacturing plants. In addition to the bottling operations, CCR serves as its parent's customer service organization for North America. In 2013, CCR sold or distributed 88% of TCCC's unit case volume.

   Acquiring Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE) was part of TCCC's strategy to gain more control of its distribution, a move that enables the drink maker to move its products to market more efficiently and to respond more quickly to changing customer preferences. CCE's domestic bottling and distribution operations comprised about 75% of TCCC's US product volume and almost 100% of Canadian product volume. Prior to the sale, CCE was the world's largest Coke bottler, and it generated about 15% of worldwide sales of Coca-Cola beverages.

        <p>
   Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE) was formed in 1986 when The Coca-Cola Company bought its two largest bottlers -- JTL Corp. and BCI Holdings -- and formed a single corporation. The company went public immediately, though Coca-Cola retained a significant interest in it.
  </p>
        <p>
   CCE set about acquiring smaller bottling concerns across the US and by 1988 the company had become the #1 bottler in the world. The company centralized operations to boost its slim profit margin.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1991 CCE merged with the Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group, the #2 US Coca-Cola bottler. The acquisition cost the ailing CCE $125 million, and led a number of disaffected investors to protest. Johnston executives took control when Summerfield Johnston Jr. (whose grandfather had co-founded the first Coke bottling franchisee) assumed the post of CEO, and Henry Schimberg, a former RC Cola route salesman, became president and COO.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1992 the bottler was reorganized into 10 US operating regions to allow for better control of individual market dynamics. A $1.5 billion public debt offering occurred that year, and the following year the company began looking outward for growth, acquiring Nederland B.V. (the Coca-Cola bottler of the Netherlands) as well as two Tennessee bottlers. In 1994 CCE recorded its first profitable year since 1990.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company reorganized again in 1996, forming four operating groups defined by market and geographic lines. Its acquisitions that year included bottlers in Belgium and France.
  </p>
        <p>
   CCE bought the 51% stake it didn't already own in Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages UK from Cadbury Schweppes for $2 billion in 1997, and it also purchased Coca-Cola's shares in Coca-Cola Beverages Ltd. (Canada's leading bottler) and The Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York.
  </p>
        <p>
   A half-dozen deals in 1998 included the $1.1 billion purchase of Coke Southwest and other bottling acquisitions in the US and Luxembourg worth $355 million. Schimberg became CEO that year.
  </p>
        <p>
   Also in 1998 the bottler expanded its vending-machine business, and many distributors and vending-machine owners (who use CCE as a supplier) complained that the firm was charging lower prices in its own machines than independent owners could for the same products.
  </p>
        <p>
   Bad news came in 1999 when products bottled by CCE in Antwerp, Belgium, and Dunkirk, France, were contaminated by bad carbon dioxide and paint used on wooden pallets to prevent mold. Coca-Cola products were banned or recalled in Belgium, France, and a handful of other European countries for about two weeks, costing the company more than $100 million. Schimberg retired in 1999 and Johnston became CEO again.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1999 CCE acquired seven bottlers in the US for about $628 million and one in Europe. European Commission regulators raided various CCE offices in 1999 and 2000 as part of an investigation into anti-competitive marketing programs.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2000 sales of Coca-Cola products in Belgium recovered to pre-contamination scare levels; the rest of CCE's European sales are recovering more slowly. That same year the company spent about $54 million on four acquisitions in the US and Canada.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2001 Johnston stepped down as CEO, but remained chairman. Vice chairman Lowry Kline was named CEO. That same year, the company bought bottlers Hondo and Herbco Enterprises (collectively known as Herb Coca-Cola, the #3 Coke bottler in the US) for about $1.4 billion. The company also announced plans to lay off 2,000 employees as a result of stagnant sales in North America. In 2002 Kline replaced Johnston as chairman.
  </p>
        <p>
   A banner year for acquisitions, 2002 had CCE acquiring
   <company id="109825">
    Austin Coca-Cola Bottling Company
   </company>
   , Brown's Beverages, Dawson Creek Beverages, the Dr Pepper franchise licenses for parts of Arizona, and the Moark Bottling Company. The next year the company acquired Chaudfrontaine, a Belgium water bottling and distribution company.
  </p>
        <p>
   CCE is interested in broadening its product portfolio; it acquired an approximate 19% stake in and distribution rights for milk products maker
   <company id="104562">
    Bravo Foods International
   </company>
   in 2005.
  </p>
        <p>
   Having held the position for just one year, president and CEO John Alm left the company in early 2006. Chairman (and former company CEO) Lowery Kline took over temporary leadership until John Brock was appointed president and CEO later in the year. (Brock was formerly CEO of
   <company id="47435">
    InBev
   </company>
   and served at Cadbury Schweppes before it spun off its beverage unit as
   <company id="103458">
    Dr Pepper Snapple Group
   </company>
   .) Kline continued as chairman.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company was named (along with the Coca-Cola Company) in a suit brought by independent bottlers in 2006, seeking to bar the two companies from abandoning the tradition in which independent companies that put Coke beverages in bottles and cans also deliver the products to and stack them on the shelves of grocery stores. CCE reached a conditional settlement with Ozarks Coco-Cola and Dr. Pepper Bottling Company, wherein there will be a two-year test involving compensation to independent bottlers for the national warehouse delivery of Coke brands by CCE into the territory of said Coke bottlers (even those not involved in the litigation). The settlement also  limits CCE's local warehouse delivery.
  </p>
        <p>
   In addition, a group of shareholders filed a class-action suit against CCE, claiming that the company's practice of channel-stuffing (forcing extra product onto customers in order to boost revenue) affected CCE's financial condition.
  </p>
        <p>
   The same day that The Coca-Cola Company announced the building of  a $45 million plastic recycling plant in 2007, Coca-Cola Enterprises announced the formation of Coca-Cola Recycling. Based at CCE's Atlanta's corporate base, Coca-Cola Recycling will focus on recovering and recycling Coke packaging materials used in North America. The materials to be recycled include polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic, aluminum, cardboard, and plastic film.
  </p>
        <p>
   Boosting its tea offerings, Coca-Cola Enterprises struck an agreement to begin distributing new flavors of
   <company id="42106">
    AriZona Iced Tea
   </company>
   in 2007. That year it also began distributing
   <company id="10287">
    Campbell
   </company>
   fruit and vegetable juice beverages in the US and Canada under an agreement with TCCC.
  </p>
        <p>
   In late 2010 TCCC acquired Coca-Cola Enterprises and renamed the company Coca-Cola Refreshments USA. It became a subsidiary of TCCC.  The deal gave TCCC much control of its distribution in the US and Canada.
