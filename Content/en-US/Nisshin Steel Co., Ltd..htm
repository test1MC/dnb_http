  <p>
   In fiscal 2014 the company's net revenues increased by 11% due to a growth in sales from third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income was Â¥17.75 million (compared to a loss of $37.3 million in 2013). This was due to higher net sales, a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, a gain on sale of investments in securities and properties, the absence of loss on devaluation of investments in securities, and a retirement benefit expense.

   In 2014 cash from operating activities increased by 8%.
