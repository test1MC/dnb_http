   tronc is hoping print newspapers are not completely dead. The company, formerly known as Tribune Publishing Company, operates 10 daily newspapers in 8 key markets including iconic print entities the
   <em>
    Los Angeles Times
   </em>
   , the
   <em>
    Chicago Tribune
   </em>
   , and the
   <em>
    Baltimore Sun
   </em>
   . Despite its attachment to print, the company has been rolling out a state-of-the-art, mobile-first digital platform for its key news and information brands nationwide. tronc owns a total of more than 60 digital properties and 150 niche publications. Its niche publications include the
   <em>
    Red Eye
   </em>
   in Chicago. In conjunction with its name change in 2016, tronc declared it was a "media company focused on creating and distributing premium content".

   In 2013 Tribune Company filed paperwork with the SEC for a spinoff of its newspaper publishing operations (to form Tribune Publishing) to shareholders and changed the name of its media and digital business to
   <company id="11508">
    Tribune Media
   </company>
   . The transaction, which was completed in the first half of 2014, allowed Tribune Media to focus on its growing television operations and digital properties. Then in 2016 after being pursued for acquisition by rival Gannett, Tribune Publishing secured a round of private financing and changed its name to tronc.
