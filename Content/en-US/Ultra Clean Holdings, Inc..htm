   Ultra Clean Holdings is a pure play in helping computer chip makers keep their manufacturing conditions pristine. The company, which does business as Ultra Clean Technology (UCT), designs, engineers, manufactures, and tests customized gas, liquid, and catalytic steam generation delivery systems used primarily in the production of semiconductors. The company's three biggest customers account for about 76% of revenue. In an effort to reach new markets, UCT uses its expertise in the semiconductor industry to develop tools for the flat-panel display, medical, research, and energy industries. By extending its reach, the company looks to smooth the effects of the highly cyclical chip industry.

  <p>
   UCT functions through wholly owned subsidiaries: Ultra Clean Technology Systems and Service Inc., AIT LLC, and Ultra Clean Technology (Shanghai). The company places its factories near its customers' plants in the US and Asia because of the tight coordination of UCT tools into its customers' products. The company intends to expand its operations in Asia, principally in China and Singapore, to reduce costs.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   UCT has operations in China, Singapore, the Philippines, and in California, Arizona, and Texas in the US. Manufacturing is done at all locations while engineering functions are also conducted in the headquarters in Hayward, California, South San Francisco, California, and Austin, Texas. More than 70% of sales come from customers headquartered in the US. Most of the rest come from Asia, which has accounted for a growing portion UCT's sales in the past three years, reaching about 24% in 2014.

   The business of making semiconductors is highly technical so UCT relies on a direct sales force of more than 80 sales directors, account managers, and sales support staff. The sales staff includes technical sales support and engineers stationed at customers' factories. Three customers accounted for 76% of UCT's sales:
   <company id="12647">
    Applied Materials
   </company>
   , 23%,
   <company id="13941">
    LAM Research
   </company>
   , 38%, and
   <company id="92077">
    ASM
   </company>
   , 15%. In the past three years, Applied Materials and LAM have bought companies that were UCT customers.

  <p>
   Revenue for 2014 increased almost 16% to about $514 million from 2013. Net income rose 9% to $11.3 million in 2014 from 2013. The company shipped product in higher volume as customer demand recovered. UCT also benefited from a new, non-semiconductor customer, GT Advanced Technologies, which makes optical and solar equipment. Among other expenses that ate into profit were higher research and development costs, which rose 1.4% in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations was $30.4 million in 2014, up $500,000 from 2013. The increase came from net income and a decrease in accounts payable.

  <p>
   UCT is working on several fronts to expand work with current clients, develop new clients and diversify beyond semiconductors. The company believes that it can pick up business from OEMs that outsource manufacturing processes. It also has placed factories in lower-cost regions in order to maintain competitive prices for its customers. The company seeks to parlay its experience in developing tools for semiconductor manufacturing to make equipment for companies in the flat panel display, robotic surgery, medical equipment, industrial, and energy industries. It will consider acquisitions that expand the company's geographic reach, gain new customers, increase expand market share and move into new markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company introduced 3D printing capabilities to its southeast Asia plants with an acquisition of privately held Prototype Asia. The acquisition enables UCT produce molds and fixtures for quick-turn production. UCT also signed a licensing deal with Materialise to bring the i.materialise 3D Printing platform to UCT's manufacturing facilities.

  <p>
   In 2015, UCT acquired Marchi, a designer and manufacturer of specialty thermocouples, heaters, and temperature controllers, for $30 million in cash. The acquisition expands UCT's offerings for its existing customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   UCT's acquisition of AIT in 2012 was the largest deal in UCT's history. UCT paid in cash and newly issued common stock totaling about $105 million. The acquisition was to increase UCT's competitive position and market share by diversifying and expanding its customer base and product and service portfolio.
