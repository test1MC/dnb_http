   Within 25-plus years, Adept Technology has evolved from making industrial robots to a lineup of intelligent automation products. Its robots are designed to handle, assemble, test, inspect, and package goods in the electronics, food processing, automotive component, packaging, and pharmaceutical industries. Adept Technology's robots can replicate the movements of human shoulders, elbows, and wrists. The company also makes vision guidance and inspection systems, as well as software that allows operators to control robots from a PC. Adept Technology targets a diverse group of Global 1000 companies, including

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   These segments sell their products on a global scale through an international headquarters located in Dortmund, Germany. Adept also has sales offices in France, Singapore, and Shanghai.
  </p>
        <p>
   Europe accounts for nearly 50% of its sales, while the US generates roughly 25%. Asia and other countries account for the remainder.

        <p>
   Adept operates through two primary business segments: Robotics (about 80% of total sales); and Services and Support (20%).

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Adept sells its products worldwide through a network of systems integrators, distributors, and OEMS in addition to its direct sales force.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Adept's balance sheet has had to adapt as sales in some of its more traditional markets have diminished. Overall revenues nosedived 29% from $66 million in 2012 to $47 million in 2013.
  </p>
        <p>
   Sales from its Robotics segment plummeted 34% during 2013, while Services and Support sales declined 8%. The declines were the result of cyclical downturns, an ongoing weak economy in Europe, and decreased levels of capital investment in the solar and disk drive markets.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company has also suffered five straight years of net losses, the most recent being a $10 million loss in 2013. It cites expenses related to acquisitions and restructuring and goodwill impairment charges as reasons for the erosion of profits over the years.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   To become profitable again, the company is concentrating its resources on a number of intelligent robotics systems that cater to growth markets. On Adept's radar: global packaging (food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals), disk drive and consumer electronics, medical, and solar industries. The US and Asian solar industries represent another key to Adept Technology's future. The company has developed a vision-guided system for the solar wafer unloading process which is plans to sell to solar wafer manufacturers.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Adept has been fortifying its Robotics segment through acquisitions. In 2011 it obtained Denmark-based InMoTx, a company that develops automation technology for food processing applications including inspecting, sorting, grading, and hygienic packaging. Additionally, the company is capitalizing on the capabilities of

    MobileRobots
   </company>
   (MRI), acquired in mid-2010. MRI specialized in autonomous robots and automated guided vehicle (AGV) technologies. That deal expanded Adept's traditional market from repetitive processes coupled with conveyors to shuttle product within a facility, to production logistics systems, where robots navigate unstructured environments, such as hospitals and factories with variable tasks.
