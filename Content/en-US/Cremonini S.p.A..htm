   Cremonini is one of Italy's leading food producers and food service operators. The company supplies Europe, the Middle East, and Russia with fresh, frozen, and processed beef through Inalca, Salumi d'Emila, and Montana Alimentari. Distribution unit MARR is a foodservice supplier offering a full line of food and non-food items to restaurant and hospitality operators. Cremonini owns the vending machine firm Time Vending and provides food services for travelers at airports and on trains through Chef Express. It also operates a chain of Roadhouse Grill steakhouses in Italy.  The Cremonini family owns a controlling interest in the company.

  <p>
   A farmer's son, Luigi Cremonini tried pig farming after leaving college. But disease wiped out his stock, so Cremonini switched occupations, opening a small slaughterhouse in 1963. Business grew beyond butchering, and in 1966 he formed Inalca to process and market beef. The company began producing delicatessen meats with the formation of Corta Buona S.p.A. in 1976. While meats gave the company muscle, it expanded into food service distribution in 1979 through hotel and restaurant supplier MARR.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next stop for Cremonini was to add commercial catering company Agape in 1982. In 1988 it invested in Islandia's home delivery of Quinta Stagione frozen foods, and in 1991 became the major shareholder of the firm.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1994 Luigi Cremonini was Italy's hamburger king and his Burghy fast food chain had spread nationwide. At the other end of the dining spectrum that year Burghy's burgers proved irresistible to
   <company id="10974">
    McDonald's
   </company>
   , which in 1996 bought the 80-unit chain in an effort to break into Italy's difficult market. Cremonini closed the sale with the agreement to be sole supplier of beef to McDonald's in Italy for five years, and a chance at other supply contracts abroad. Around the same time, the company sold off its other fast food chain, Italy &amp; Italy, and other non-core businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Public concern over "la mucca pazza" (mad cow disease or BSE) caused beef consumption to drop sharply in 1996, and Inalca saw red ink for the first time in 1997. In preparation to go public, Cremonini's Castelvetro Finanziaria (Cafin) holding company changed its name in 1998 to the better-recognized Cremonini S.p.A.

  <p>
   Building on its experience with on-board food services for Italy's trains, in 2000 the company's catering business received the contract to provide catering on trains running between the UK and France.
  </p>
  <p>
   Italy's first BSE-infected cow was discovered in early 2001 at a Cremonini processing plant - sending the company and its customers scrambling to reassure consumers. Luigi Cremonini's son Vincenzo was named CEO of the company in later that year, replacing Roberto Canonico who had held the position for less than six months. As part of a joint venture with US-based

    Roadhouse Grill

   , in late 2001 Cremonini's restaurant group opened the first Roadhouse Grill American-style steakhouse in Italy.
  </p>
  <p>
   High-speed train operator Thalys in early 2002 awarded Cremonini the catering contract for its trains serving Belgium. That same year Cremonini sold its spice and seasoning business to Ireland's

   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2003 Cremonini partnered with food service giant
   <company id="93494">
    Compass Group
   </company>
   to form 50-50 joint venture Moto SpA to bid on licenses for Italian roadside restaurants. (The company acquired Compass' 50% stake in 2006.) Cremonini spun off a minority stake of its MARR foodservice distribution unit to the public in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   Luigi Cremonini took the company private in 2008, acquiring the 40% of the business he didn't already own for about $270 million.
