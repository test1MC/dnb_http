   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   is its largest customer). It operates 31 manufacturing plants and about 30 distribution centers throughout the US; it also has sales offices in the UK. Central Garden &amp; Pet's proprietary brand lines include AMDRO fire ant bait, Four Paws animal products, Kaytee bird seed, Nylabone dog chews, Norcal pottery, Pennington grass seed and bird seed products, and TFH pet books. Chairman William Brown controls the company.

It engages in the manufacturing, purchase, sale and delivery of pet supplies, books and food.
  </p>
  <p>

   Central Garden &amp; Pet relies heavily on just a few national retailer chains for much of its sales. In 2015 the company's largest customer,
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart,
   </company>
   accounted for 16% of total net sales, and about 30% of sales for the Garden segment.
   <company id="11470">
    The Home Depot
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10920">
    Lowe's
   </company>
   accounted for 7% and 8% of annual sales, respectively.
   <company id="16273">
    PetSmart
   </company>
   accounted for 8% of the Pet segment's net sales.
   <company id="137426">
    PETCO
   </company>
   is also a big customer.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company relies on a domestic sales network to promote its proprietary brands to some 6,000 independent specialty stores. Central Garden &amp; Pet also operates a sales and logistic facility in the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company incurred $25 million in advertising expenses.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Central Garden &amp; Pet's net revenue rose by 3% to $1.65 billion in 2015 due to an increase in Pet segment sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Pet segment increased due to higher branded product sales (including products produced under Central brand names and products under third-party brands and sales of other manufacturers' products).
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2015, the company's net income increased by 263% to $31.97 million, mainly due to higher net revenue and a drop in interest expense. Lower interest expense due to lower average debt outstanding also helped boost net income.
  </p>
  <p>
   Central Garden &amp; Pet's operating cash inflow decreased by 31% to $87.45 million due to a change in working capital as a result of changes in accounts receivable.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company focuses on building leading brand names by introducing innovative products and packaging, extending existing product lines and entering new product categories. It also continues to make selected strategic acquisitions of companies that complement existing brands and product offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   To boost sales and profits, Central Garden &amp; Pet is in the midst of a transformation from a portfolio of separately managed businesses into a unified structure, more akin to those of multibrand packaged goods companies. Actions taken to improve the pet business included expense reductions, selective price increases, organizational changes to improve cross-functional communication, and closer collaboration with its retail customers, among other initiatives. Similar actions are being taken to improve the performance of Central Garden &amp; Pet's garden business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2014, Central Garden &amp; Pet rebuffed a takeover offer by the Harbinger Group to acquire the company's Pet segment for $750 million.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 the company acquired the pet bedding business and certain other assets of National Consumers Outdoors Corp., formerly known as Dallas Manufacturing Company, for $61 million. The acquisition complements Central Garden &amp; Pet's broad portfolio of pet products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Central Garden &amp; Pet acquired certain assets of Envincio LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SantoLubes LLC. The assets acquired include established brands, EPA registration assets, inventory, and trade receivables. This acquisition enables the acquiring company to be a key supplier and product innovator in the growing natural insecticides product market, often characterized as EPA-exempt products, as well as expanding its offerings in traditional pesticides.

  <p>
   Central Garden &amp; Pet Company's roots go back to 1955, when it was founded as a small California distributor of lawn and garden supplies. After nearly three decades of unremarkable growth, it was purchased in 1980 by William Brown, a former VP of finance at camera maker
   <company id="58711">
    Vivitar
   </company>
   . The company acquired small distributors but let them operate autonomously. By 1987 Central had sales of $25 million with distribution in California.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's first major acquisition was the result of a restructuring of forestry giant
   <company id="11630">
    Weyerhaeuser
   </company>
   , which had diversified into insurance, home building, and diapers, among other products, but was selling noncore divisions to focus solely on timber. It sold Weyerhaeuser Garden Supply to Central in 1990 for $32 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Overnight, Central became a national powerhouse with 25 distribution centers serving 38 states. In 1991 sales reached $280 million, of which acquired operations accounted for nearly 70%. The purchase also gave Central 10 high-volume retail customers -- including
   <company id="17060">
    Costco
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10830">
    Kmart
   </company>
   , and Wal-Mart -- which accounted for half of its business. That year the company also acquired a pet distributor, its first move into pet supplies.
  </p>
  <p>
   To pay down debt associated with the Weyerhaeuser acquisition, the company (then officially known as Central Garden &amp; Pet Company) went public in 1993 (a 1992 IPO was withdrawn when a warehouse fire damaged inventory). With the capital for growth, Central continued to acquire other distributors (from early 1993 to early 1994, it acquired six distributors with about $70 million in sales).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 the company's largest supplier, Solaris (then a unit of
   <company id="100932">
    Monsanto
   </company>
   and maker of Ortho and Roundup products), decided to bypass Central as its distributor and sell products directly. Solaris products accounted for nearly 40% of the company's sales, and revenues dipped in 1995. However, that year Solaris decided that self-distribution was too difficult and made Central its exclusive distributor. Total sales increased about 65% in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   Broadening its pet supply distribution network, in 1996 Central paid $33 million for Kenlin Pet Supply, the East Coast's largest pet distributor, and Longhorn Pet Supply in Texas. The following year the company bought Four Paws Products and Sandoz Agro.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Central paid $132 million for TFH Publications, one of the nation's largest producers of pet books and maker of Nylabone dog snacks, and Kaytee Products, a maker of bird seed. It added Pennington Seed, a maker of grass and bird seed, in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company broadened its scope in 1999 with the purchase of Norcal Pottery Products. It also tried to buy Solaris, but that year Monsanto sold its Solaris unit to grass firm The Scotts Company (now
   <company id="13555">
    Scotts Miracle-Gro
   </company>
   ). In a familiar refrain for Central, Scotts then decided to shift partially toward self-distribution, costing Central between $200 million and $250 million in annual sales; Scotts would completely sever distribution ties with Central the following year, leading to countering lawsuits.
  </p>
  <p>
   Central said in early 2000 it would spin off its lawn and garden distribution business to shareholders, but the company abandoned the plan less than a year later. In March 2000 the company acquired AMDRO fire ant killer and IMAGE, a weed herbicide, from American Home Products (now
   <company id="10093">
    Wyeth
   </company>
   ) for $28 million. Later that year Central purchased All-Glass Aquarium Company, a manufacturer and marketer of aquariums and related products.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a result of no longer being the distributor of Scotts products, Central closed 13 of its distribution centers in 2001. Central announced the next year that it would restate its financial results for 1998 through 2002. The company said the changes would improve fiscal 2001 net results by $2 million, but decrease net results by $1.7 million in 2000, $0.3 million in 1999, and $0.1 million in 1998. Also that year
   <company id="40297">
    Mars
   </company>
   ' Kal Kan Division and
   <company id="59140">
    Arch Chemicals
   </company>
   stopped using Central as a distributor.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Central acquired a 49% stake in E. M. Matson, a lawn and garden manufacturer in the western US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 the company completed a menagerie's worth of acquisitions: Kent Marine, an aquarium supplements maker; New England Pottery, which sells decorative pottery and Christmas items (from
   <company id="113440">
    Heritage Partners
   </company>
   ); Lawrence plc's pet products division, Interpet; KRB Seed, which does business as Budd Seed (Rebel and Palmer's Pride grass-seed brands); and Energy Savers Unlimited, which distributes aquarium lighting systems and related environmental controls and conditioners.
  </p>
  <p>
   It continued along the same path throughout the rest of the decade, acquiring Gulfstream Home &amp; Garden (garden products), Pets International (small animal and specialty pet supplies),
   <company id="54098">
    Farnam Companies
   </company>
   (animal health products), and the assets of family-owned pet food maker
   <company id="138748">
    Breeder's Choice
   </company>
   . The firm also increased its stakes in insect control products supplier Tech Pac (from 20% to 80%) and garden controls manufacturer Matson (from 50% to full ownership).
