   MOCON makes precision instruments that help you look before you leak. Its products include permeation and packaging instruments that measure the rate at which oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor penetrate packaging. The company also makes materials analyzers that measure the thickness of coatings and thin films. Such products are used by packagers in the food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, and chemical industries, and by paper, plastics, and coatings manufacturers. MOCON also makes pharmaceutical capsule and tablet weighing and sorting devices, automatic sample preparation systems, and offers related consulting and development services. More than half of sales come from outside the US.

   MOCON operates through three divisions: package testing products, permeation products, and industrial analyzers. Package testing products (45% of sales) consist of headspace analyzers, leak detection equipment, and gas mixers sold under the brands PAC CHECK, CheckMate, CheckPoint, LeakMatic, MAP Mix, and MAP Check 3.
  </p>
  <p>
   Permeation products (40% of sales) measure the rate at which gases and vapors transmit through materials. Its product portfolio consists of the AQUATRAN, OX-TRAN, PERMATRAN-W, and PERMATRAN-C series.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, industrial analyzers (15% of sales) consist of gas chromatograph and total hydrocarbon analyzers sold under the brands BEVALERT, PETROALERT, and piD-TECH,as well as its GreenLight line of microbial detection products.

  <p>
   MOCON has experienced steady growth for the past four years, and overall sales increased 14% in 2013 to $57 million after adding in the sales of its 2012 acquisition of Dansensor. Profits grew 70% to $3.4 million thanks to the revenue boost and a slight decrease in income tax. Its primary source of funds is cash flow from operating activities, and in 2013 the company had $3.6 million, a nice boost from the $500,000 it had in 2012.

  <p>
   The company also uses select acquisitions to drive growth. In 2012 MOCON paid $20 million for Denmark-based PBI-Dansensor, a maker of instruments used in Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP), which is used to extend the shelf life of foods, pharmaceuticals, and other perishable products. The purchase expanded MOCON's presence in Europe and in the growing MAP market with products that complement its package testing offerings. Dansensor makes gas mixers, headspace analyzers, and leak detection equipment, and most of its sales come from outside the US.
