   Ambulance chasers are no bother for Collins Industries. The company is a US maker of ambulances and specialty vehicles, such as small school buses, shuttle and midsized vans, and terminal trucks (used to move trailers and containers in warehouses). Collins also makes commercial bus chassis, industrial sweepers, and road construction equipment. It has a distribution network of about 70 dealers in the US and Canada. Collins markets its products under brand names, including Capacity, Collins Bus, Wheeled Coach, and World Trans. It is part of REV Group (formerly Allied Specialty Vehicles, or ASV), the largest maker of ambulances in North America, which is owned by private-equity firm American Industrial Partners.

  <p>
   Don Collins formed Collins Industries in 1971. Its first product was a small school bus designed to carry 16 to 20 passengers. The business soon began making ambulances as well. The company went public in 1983, and the next year it expanded into terminal trucks by purchasing Capacity of Texas.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1990s brought trouble for the company. Sales stagnated, and in 1992 Collins overstated profits. The resulting SEC investigation and class-action lawsuit cost the company about $2.2 million. Collins' CFO, who had been aware of the overstatement, resigned. Legal problems and weak product demand contributed to losses, and the bad news stirred talk that Collins was a takeover target. But strong sales and lower costs in fiscal 1996 put Collins back on firmer ground.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unhappy with the sales generated by its wheelchair lift products unit, Collins sold the line in 1997 to MascoTech's Braun Engineering subsidiary for $1.2 million. In 1998 Collins gained Ohio operations when it bought Mid Bus, its largest competitor in the market for small school buses. Lower sales of ambulances and terminal trucks caused a dip in fiscal 1998 sales. To promote exports, the company formed Collins International that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales increased 25% in 1999 as customers replaced vans with small school buses to better meet safety standards. Terminal truck and ambulance sales began to recover in early 2000. Later that year Collins bought assets of Waldon Inc. (Waldon and Lay-Mor road construction equipment and industrial rental sweepers, Oklahoma).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 investment firm Venture Securities Corp. took a 10.9% stake in the company. In early 2003 Collins was awarded a $ 7.0 million contract to provide school buses for the state of New Jersey.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's COO and its CFO retired abruptly in March 2005, and president and CEO Donald Collins (son of the founder) took both jobs on an interim basis. Both positions were filled by May 2005, however.
  </p>
  <p>
   In October 2006 Collins Industries was acquired by American Industrial Partners (AIP) and
   <company id="14612">
    Steel Partners Holdings
   </company>
   , two investment firms, for around $110 million.
   <company id="10241">
    BNS
   </company>
   , largely owned by Steel Partners, received an 80% controlling stake in Collins.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following its acquisition, Collins embarked on a series of strategic moves, including the sale of its Waldon product line, closure of a plant in Ohio, and purchase of selected assets of Les Entreprises Michel Corbeil Inc. (which boosted Collins' bus division product line). BNS in early 2010 divested its stake in Collins for approximately $64.9 million to AIP.
