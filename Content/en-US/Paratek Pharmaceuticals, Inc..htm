   Paratek Pharmaceuticals is determined to fight the problem of antibiotic-resistant infections. A clinical-stage biopharmaceutical firm, Paratek focuses on developing tetracycline-based therapeutics, which have the potential to be an innovative class of antibiotics. Its two primary product candidates are omadacycline for the treatment of skin infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and sarecycline for the treatment of acne. Paratek's first commercial product, Intermezzo, is a quick-acting, low-dosage medication for treating insomnia that occurs in the middle of the night. However, Intermezzo (approved in 2011) never cracked the insomnia market. Paratek contracts with third parties for manufacturing and sales.

  <p>
   Paratek has a collaboration agreement with
   <company id="12311">
    Allergan
   </company>
   , which holds the US rights to develop and commercialize sarecycline for the treatment of acne and rosacea.

   Paratek has yet to generate any income from product sales; any revenue it has made over the years has come from license fees, milestone payments, research and development reimbursements, and grants from the government of other organizations. In fiscal 2015, Paratek had no revenue, versus the $4.3 million revenue it made (itself largely composed of a $4 million milestone payment from
   <company id="12311">
    Allergan
   </company>
   ) in 2014. However, it continued to invest in research and development, as well as covering operating expenses, which led to a 2015 net loss of $70.9 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the company continues to pour money into R&amp;D, overall losses have kept climbing. By the end of 2015, Paratek has an accumulated deficit of $268.7 million. It expects to incur significant operating losses for the near future.

   Paratek is working to develop new therapies to treat antibiotic-resistant bugs, which is an area of growing concern among health watchdogs. It expects its candidate omadacycline, if approved, will be used in emergency rooms and other care settings. That drug has the potential to be a blockbuster, especially if it becomes the antibiotic of choice, as Paratek hopes it does. Additionally, the company holds patent rights through 2028, a distinct competitive advantage.
  </p>
  <p>
   Like any drug company, Paratek has to keep feeding the pipeline through R&amp;D and licensing. In 2015, its R&amp;D spending totaled $50.8 million, up from $5 million in 2014.

  <p>
   The company merged with publicly held
   <company id="120307">
    Novacea
   </company>
   in 2009. The company had changed its name from TransOral Pharmaceuticals in mid-2007. It then agreed to merge with Novacea a year later when Novacea's lead oncology drug candidate, Asentar, failed in clinical trials. After the deal closed in early 2009, former Transcept stockholders held 60% of the combined entity. Following the merger, the publicly traded company aimed to conduct itself as a late-state drug development company with an emphasis on psychiatric and sleep medicine.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the troubled Transcept combined with Paratek Pharmaceuticals, an antibiotics developer, in a reverse merger.
