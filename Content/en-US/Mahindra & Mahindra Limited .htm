  </p>
  <p>
   Net income declined by 12% due to decreased sales, increased employee benefits expense and other costs.

  <p>
   Company Background
  </p>
  <p>
   M&amp;M got its start in 1945 assembling jeeps from the US. Its Automotive sector, which is its oldest unit, was founded in 1954.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the company launched Mahindra Australia and Mahindra China Tractor, which is a joint venture with Jiangling Motor. Also in China, M&amp;M allied with Jiansu Yueda Yancheng Tractor Manufacturing in 2009. The company announced in early 2011 that it is is spending $6 million to buy a 38% share in EPC Industrie, a micro-irrigation company, with plans to acquire an additional 20% stake later in the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the meantime, M&amp;M is eying a future in vehicles powered by alternative fuel sources, such as compressed natural gas (CNG) and electricity, as well as a hydrogen-power and biodiesel. In 2010 M&amp;M purchased a controlling stake in Indian electric car maker REVA (renamed Mahindra REVA). M&amp;M will bring product development, deep pockets, and management know-how, along with 450 million rupees ($10 million); it will receive ready-made electric engines for its entire product line.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to expand its SUV manufacturing worldwide, the company has moved into Korea, too. In 2011 it completed its KRW522.5 billion ($473.5 million) acquisition of a controlling stake (about 70%) in bankrupt Ssangyong Motor Co. The acquisition of the Korean car maker paves the way for M&amp;M to establish a significant presence in southeast Asia, and a springboard to neighboring regions, as well as to pick up a string of technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Earlier in the year M&amp;M took a presence in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) market -- west and central Asia, as well as Africa -- by agreeing to enter into a joint venture with Arabia Holdings, a UAE-based real estate, logistics, and transportation company. M&amp;M will hold a controlling interest in the joint venture known as Ras Al Khaimah Transport Investments to manufacture and sell armored vehicles (for military and commercial use) in that region.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another important joint venture includes M&amp;M's partnership with
   <company id="41191">
    Renault
   </company>
   , which dates back to 2005. The combined business named Mahindra Renault Private Limited made an Indian model of Renault's Logan sedan, but sales were disappointing; in early 2010 M&amp;M agreed to buy out Renault's 49% stake in the venture. Renault continues to supply engines and transmissions for the Logan to M&amp;M, which plans to reengineer the model and source parts locally.
  </p>
  <p>
   M&amp;M is also growing more active in aircraft and aerospace component manufacturing. Through subsidiary Mahindra Aerospace, M&amp;M acquired a stake of about 75% in Australia-based parts supplier Aerostaff Australia and aircraft maker Gippsland Aeronautics. The deal opens the door to bidding on defense contracts in India through tie-ups with
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40566">
    Airbus
   </company>
   , among other foreign contractors, which allows M&amp;M to source from local businesses. M&amp;M also agreed to form a joint venture with
   <company id="109919">
    BAE Systems
   </company>
   for defense land products (combat vehicles and artillery products) in late 2009.
  </p>
  <p>
   And to support all of its growth and expansion, M&amp;M formed a joint venture in early 2011 with
   <company id="13494">
    Cisco Systems
   </company>
   to create a platform to provide cloud computing services, which is described as an on-demand network serving a shared pool of computing resources. Through cloud computing, M&amp;M in essence will be changing the way it does business, focusing on the Internet to provide a range of services to its customers, including virtual dealerships.
