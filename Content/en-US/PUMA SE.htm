   PUMA is one cat that keeps changing its stripes. The company, which designs and makes footwear, apparel, and accessories sold under the PUMA, Tretorn, and Cobra Golf labels, was formed when German brothers Rudi and Adi Dassler feuded and split their family firm into

   </company>
   and PUMA. While shoes are PUMA's heritage, apparel accounts for a growing portion of sales. It has been expanding its athletic apparel styles to include men's golf, sailing, motorsports, and denim items. PUMA also operates its own retail stores and controls product distribution in many countries. French luxury-goods giant

  <p>
   German brothers Adolph and Rudolph Dassler (Adi and Rudi) began business together in Herzogenaurach as Gebr√ºder Dassler Schuhfabrik ("Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory") in 1924. The company distinguished itself by tailoring specific shoes to different sports. Its first big success came in 1936 when American Jesse Owens, donning Dassler shoes, ran into the record books at the Olympic Games.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Dasslers prospered until the Nazis took over the factory to make soldiers' boots. Late in WWII, when American troops occupied the area, Adi befriended them and even made shoes for an American soldier who would compete in the 1946 Olympics. Meanwhile, Rudi was a soldier and eventually wound up in an American prison camp. After WWII the brothers again scrounged for material for their shoes and even paid employees with things like firewood and yarn.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rudi and Adi parted ways in 1948 over war-related politics. One story says Rudi believed that Adi failed to use his Allied contacts to free him from the prison camp. The brothers agreed that neither would use the Dassler name on their products. Adi remained in the factory as adidas, and Rudi opened shop across the river as PUMA Schuhfabrik Rudolph Dassler.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1948 members of Germany's team won the first post-WWII international soccer match wearing PUMA's Atom shoes. The company became PUMA-Sportschuhfabriken Rudolf Dassler KG in 1959 when Rudi's wife and two sons, Armin and Gerd, joined the team.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1974 Rudi died and Armin took over the company. The new regime continued the innovations, introducing shoe technologies and new products during the jogging boom of the 1970s. The period lifted PUMA's fortunes, and by 1977 it was selling its shoes in nearly 150 countries, turning out 40,000 pairs of shoes from plants in seven countries and raking in $100 million a year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The mid-1980s brought the company more publicity as first Martina Navratilova and then Boris Becker won Wimbledon wearing PUMA shoes. In 1986 the company went public on the Munich and Frankfurt exchanges, raising DM86.7 million ($41 million). Before PUMA went public, Armin stepped down as head of the company (citing ill health); he retained 70% of the voting shares.
  </p>
  <p>
   PUMA faded to the back of the pack in the mid-1980s. Though it did well in Europe, it missed important trends in the fashion-conscious US, a key sports market. For fiscal 1986 PUMA lost $21.6 million and blamed the US market, where it competed with giants Reebok and NIKE.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jochen Zeitz became CEO in 1993 and began a reorganization. After a series of ownership changes, the company landed in the hands of Swiss company Proventus in 1995. After PUMA turned a profit, paying its first dividend since going public, Proventus sold all but a 25% stake to the public in 1996. The same year the company purchased its North American licensee and committed to growth in the US. In 1997 US film production company Monarchy Enterprises purchased Proventus' 25% of PUMA.
  </p>
  <p>
   PUMA raised its visibility in 1998 by signing tennis phenom Serena Williams and buying 25% of sportswear firm LogoAthletic. PUMA accomplished part of its US comeback in 1999 when, with LogoAthletic, it became an official supplier of the NFL and NBA. PUMA also bought back its UK licensing from sporting goods manufacturer Dunlop Slazenger and opened a store, its first, in California. In 2000 the company teamed up with Porsche and SPARCO to release a shoe for racecar drivers. PUMA's licensing deal with the NFL and NBA ended in 2001. Reebok later bought the assets of bankrupt LogoAthletic and landed the exclusive licenses to outfit the NBA and NFL players. The company sponsored four teams in the 2002 World Cup soccer series, a major marketing opportunity in the eyes of company officials.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 film production company Monarchy Enterprises, which held approximately 39% ownership of PUMA by then, sold off all of its stake. In 2005 Gunter and Daniela Herz (who made their fortune through the
   <company id="93460">
    TCHIBO
   </company>
   coffee group, now maxingvest) raised their stake in PUMA to a blocking minority of 25%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In October 2006 the company opened a 5,300-sq.-ft. store in Manhattan to serve as the model for all the company's future stores worldwide. In late 2007 PUMA extended the contract of chairman and CEO Zeitz through 2012. It also appointed Melody Harris-Jensbach, a management board member since mid-2007, as deputy CEO effective January 2008. Also in early 2008 Puma appointed designer Hussein Chalayan as its creative director, while acquiring a majority stake in Chalayan's fashion brand. PUMA's licensing agreement with Schiesser Lifestyle expired at the end of 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2010 PUMA sold its stake in the Hussein Chalayan fashion brand to its partner Chalayan LLP. As a result, the Hussein Chalayan brand is now managed independently from PUMA. In April the company completed the acquisition of the Cobra golf brand from Acushnet, owned by Fortune Brands. The sale included the Cobra Golf brand, its inventory, intellectual property, and endorsement contracts.
  </p>
  <p>
   PUMA became a European Corporation -- PUMA SE -- in 2011.
