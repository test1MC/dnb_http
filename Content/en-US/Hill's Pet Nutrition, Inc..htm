   Hill's Pet Nutrition is barking up the right tree as one of the top producers of premium pet food worldwide. The company's Science Diet and Ideal Balance pet foods are available through pet supply stores and veterinary professionals while its Prescription Diet therapeutic products are sold only through veterinarians. Its cat and dog foods are produced and marketed in varieties that cater to a pet's dietary requirements, medical condition, and age. Hill's also makes animal treats. It sells its products in the US, Japan, and more than 90 other countries worldwide. This subsidiary of
   <company id="10363">
    Colgate-Palmolive
   </company>
   was founded in 1948, after a veterinarian cooked up a special food to treat a guide dog's kidney problems.

The company's operations extend nationwide from Kentucky to Kansas, and to Indiana. Its primary research center is located in Topeka, Kansas. Internationally, the pet food maker boasts a facility in the Czech Republic.

   The Hill's business represents one of two product segments operated by
   <company id="10363">
    Colgate-Palmolive
   </company>
   . (Oral, Personal and Home Care is Colgate-Palmolive's other segment.) The company generates about 13% of its parent's total sales.

   Hill's sells its products through retailers, online stores, and veterinarian offices. Online retailers, such as amazonpets,

    PetSmart

   The dog and cat food company rang up 13% of Colgate-Palmolive's $17 billion in sales in 2012. Net sales for Hill's Pet Nutrition (HPN) decreased 0.5% in 2012, to $2.16 billion, as a volume decline of 2.5% and negative foreign exchange of 2% were partially offset by net selling price increases of 4%. Organic sales in HPN increased 1.5% in 2012. Volume declines in the US, Japan, and Europe were partially offset by volume gains in Australia, Brazil, and South America. HPN's operating profit increased 5% over the same period, to $589 million, or 27% of net sales.

   New products are a key driver of the company's sales. To that end, in July 2013 Hill's launched five new Science Diet foods, and eight new treats for cats and dogs featuring natural ingredients. In February of 2013, the company introduced Hill's Ideal Balance Natural brand of food for dogs and cats. The new Hill's Ideal Balance brand was the company's first new brand since the launch of Science Diet in 1968. A partnership that Hill's inked in 2010 has also given the company yet another way to reach new customers. An alliance with VetCentric extended the reach of its namesake pet foods to veterinarians and pet owners with help from the nation's largest practice-to-home delivery company. VetCentric specializes in the delivery of prescription medications, as well as veterinary therapeutic and wellness foods.

   Volume declines in developed markets, such as the US and Europe, are being somewhat offset by gains in newer markets, including Brazil. As part of a business realignment and other cost-saving measures, Hill's closed its facility in Los Angeles, California in 2011.
