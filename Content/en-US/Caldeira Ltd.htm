   When its customers take a load off and sit down, Caldeira wants to make sure that they are comfortable. The company is a designer and manufacturer primarily of cushions and curtains, operating through four chief divisions: Caldeira UK, Caldeira China (known in China as Hao Sheng Textiles), Caldeira USA, and Caldeira Retail (its chain of some 15 home textile stores in the UK doing business as The Fabric Warehouse). The company stocks roll fabrics and supplies a large selection of leading brand names. Caldeira's divisions also sell cushion covers, seat pads, throws, bed sets, and window fashions.
