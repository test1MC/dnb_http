   In 2015 Toyota entered into a business alliance with Mazda for the production of Toyota brand light vehicles sale mainly in North America at Mazda's plant in Mexico.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it began the production of the RX450h hybrid model at its Cambridge plant in Canada. The company has also planned to commence production of the Lexus ES350 at its Kentucky plant, for sale in the North America market by the end of 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Toyota is relocating its North American headquarters for manufacturing, sales and marketing, financial services and other functions to the city of Plano in northern Dallas, Texas, ollowing the completion of the construction of the new facilities in late 2016 or early 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is focused on assuming a leadership position in hybrid technology. It 2013 it announced that by the end of 2015 it planned to introduce more than a dozen new or redesigned hybrid vehicles worldwide, including the next-generation Prius. Hybrid cars currently make up more than 15% of Toyota's global sales mix.

  <p>
   With most of its dealerships located in major metropolitan markets, TMS has begun a new strategy of establishing dealerships located in rural areas. Toyota's full-sized Tundra trucks appeal to the non-urban market and have opened up that sector, which was previously difficult to penetrate.

  <p>
   In the US, the Camry has been the top-selling car in the midsize sedan market (the largest segment in the industry) for more than 10 straight years. Amid intense competitive pressure from the

   Accord and

   Fusion, among others, TMS offered discounts in 2013 to keep the Camry at the top of that list.
