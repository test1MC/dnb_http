  <p>
   The fully integrated aluminum company has operations across all the major aspects of the aluminum value chain, from bauxite and alumina mining, through aluminum smelting and production to sales and marketing. It is a global energy player, purchasing and consuming substantial quantities of energy for its smelters, rolling mills and alumina refinery operations. Norsk Hydro is also the largest publicly owned power producer in Norway stakes in 24 hydroelectric power plants (2,000 MW of installed capacity in 2014)
  </p>
  <p>
   Norsk Hydro has six operating segments: Bauxite &amp; Alumina, Primary Metal, Metal Markets, Rolled Products, Energy, and Other.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bauxite and Alumina includes bauxite mining activities comprised of the Paragominas mine and a 5% in Mineracao Rio de Norte (both located in Brazil), as well as 92% of Brazilian alumina refinery, Alunorte. It also has a 81% interest in the joint venture partnership Companhia de Alumina do Param which is building a new alumina refinery close to Alunorte.
  </p>
  <p>
   Primary Metal consists of aluminum production, remelting and casting activities at company smelters in Norway, and at partly owned companies in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Qatar, and Slovakia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Metal Markets includes all sales and distribution activities relating to products from their primary metal plants and operational responsibility for their stand-alone remelters. It also includes metal sourcing and trading activities, which provides operational risk management through LME hedging activities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rolled Products consists of five European rolling mills include the company's 50% interest in the AluNorf rolling mill in Germany (and the Rheinwerk primary aluminum smelter in Neuss, Germany).
  </p>
  <p>
   Energy manages Hydro Norsk's captive hydropower production, and external power sourcing arrangements to the aluminum business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other includes the company's 50% share in Sapa, a global leader in extruded aluminium production with significant operations in Europe, North America, South America and Asia.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2014 Norsk Hydro's revenues increased by 20% (in local currency) compared to 2013 due to improved performances across all segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bauxite and alumina production sales were higher mainly due to production stability following operational setbacks at Alunorte in the previous year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income amounted to NOK 1,228 million in 2014, compared with a net loss of NOK 839 million in 2013. This increase was mainly due to higher revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 cash from operating activities was NOK 5.96 billion, compared to NOK 5.2 billion in 2013.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company plans to secure competitive long term power sourcing for its aluminum operations including the potential pilot plant at Karmøy, building small hydropower plants, and continuing efficiency improvements in existing plants. It is also looking strengthen its local presence in Brazil to secure competitive energy supplies for its alumina refining and aluminum smelting operations and exploit commercial opportunities in the Brazilian power market. In this regard, Norsk Hydro is looking to lift alumina production in Alunorte towards name-plate capacity together with achieving a NOK 1 billion improvement target by the end of 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also aiming to become the world's first metal and mining company to become carbon neutral by 2020, improving fuel efficiency through lighter vehicles, enable zero-energy buildings and develop light-weight, resource-efficient packaging that preserves food and demands less energy for transport.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is also restructuring to improve business operations. In 2014 Norsk Hydro restructured Sapa and spent NOK 277 million towards Research and development related to preparation for the Karmøy Technology Pilot.

   Growing its asset base, in 2014 Norsk Hydro acquired

   's 50% share of the Søral aluminium smelter.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Norwegian entrepreneurs Sam Eyde and Kristian Birkeland began Norsk Hydro-Elektrisk Kvaelstofaktieselskap (Norwegian Hydro-Electric Nitrogen Corp.) in 1905. The company used electricity generated from waterfalls to extract nitrogen from the air to produce fertilizer.
  </p>
  <p>
   After WWII the Norwegian government seized German holdings in Norsk Hydro and took a 48% stake in the company. It grew to be the largest chemical firm in Scandinavia. In 1965, when Norway granted licenses for offshore petroleum exploration, the company formed partnerships with foreign companies. These included Phillips Petroleum, which spurred the North Sea boom in 1969 when its drilling rig Ocean Viking struck oil in the giant Ekofisk field, and Elf Aquitaine, which oversaw the Frigg discovery in 1971. The Norwegian state increased its share of Norsk Hydro to 51% in 1972.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also branched out with hydroelectric-powered aluminum processing at its Karmoy Works (1967) and with a fish-farming subsidiary, Mowi (1969). During much of the 1970s, it focused on oil and gas development, which added to the treasury and helped finance growth, often through acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Norsk Hydro pushed into the European fertilizer market by buying Dutch company NSM in 1979; during the 1980s it acquired interests in fertilizer operations in France, Sweden, and the UK. In petrochemicals it expanded by buying two British PVC makers. Norsk Hydro-controlled Hydro Aluminum merged with ASV, another Norwegian aluminum company, in 1986, and the company consolidated its aluminum holdings two years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hydro served as operator in the Oseberg field, which began production in 1988 and grew rapidly to become a major source of oil and gas. In 1990 it bought 330 Danish gasoline stations from UNO-X; in 1992 it purchased Mobil Oil's Norwegian marketing and distribution system. Two years later Norsk Hydro merged its oil and marketing operations in Norway and Denmark with Texaco's.
  </p>
  <p>
   A weak world economy and increased competition limited its revenues in 1992 and 1993. The company countered slumping sales by selling noncore subsidiaries, including pharmaceutical unit Hydro Pharma (1992) and chocolate maker Freia Marabou (1993).
  </p>
  <p>
   Norsk Hydro expanded further during the early 1990s, acquiring fertilizer plants in Germany, the UK, and the US, as well as W. R. Grace's ammonia plants in Trinidad and Tobago. The firm acquired Fisons' NPK fertilizer business in 1994. The company agreed to an asset swap with Petro-Canada in 1996, becoming a partner in oil and gas fields off the east coast of Canada. That year Norsk Hydro bought UNO-X's Swedish gas station operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Norwegian government's stake in Norsk Hydro was reduced from 51% to about 45% in 1999 when the company and state-owned Statoil made a deal to take over Saga Petroleum, Norway's leading independent oil producer, to keep it out of foreign hands.
  </p>
  <p>
   In light of major losses in 1999 by Hydro Agri, the company made plans in 2000 to close several European nitrogen fertilizer operations. However, it agreed to modernize and expand its Hydro Aluminum Sunndal facility, to make it the largest aluminum plant in Europe. That year the company also sold Saga UK (North Sea assets) to Conoco, and its fish-farming unit to Dutch company Nutreco.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company acquired a stake in Soquimich, an industrial minerals company in Chile, and majority control of Slovakian aluminum producer Slovalco.
  </p>
  <p>
   The new decade brought with it a new focus; the company began to make aluminum its primary business lines. Toward that end Norsk Hydro bought VAW Aluminum from
   <company id="43005">
    E.On AG
   </company>
   for $2.8 billion in a deal that enabled it to expand its product base in Europe and the US, especially to key customers in the automobile industry. It then sold its flexible packaging unit to
   <company id="42408">
    Alcan
   </company>
   for about $545 million in 2003. Furthering the same goal, the company announced in 2003 and then followed through on a spinoff of its agrochemical unit the following year. The resultant company was
   <company id="132754">
    Yara International
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Norsk Hydro sold its chemicals business to
   <company id="104943">
    Ineos
   </company>
   for $900 million in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 Svein Richard Brandtzæg took over as chief executive. He had been in charge of Hydro's Aluminum Products unit previously. Eivind Reiten resigned after eight years in charge of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Norsk Hydro acquired the Brazilian bauxite mining and alumina refining units of
   <company id="95034">
    Vale SA
   </company>
   for $5.7 billion, making it a major bauxite and alumina miner.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Vale purchase gave Norsk Hydro control of the world's third-largest bauxite mine and the world's biggest alumina refinery, which have the capacity to supply the company with sufficient raw materials to operate without external suppliers for several decades. Norsk Hydro paid Vale about $1.1 billion in cash and a 22% stake in Norsk Hydro for the assets. The Norwegian government backed the deal, and reduced its stake in Norsk Hydro by about 20%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although the Vale acquisition positioned Norsk Hydro for growth, the aluminum markets have seen demand declining in 2011 and 30% of the aluminum producers losing money. Total demand growth declined to 7% in 2011 from a 19% increase in 2010. A drop in European demand has affected the market, due primarily to uncertainty over eurozone debt. A weakening economy has Chinese producers starting to cut back on production, and Hydro has stated that it would not restart its idled Sunndal smelter in Norway.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash, in 2011 Norsk Hydro divested its 21% ownership stake in Norwegian power production company SKS Produksjon AS to Salten Kraftsamband AS for $187 million. The deal did not affect Hydro's other power grid holdings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 it agreed to form an aluminum manufacturing joint venture with Orkla. The proposed joint venture, which will retain the Sapa name (currently the aluminum products division of Orkla), will be equally owned by Norsk Hydro and Orkla, and will combine their respective profiles, building systems, and tubing business to create the world's largest manufactured aluminum products provider.
