The lineup is available in more than 160 countries to restaurants, groceries, and retail chains. It offers freight, warehousing, and distribution services for fresh produce, too. The McCain family began making fries in 1957 and still owns the company.

   In addition to producing frozen food, McCain Foods' diverse activities include a produce and fertilizer business. Its transportation holdings include Day &amp; Ross (general freight services); Day &amp; Ross Dedicated Logistics (private fleet services); Fastrax Transportation (truckload services); Sameday Worldwide (courier, express and cargo services); and Sable Warehousing (storage and distribution). Its logistics operations offer a number of advantages. McCain's investment in a refrigerated warehouse in France supports an adjacent production plant and widens the door to serving the European marketplace.

   Although McCain scoops up McDonald's international business, arch rival
   <company id="40256">
    J.R. Simplot
   </company>
   supplies the majority of frozen fries in the US. McCain also contends with a slump in demand for higher-priced convenience foods driven by a tough economy that has hammered consumer purchases as well as dining out. Nonetheless, McCain is an established name brand in Canada and the frozen food aisles in the US and Europe. As fast food continues to spread into developing countries, McCain is further reducing erosion to its top line by extending its reach to South America, South Africa, the Middle East, Asia (India, China, Taiwan), and Australia. To that end, in fall 2012 the company announced plans to double the operating capacity of its potato processing plant in Harbin, China. The Harbin facility (built in 2005) is one of several potato processing plants McCain operates in the Asia-Pacific region.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also strengthens its bargaining power by purchasing potatoes and other crops from 3,200 farmers around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   Going forward, McCain is focusing on demand for healthier offerings, by cooking up products with reduced calories and sodium content, no trans fats, little saturated fat, and alternate "flavor enhancers." It has changed the recipes of 70 products to use fewer additives and preservatives.

  <p>
   Using $100,000 from an inheritance, in 1956 brothers Harrison and Wallace McCain set up a frozen french fry plant in Florenceville, New Brunswick. The fast-food industry was in its infancy, but their goal was to reach across central Canada. By the late 1960s the company had established plants in the UK and Australia and had begun exporting fries to the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1970s McCain Foods grew on a steady diet of acquisitions and new plant construction. New products included value-added, prepared frozen foods (1971); new territories included deeper expansion into Europe and the US. Noting a trend, the company opened its first frozen pizza plants (Canada, Australia) in 1976, followed by another in 1979 in the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   As worldwide demand for fries grew, so did McCain, along with its relationship to fast-food companies, including McDonald's overseas (J.R. Simplot had locked up the McDonald's US market). The 1980s were marked by McCain's continued interest in both value-added products and expansion in Europe. With the 1980 purchase of Sunny Orange Juice Company (Canada), McCain entered the beverage industry. Other orange juice businesses were later purchased in the US (1985) and Europe (1988). Further acquisitions took the company into other niches, including vegetable and fish processing and potato-based animal feeds. The company ended the 1980s as the largest frozen french-fry maker on the planet.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the early 1990s, as the McCain brothers neared retirement, disagreement erupted over who would succeed them. Wallace was grooming his son Michael, while Harrison preferred nephew Allison (son of their deceased brother Andrew who shared ownership, but never worked in the company). The disagreement deepened into a feud. After lengthy arbitration, in 1994 Wallace was booted from his position of co-CEO, but retained his 34% ownership and board position. For a response, in 1995 Wallace purchased ailing Maple Leaf Foods and set about to turning it around with the help of Michael and a handful of top McCain executives. Meanwhile, Howard Mann was named president and CEO of McCain in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   The steady pace of acquisitions and construction was barely affected by the familial squabblings, and in 1996 the company made its first move into South America with the purchase of a plant in Argentina. By 1997 the company was secure as McDonald's sole french-fry supplier in most of South America. That same year the company bought the frozen fry and appetizer foodservice operations of Ore-Ida. With an eye towards expansion in Eastern Europe, in 1998 the company built a french-fry plant in Poland.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2000 the company continued with its successful blend of acquisitions and construction, purchasing Imperial Juice, Canada's largest private-label orange juice maker; acquiring a vegetable processor in South Africa; and constructing a new plant in Maine. In 2001 the company acquired the production facilities and food service business of US frozen appetizer maker Anchor Food Products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 McCain acquired Belleisle Foods, a top frozen Chinese food manufacturer and some of the assets and businesses of specialty food producer Summersweet Fine Foods from

    Sepp's Gourmet Foods
   </company>
   . (Sepp's is now owned by the US's
   <company id="41956">

   </company>
   .) Also in 2003 the company announced the retirement of president and CEO Howard Mann. Mann remained with the company until his successor, Dale Morrison, was appointed.
  </p>
  <p>
   To bring french fries to the larger world, McCain built frozen potato factories in Russia and China in 2004. That same year the company purchased Manitoba French fry processor, Midwest Food Products. Co-founder and former company chairman Harrison McCain died in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expansion in 2005 included the construction on a potato-processing plant in India and investment in the company's technology facilities in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company acquired Jon-Lin Frozen Foods, a California-based foodservice appetizer maker whose brands include Chef Sensations and Grabitizers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold its ready-to-drink juice operations in 2007 to another Canadian juice maker
   <company id="111019">
    Lassonde Industries
   </company>
   for $13.5 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011, vice chairman Wallace McCain died at the age of 81.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2011 president and CEO Dale Morrison left the company to be a founding partner in a private equity firm. He was succeeded by COO Dirk Van de Put.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 McCain Foods Holland acquired CêlaVita B.V., a subsidiary of Bieze Food Group, a leading European chilled potato producer supplying the Benelux countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In February 2013, McCain's Australian subsidiary acquired a regional bakery business, Kitchens of Sara Lee, for $85 million from
