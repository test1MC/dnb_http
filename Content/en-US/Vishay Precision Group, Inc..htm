   Vishay Precision Group (VPG) likes to weigh in on important measurements, and the company takes pleasure in getting foiled. The spinoff of
   <company id="11587">
    Vishay Intertechnology
   </company>
   aggregates a series of acquisitions made by Vishay in weighing modules and systems. VPG also specializes in foil resistors (electronic components that regulate electrical current and voltage), precision sensors, strain gauges, and other precision measurement equipment employed in process control systems. The company's products are used in industrial applications including military, agricultural, aerospace, medical, and construction. European customers account for 40% of sales.

        <p>
   VPG divides its operations into foil technology products, force sensors, and weighing and controlling systems. Foil technology accounts for about 40% of revenue.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company sells it products worldwide with the US and Europe each accounting for about 40% of sales and Asia picking up the slack. VPG manufactures its gauges, sensors, and systems mostly in the US, Israel, India, China, Japan, and Costa Rica with additional facilities in Germany, Taiwan, Sweden, the UK, and France.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company uses its own sales force to target customers. OEMs, distributors, and end users each account for 39%, 22%, and 26%, respectively, of sales with electronic manufacturing companies filling in the gap.
  </p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   VPG's revenues jumped 4% from $240 million in 2013 to $251 million in 2014, its highest total in at least 10 years. The revenue growth for 2014 was fueled by an 11% spike in foil technology products and a 5% rise in force sensors. VPG also experienced surges in sales from Israel (64%), Asia (17%), the UK (10%), and the US (7%).
  </p>
        <p>
   VPG's profits, however, fell 10% from $4.29 million in 2013 to $3.85 million in 2014 due to increased selling, general, and administrative expenses due to headcount and wage increases. It also paid additional impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles expenses in 2014.
  </p>
        <p>
   In addition, the company's operating cash flow has fluctuated over the years; after decreasing in 2013, cash flow jumped by 64%, primarily due to changes in accounts receivable, inventories, and other current liabilities.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   For growth VPG focuses on acquisitions to help it be more vertically integrated by using its own foil strain gauges in the weighting and control systems it builds. It seeks to lower production costs through acquisitions and moving manufacturing to low cost countries and expects to continue that strategy.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In early 2013 VPG purchased George Kelk Corporation, a privately held Canadian weighing control systems company. It paid $50 million for geographic and product expansion.
