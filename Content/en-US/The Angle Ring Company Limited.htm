   The Angle Ring Company knows all the angles when it comes to fabricating metal. The company shapes and bends large steel and aluminum beams and tubes for use in the construction of structural frameworks. The company also has the capability to bend angle rings and segments using its large bending machines and to bend rolled steel channels, parallel flange channels, tapered flanges, and European parallel flanges.
