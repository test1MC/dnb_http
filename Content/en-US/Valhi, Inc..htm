  </p>
  <p>

  <p>
   The company's revenues fluctuated each year in the last five years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Valhi's revenues decreased by 2.4% was mainly due to the Chemicals segment's net sales decline of 5% as the result of lower titanium dioxide prices caused by competitive market pressures, changes in level of supply and demand as well as changes in raw material and other manufacturing costs. Sales volumes remained stable, as slightly higher sales in Europe were offset by lower sales in certain export markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales from other segments increased due to higher demand in component product segment, a rise in disposable volumes in waste management segment, and revenues from real estate.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income was $53.8 million in 2014 (compared to a loss of $151.8 million in 2013) due to a decrease in selling, general, and administrative costs, the absence of loss on prepayment of debt, and a benefit from income tax.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities decreased by 43% due to changes in changes in receivables, inventories, payables and accrued liabilities and higher net cash paid for income taxes.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company pursues a diversified growth strategy, buying and selling business to enhance its long term profitability.
  </p>
  <p>
   Valhi's titanium marketing strategy is aimed at working directly with customers to monitor the success of its products in their end-use applications, evaluate the need for improvements in product and process technology and identify opportunities to develop new product solutions for their customers. It also focuses its sales and marketing efforts on those geographic and end-use market segments for higher selling prices, including continuously reviewing and optimizing its customer and product portfolios.
