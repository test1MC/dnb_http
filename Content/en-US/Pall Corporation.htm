  <p>
   Pall's strategic plan calls for a focus on geographic expansion in high growth regions (Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America) and on beefing up (through acquisitions and organic growth) its position in high-growth markets such as biotechnology, diagnostics, cell therapy, vaccine production, micro and macroelectronics, next-generation aircraft, energy and water.

  <p>
   Canadian-born chemist David Pall worked on the Manhattan Project, helping develop systems to refine uranium for the first atomic bomb. In 1946 he founded Micro Metallic to develop filters for commercial applications. Pall added Abraham Krasnoff, a CPA, in 1950. The company went public in 1957 and was renamed Pall Corporation. During the 1960s it specialized in aircraft hydraulics and fuel systems for the defense industry. In 1969 Krasnoff became CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the late 1970s and during the 1980s, the company moved into the growing semiconductor and biotechnology industries. This process accelerated after the defense industry was hit by budget cuts late in the 1980s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pall researchers announced in 1995 the development of a filter that reduces the levels of HIV in blood serum to below detectable levels. In 1997 the company bought Gelman Sciences, maker of polymeric membranes and specialized medical disposable filters.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Pall acquired Germany-based Rochem, an osmosis filtration system manufacturer, and entered a technology partnership with VI Technologies (Vitex) for exclusive marketing rights to Vitex's viral and bacterial inactivation chemistry. The following year Pall signed a $6 million water-purification deal with the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority. Also in 1999 Pall announced a restructuring plan calling for job cuts and other spending reductions. The company sold its Well Technology division (filtration equipment and drilling services to oil and gas companies) to Oiltools International in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   The German Red Cross Transfusion Center awarded Pall a $6 million contract for blood filtration equipment in 2000 after the German government mandated that all transfused blood must be filtered. Highlights in 2001 included alliances with biopharmaceutical companies
   <company id="51783">
    QIAGEN N.V.
   </company>
   and Stedim SA. In early 2002 Pall completed the acquisition of the Filtration and Separations Group from
   <company id="13524">
   </company>
   US Filter (now Siemens Water Technologies) for about $360 million. In 2003 Pall purchased Whatman HemaSure, the blood filtration business of
   <company id="90484">
    Whatman plc
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Pall expanded in 2004 by buying BioSepra, a provider of chromatography technologies (used for protein purification and optimization), from
   <company id="100434">
    Ciphergen Biosystems
   </company>
   for about $32 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 it acquired GeneSystems, a French biotech company that developed an easy-to-use and cost-effective molecular diagnostics platform.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Pall bought MicroReactor Technologies, a US-based biotechnology firm specializing in miniature bioreactor equipment and disposables.
  </p>
  <p>
   Strengthening its expertise in the fluid management systems market in Latin America, in 2011 Pall acquired Engefiltro, its long-time Brazilian distribution partner. Engefiltro, primarily known for its filtration systems engineering capabilities, also has interests in the mining, oil and gas, chemical and petrochemical, power generation, food processing, and pharmaceutical industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pall continued its shopping in late 2011 by acquiring California-based ForteBio, which develops analytical systems to speed up discovery and development of biotech drugs. Pall hopes that the technology platforms added with the acquisition will help its biopharmaceutical customers in getting their products to market on time.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal year 2012, Pall reorganized its Industrial markets for greater efficiency. The Machinery and Equipment submarket and Energy and Water submarket were combined as the Process Technologies market.
  </p>
  <p>
   To pay down debt, in 2012 the company sold its blood collection, filtration, and processing product lines to Massachusetts-based Haemonetics, a global healthcare company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company formed a strategic partnership with the innovative medical device firm, CytoMedical Design Group LLC (CMDG), for exclusive global distribution rights of CMDG's PrepaCyte CB cord blood processing technology. The arrangement combines Pall's global leadership in the cord blood field with CMDG's unique product pipeline of highly differentiated cord blood processing technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year, Pall India signed an exclusive India distribution agreement with a leading biosupplier, Spinchrom Life Sciences, a division of Spinco Biotech Pvt. Ltd. Through the deal, Spinchrom became the exclusive distributor to market in India of Pall's ForteBio's BLItz system, a revolutionary platform that allows scientists to conduct label-free analyses of proteins using small sample volumes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Pall introduced PB110D PUREair Dry Barrier Filters as FAA-PMA direct-fit replacements for competitors' oil-wetted filters. The new product extends the successful PUREair portfolio of products available from Pall and DART Aerospace. PUREair Dry Barrier Filters have been specifically designed for applications using advanced synthetic dry media technology that virtually eliminates the maintenance associated with conventional oil-wetted barrier filters.
