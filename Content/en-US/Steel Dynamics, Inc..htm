   Steel Dynamics may operate mini-mills, but it produces steel on a large scale. Steel Dynamics operates electric arc furnace mini-mills, steel scrap processing and metals recycling centers, and steel fabrication facilities. The company sells to companies in the automotive, construction, and manufacturing industries, as well as to steel processors and service centers, primarily in the Midwestern and eastern US. Among its mini-mill output are beams, rails, and other products used in the construction, industrial machinery, and transportation industries. Steel Dynamics' annual steel shipping capacity is 11 million tons.

   Steel Dynamics has three reporting segments: Steel, Metals Recycling, and Steel Fabrication. Its Steel operations has six electric-arc furnace mini-mills, producing steel from steel scrap, using continuous casting, automated rolling mills, and 10 downstream steel coating lines, and Iron Dynamics (IDI). Its Flat Roll Division sheet steel products, such as hot rolled, cold rolled and coated steel products used by automakers and other industries, which is Long Products Division sells structural steel beams and pilings for the construction industry and industrial quality grade rail for the railroad industry. In 2015 the company's Steel operations accounted for 62% of net sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Metals Recycling operations (27%) consists solely of

  <p>
   In 2015 the company's net sales decreased by $1.16 billion compared to 2014 due to a drop in Metals Recycling revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Metals Recycling results were negatively impacted by excess US scrap competition, a strong US dollar tempering scrap exports, and lower domestic steel mill demand, resulting in substantial decreases in selling prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Steel Dynamics saw a net loss of $130.31 million in 2015 (compared to a net loss of $157.02 million in 2014) due to lower revenues and higher asset impairment charges.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net cash provided by the operating activities increased by 68% due to changes in inventories and accounts receivable.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Steel Dynamics is seeking to maintain and enhance one of the lowest operating cost structures in the North American steel industry, by optimizing the use of its equipment, enhancing productivity, and exploring new technologies to lower production costs. It is looking  to enter new markets in strategic geographic locations that offer attractive growth opportunities by acquiring new businesses or by entering joint ventures or alliances.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company collaborates with customers to expand its range of products, as illustrated by expansions at its Engineered Bar Products Division (high-quality smaller-diameter SBQ bars), and at its Structural and Rail Division (premium grade rails).

  <p>
   In 2016 Steel Dynamics acquired Vulcan Threaded Products for $114 million. The Birmingham, Alabama-based company is a manufacturer and supplier of threaded rod products, and also cold draws and heat treats steel bar.

   Growing its share of the rail market, in 2012 Steel Dynamics announced plans to install a heat-treating system (capable of producing up to 350,000 tons of standard strength and head hardened plain, carbon steel rails for North America's railroad industry) at its Columbia City, Indiana, Structural and Rail Division.
  </p>
  <p>
   Steel Dynamics entered a joint venture in 2011 with Spain's Lafarga Group to construct a $39 million facility which will produce copper wire rod from recycled copper.
