   In 2016 Beretta USA opened a manufacturing and engineering center in Gallatin, Tennessee. The gun maker has transferred production operations for the M9 9mm pistol to its new 156,000 sq. ft. Gallatin facility, as well as the manufacturing operations for the variety of other firearms the company makes. In addition to the construction of the new facility and campus, Beretta USA has plans to employ an additional 200 employees in North Central Tennessee.

   Focused on customer service as it works to boost sales, Beretta USA implemented a three-part initiative. It opened regional Beretta service centers in Connecticut, Missouri, and Texas to add to its existing one in California. The gun maker has also partnered with fellow arms supplier Brownell to provide spare part sales, storage, and distribution for customers nationwide. And Beretta USA enhanced the customer service functionality on its website to include order and service status, warranty registration, product schematics, owner's manuals, and other information available around the clock. The company has changed its production method to a "just-in-time" manufacturing process. The move has allowed Beretta to reduce its inventory levels and better meet customer needs during different seasons.
