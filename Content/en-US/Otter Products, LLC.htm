   Otter Products operates two subsidiaries. OtterBox makes protectors that are more for everyday use for phones, tablets, and other mobile devices. LifeProof, which the company acquired in 2013, makes cases for more extreme uses such as outdoor sports. Its LIFEACTÍV line include FRĒ, NÜÜD, and FRĒ Power cases. It also makes apparel for men and women.

  <p>
   Otter's products are distributed through retailers including Verizon, Best Buy, AT&amp;T, Walmart, Sprint, Target, T-Mobile, and Amazon.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company distributes its products in other countries through distribution partners such as

  <p>
   Otter maintains a steady pace of new products and product extensions. In one case, it returned to its roots by introducing a drybox, a watertight box that can protect a phone, a wallet, and other valuables for up to 30 minutes in 90 feet of water. The company has shifted most of its products for extreme environments such as ski slopes to its LifeProof line of products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Otter, in trying to expand beyond cases, has added charging and audio products to its lineup. They include Bluetooth earbuds and USB charging cables and a car charger.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company stepped up its marketing game, signing Peyton Manning, the retired
   <company id="46804">

   quarterback, as its spokesman. Previous spokesman, Ollie the Otter, was demoted to second-string spokesman.
