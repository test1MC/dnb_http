   Fenner is among the world's top manufacturers of heavyweight belting. The company's Engineered Conveyor Solutions (ECS) Division makes rubber ply, solid woven, and steel cord conveyor belting for mining, power generation, and industrial use, and it provides conveyor services such as maintenance, design, and installation. Advanced Engineered Products (AEP) makes polymer products that include precision drives for computer peripherals, copiers, and ATMs; seals for fluid power and oil and gas equipment; rollers for digital image processing; silicone and complex hoses for heavy duty trucks; and power transmission and motion transfer components.

   Fenner's AEP division comprises several precision polymer businesses. Fenner Precision makes polymer components for office automation equipment. Fenner Drives designs and customizes systems and products for motion transfer applications. James Dawson provides silicone and hoses for heavy equipment. Fenner Advanced Sealing Technologies (FAST) produces seals for mobile hydraulic equipment and mining and oil and gas equipment. In addition, Solesis Medical Technologies includes Secant Medical (textiles for implantable medical devices).

  <p>
   Fenner serves a wide variety of industries that includes thermal coal, metallurgical coal, mineral industries, oil and gas, construction, agriculture, medical, and transportation. The mining sector alone generates around 40% of net sales each year.

  <p>
   Fenner's revenues fell 14% from 2015 to 2016 due to decreased sales across its two divisions of Advanced Engineered Products (6%) and Engineered Conveyor Solutions (20%). In addition, operating profit fell during the year, reflecting continued difficulties in the US coal mining industry and an overall global slowdown in the oil and gas industry. (Note: growth rates may differ after conversion to the US dollar.)

  <p>
   For its business as a whole Fenner is optimistic about further growth in response to several trends. Fenner Drives, Fenner Precision, and James Dawson are positioned to meet growing demand for energy efficiency and renewable energy in response to concerns about climate change.  Solesis Medical and Secant Medical are expected to benefit from an increasingly aged demographic in the developed world and the general expansion of health care in Brazil, Russia, India, and China. FAST is poised for growth in sales from a coal-mining industry tasked with meeting growing energy demand in China and India.

  <p>
   The company is looking at the medical industry as an area ripe for growth. In 2015, Fenner Drives paid almost $30 million to acquire Charter Medical Limited from its parent company
   <company id="12118">
    Lydall
   </company>
   , a North Carolina-based manufacturer of specialty single-use assemblies and Class I and Class II medical devices. The acquisition helped Fenner to develop its medical business and enhanced the capabilities and offerings of Solesis. The acquisition is integrated under Solesis Medical Technologies, part of Fenner's AEP division.
