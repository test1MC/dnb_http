   Swatch is worth watching. The Swatch Group (formerly Société Suisse de Microélectronique &amp; d'Horlogerie) is one of the top watchmakers in the world. Its 20 some watch brands range from low-priced Swatch and Flik Flak collectibles to premium-priced Blancpain, Breguet, Harry Winston and Omega luxury pieces. Watches made by Swatch are sold at some 15,000 retailers worldwide, plus at more than 900 Swatch boutiques, more than 3,500 shop-in-shops, and some 140 kiosks. The company supplies nearly all the components for its own watches and also sells some movements to other watchmakers. Its Dress Your Body unit designs and makes jewelry for the Swatch Group brands.

  <p>
   Swatch's numerous business units are grouped into two business segments: Watches &amp; Jewelry and Electronic Systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Watches &amp; Jewelry, which brings in almost all of Swatch's revenue (97%) works in the design, production and commercialization of watches and jewelry, and Electronic Systems designs, produces and commercializes electronic components and sports timing products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Swatch also operates Swatch Group Services, which supports Swatch's companies in logistical, distribution and IT matters.
  </p>

  <p>
   Swatch is headquartered in Switzerland. Sales in Asia account for around 55% of total revenue, with China alone accounting for some 33%. Europe including Switzerland accounts for around 34%.

  <p>
   Swatch has a global distribution network, and has a retail section that develops new approaches to market, including monobrand stores and prestige multibrand watch and jewelry boutiques.

  <p>
   In 2015, revenue fell around 3% on prior year to CHF8.4 billion due to lower watch and jewelry sales and unfavorable currency effects relating to the overvalued Swiss franc. Tourism into Switzerland was volatile over the year, and was negatively impacted by factors such as currency shifts, infectious diseases in South Korea, changes in tourism regulations and local and regional unrest.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income fell around 27% to CHF1.1 billion. Lower net sales were partially offset by lower material prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities fell by CHF444 million.

  <p>
   Swatch is further diversifying its geographic base in order to balance the negative effects of exchange rate fluctuations. Its presence in developing markets like China, Brazil and the Middle East is increasing, and its presence in the US is growing as well.

  <p>
   The Swatch Group was first established when watchmakers ASUAG and SSIH were merged in 1983. ASUAG was founded in 1931 in Switzerland to make watches. By the late 1970s ASUAG had acquired some 100 family-owned companies, many of which were operating independently and inefficiently. When it merged with SSIH, ASUAG owned the Longines and Rado brands and made watch components.
  </p>
  <p>
   Watchmaker SSIH was formed in 1930 with the merger of brands Tissot and Omega (which traced its history to 1848). SSIH and other Swiss watchmakers were struggling by the late 1970s. The market was flooded with cheaper watches made in Japan and Hong Kong that used quartz technology (a technology invented -- but ignored -- by the Swiss). SSIH had licensed out its prestigious Omega brand to other manufacturers in various countries, hurting that brand's reputation.
  </p>
  <p>
   With both ASUAG and SSIH on the verge of bankruptcy, Swiss banks named Nicolas Hayek (then the CEO of consulting firm Hayek Engineering) to advise the companies on their futures. He recommended that ASUAG and SSIH merge and then mass-produce a low-cost watch and sell it globally at a set price. The two companies merged in 1983, forming SMH (Société Suisse de Microélectronique &amp; d'Horlogerie); its headquarters were ASUAG's in Biel, Switzerland.
  </p>
  <p>
   SMH had sales of about $1.1 billion with losses of some $124 million in 1983. That year it introduced the Swatch watch amid some resistance and objections that the watch would ruin the Swiss image of makers of high-quality, premium-priced watches. But Swatch watches became fashion statements and pop-culture icons in the 1980s and Hayek, who spearheaded the turnaround, became a Swiss business hero. Hayek and a group of investors bought a controlling 51% stake of SMH, and he became CEO in 1985.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 the company bought Blancpain (luxury watches) and Frederic Piguet (luxury watch components). By 1993 SMH had expanded into semiconductor chips, pagers, and telephones. The next year it formed a joint venture (19%-owned by SMH) called Micro Compact Car (MCC) with Daimler-Benz to make a battery- and gasoline-powered Swatchmobile.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because of difficulty in translating its name into other languages, the company changed its name in 1998 to The Swatch Group. That year it also sold its 19% stake in MCC to Daimler-Benz. In 1999 Swatch bought Groupe Horloger Breguet, a manufacturer of mechanical timepieces since 1775, and Swiss watch case maker Favre &amp; Perret. In 2000 the growing company pocketed German luxury watchmaker Glashütter, among others. Acquisitions in 2001 included two Greek companies, Aliki Perri and Alikonia. Swatch bought Swiss watch dial maker Rubattel &amp; Weyermann in 2002. Later that year Hayek retired as CEO, but remained chairman; his son Nicolas became CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Swatch unveiled the Paparazzi, a watch it made in collaboration with MSN Direct (a division of
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   ) which can link to updated international news, weather forecasts, and lottery results. All that, and it tells the time. The production side of business grew again in October 2006 when the company acquired watch dial maker MOM Le Prélet SA of Switzerland.
  </p>
  <p>
   Swatch subsequently struck a handful of deals with retailers to further its products. Swatch formed a retail partnership in 2006 with
   <company id="139734">
    Tourneau
   </company>
   , the world's largest watch store, to open watch stores in high-end outlet malls across the US. In 2008 it took a significant stake in luxury goods retailer Rivoli Group, based in Dubai.
  </p>
  <p>
   Swatch has also disposed of assets in order to focus on its core operations. In early 2010 the company sold the assets of its Microcomponents Ltd of Switzerland and Zhuhai SMH Watchmaking Co. subsidiaries, which produce stepper motors and clocks for automobile instrument panels, to Singapore's Juken Technology. The deal was worth some S$6 million and included the units' manufacturing centers in China and Switzerland.
  </p>
  <p>
   Founder and chairman Nicolas Hayek died upexpectedly of heart failure in June 2010. He was succeeded by vice chairman Nayla Hayek, his daughter.
