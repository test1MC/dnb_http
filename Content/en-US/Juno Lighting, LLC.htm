   Sharing its name with Jupiter's wife, Juno Lighting can bask in the light of its own glow. Doing business as Juno Lighting Group, the company makes light fixtures for commercial, institutional, and residential buildings under several brand names. Product lines comprise showcase lighting fixtures, fiber optic lighting products, and emergency and exit lighting signs using light-emitting diode (LED) technology. Other products include recessed and track-lighting systems. Under the Juno, AccuLite, and Danalite labels, the company offers LED undercabinet and casework lighting products. Founded in 1976, the company is a subsidiary of Paris-based giant

   Sales are primarily made through a network of distributors in North America. The company counts contractors and remodelers as its chief customers and it continues to drive sales through new product introductions. In 2012 it rolled out its Juno Generation 3 LED Downlights Series for residential and commercial applications. The new products offer energy savings for architects, contractors, owners, and retailers.

   Juno launches new products each year as a means for growth. It touts its assortment of LED applications that deliver reduced energy consumption, longer operating life, lower heat output, and quality illumination. Other products offer high-intensity discharge (HID), Dark Sky compliant (shielding fixtures to cut off upward light flux) advantages for accent, area and site lighting.

   To reach additional customers, Juno Lighting opened a lighting education center in Des Plaines, Illinois, in 2012. The location features interactive displays designed to deepen visitors' understanding of different lamp technologies and the fundamental principles of lighting. Earlier that year, Juno Lighting launched the Juno-exclusive WarmDim feature for its Juno Generation 3 LED Downlights Series.

  <p>
   Robert Fremont was VP of sales for a lighting company when he quit in 1956 to found Halo Lighting in Chicago. He brought some of his sales staff with him and was in the black within two months. In 1967 he sold Halo but stayed on as president. Nine years later Fremont was lit up by the entrepreneurial urge again. He quit Halo and threw the switch on Juno in 1976, launching Trac-Master (a high-quality, stylish track-lighting fixture).

   The company went public in 1983 and made a splash three years later by introducing Sloped Ceiling Down-Lights (recessed lights that shine straight down from a sloped ceiling). Juno acquired Alumitron (fluorescent lighting) and Indy Lighting (retail store lighting) in 1988. Alumitron failed to become profitable and was sold two years later. In 1992 Juno bought D. W. Barton &amp; Associates (the parent of Danalite).

   Heavy price pressures and sluggish demand dimmed Juno's earnings in 1995 and 1996. Hoping to modernize and expand its operations, Juno took possession of a new 525,000-sq.-ft. headquarters and plant facility in 1997. In response to slow stock growth and a $90 million pile of cash, a group of shareholders led by Lens Investment Management tried to elect new board members to push the company into making acquisitions or distributing the cash to shareholders. In a countermove, the company sold a controlling interest in 1999 to investment firm Fremont Investors -- no relation to CEO Fremont, who retired after the sale.

  <p>
   In 2000 Fremont Investors upped their stake in the company to 74%. That year Juno named a new CEO, Tracy Bilbrough, who headed

   ' Commercial Division, Electrical Components Group. The following year Juno acquired Acculite, a Canada-based high-intensity discharge (HID) lighting product manufacturer. In 2002 Juno acquired Alfa Lighting, maker of decorative wall sconces and bath bars which match up with track fixtures. Juno launched nine new styles of track lighting products under the Avio, Trapezia, Uno/Duo, and Gyrus brands for the commercial and residential markets in 2003.

   acquired Juno Lighting in 2005 for $610 million, including assumed debt of about $200 million. The following year Bilbrough left the company to become president and CEO of Quality Home Brands. He was succeeded by Amelia Huntington, a veteran of Square D and Schneider Electric. Years later Huntington was promoted to COO of Schneider Electric's North American Operating Division and president of Schneider Electric USA at the beginning of 2009. John Mabbott, previously Juno's SVP of sales, assumed the post of president and CEO.
