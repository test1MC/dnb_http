   Freehand gives surgeons greater precision and vision with smaller incisions. It develops, manufactures, and markets robotic imaging systems used during laparoscopic surgery. Its wee camera, mounted on a robotic arm, can be inserted along with tools into surgical incisions and then remotely controlled by the surgeon. Its systems are designed for use during bariatric, gynecological, urological, and general surgeries. The biggest advantage of the company's system is that the surgeon, not an assistant, controls the camera during the surgery. The company operates in the US and the UK. Freehand 2010 is owned by OR Productivity.

   Its products are distributed through its facilities in the UK and US, and through distributors internationally.

  <p>
   Freehand 2010 is promoting its system as a means for hospitals and private surgical practices to reduce operating room staff and save money. In addition to selling its big-ticket systems, the company anticipates a steady revenue stream from the sale of sterile single-use parts.

  <p>
   The original developer of the Freehand system,
   <company id="134217">
    Prosurgics
   </company>
   , was acquired by FreeHand Surgical in 2010. FreeHand Surgical entered administration that year and was acquired by the newly created Freehand 2010; Freehand 2010 was then acquired by another newly formed company, OR Productivity, which was established to do business in the fields of non-invasive and minimally invasive surgery.
