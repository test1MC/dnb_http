   Walker Magnetics Group custom designs and manufactures a vast line of magnetic tools for work-holding, material handling and separation applications. From electromagnetic chucks to lifting devices, recycling and separation equipment, the company caters to just about every industry (textiles to transformers, and fishing boats) that uses steel. The company's Canadian operation even built the world's largest (88-ton) suspended electromagnet, as certified by the Guinness Book of World Records. Its magnetic conveying systems are widely used by makers of cans and canned goods. Walker is owned by Alliance Holdings.

   The company continues to pull in orders from new markets: wind power. In addition to handling massive pieces of steel used to build wind towers, its electromagnetic rotary chucks grind the bearings used in wind turbines. Other Walker products include bundle handling lift systems, drilling and boring, and work-holding and clamping. The company offers related services including chuck repair, lift magnet repair, inspection, and recertification. Products, however, are reportedly built to last a lifetime, with proper upkeep and maintenance.
