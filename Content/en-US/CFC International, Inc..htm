CFC also makes holographic authentication seals (popular on tickets and software), heat transfer labels for pharmaceuticals, and magnetic strips for security and credit card uses.

  <p>
   Founder Roger Hruby (who formed the company in 1988) had controlled about 60% of CFC before ITW acquired the company in late 2006 for about $75 million. CFC had previously hired investment firm
   <company id="128675">
    Lincoln International
   </company>
   to evaluate strategic opportunities. In mid-2005, private equity firm
   <company id="142482">
    Audax Group
   </company>
   agreed to pay $109 million to purchase the company; however, the deal was later terminated. CFC then agreed to be acquired by
   <company id="118791">
    Quad-C Management
   </company>
   for $75 million, a deal that was announced in early 2006. That deal was scuttled due to concerns over CFC's product quality. (In 2006 credit card issuer
   <company id="40515">
    Visa
   </company>
   advised its member institutions to stop using CFC's magnetic strips on its cards.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2006, CFC made the deal to be acquired by
   <company id="10778">
    Illinois Tool Works
   </company>
   , a diversified manufacturing company that makes everything from nail guns to commercial kitchen appliances to electronics chemicals.
