   Whatever the
   <em>
    soup du jour
   </em>
   , Baxters can ladle it up. Located in the Scottish village of Fochabers, Baxters Food Group makes more than 150 products including canned and fresh soups. Not content with soup alone, the company also fills up its plate with preserves, condiments, pickles, and chutneys. It has also dipped its toe into retail waters with its four Baxters specialty food and gift shops, all located in Scotland. Baxters' products are widely available in the UK and distributed throughout the world. The company traces its establishment to 1868, when George Baxter started his own grocery business.

   Baxters often grows through the use of acquisitions. In 2013 it acquired Jensen's Choice Foods, through its Australian subsidiary, Baxters Food Australia. Jensen's produces a broad range of products for the grocery market including pasta sauces, salsa dips, wet spices, passata, fruit spreads, mustards, and simmer sauces. Brands include Jensen's Organic, Aunty Kath's Cookie Dough, and private label brands for all of the major grocery retailers. The deal allowed Baxters to develop a larger Australian business and is expected to provide further opportunities in both foodservice and retail.
