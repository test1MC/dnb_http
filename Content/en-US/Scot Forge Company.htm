   Scot Forge forges ahead in the business of making open-die and rolled-ring forgings used for couplings, drive shafts, flanges, heat exchanger bodies, and ship shafts. It serves customers in the construction, defense, energy, general industrial machinery, power generation, and shipbuilding industries. One of Scot Forge's signature products is the Tartan Bar, a solid-center, rolled-surface round bar of metal. Scot Forge also offers design services and has a specialty alloy services team to help customers select specialty materials for open-die forgings and rolled rings. The manufacturer, which ships more than 250 million pounds of forgings a year, was founded in 1893.

   Altogether, Scot Forge has more than 1.3 million sq. ft. of manufacturing space across its five plants in Illinois (2), Michigan (the Ringmasters plant, which is 50% owned by Scot Forge); Pennsylvania (the North American Forgemasters plant), and Wisconsin. It ships more than 250 million pounds of forgings yearly.

   Besides forming and shaping heated metal parts (temperatures range from 1900°F to 2400°F) through the use of hammering, pressing, and rolling, Scot Forge also provides saw cutting, rough machining, deep hole boring, heat treating, contour torch cutting, as well as testing. Forging offers more strength to a component in regard to directional, structural, and impact integrity. Because the process requires less starting metal and generates fewer rejections, forging has economic benefits over milling and machining.

        <p>
   The company's seven steam hammers, eight hydraulic open-die presses, four ring mills, and bar planishing mill turns out parts that weigh from 5 lbs. to 80,000 lbs. in a variety of metals, including aluminum, carbon, copper, nickel, stainless steel, and tool steel.

   Strength and Weaknesses
  </p>
        <p>
   Despite serving many industries, Scot Forge is intimately tied to one specific regional sector: mining. Mining throughout the state of Wisconsin and other nearby regions adds more jobs and new business for companies like Scot Forge. To this end, the company is dependent upon the ups and downs inherent within the mining industry -- a highlycapital-intensive sector requiring ongoing capital investment to replace, modernize, and expand equipment and facilities. The company is also susceptible to state legislation and environmental reviews allowing for mining in select areas.
