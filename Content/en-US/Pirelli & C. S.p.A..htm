   Pirelli &amp; Co. makes replacement and original equipment (OE) tires for passenger, motorsport, industrial, and commercial vehicles; motorcycles; and farm machinery at about 20 plants located in 13 countries and has a market presence spanning 160 countries on four continents. Pirelli tires are OE on certain models of
   <company id="104498">
    Maserati
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="55251">
    Lamborghini
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="91295">
    Porsche
   </company>
   . The company is also the racing tire provider for all Formula 1 teams and also offers replacement services and steel cords. The company traces its roots all the way back to when Giovanni Battista Pirelli formed the company in 1872.

  <p>
   Pirelli's largest market is Central and South America (36% of total sales). Other major markets include Europe (27%; excluding Italy), North America (11%), EMEA (8%), the Asia/Pacific (8%), Italy (6%), and Russia and CIS (4%).

  <p>
   After fighting for Italian unification with Garibaldi in the 1860s, Giovanni Battista Pirelli observed that France, not Italy, was providing rubber tubes for an Italian ship salvage attempt. The young patriot reacted by founding Pirelli &amp; Co. in Milan, Italy, in 1872 to manufacture rubber products. In 1879 Pirelli began making insulated cables for the rapidly growing telegraph industry, and by 1890 he was making bicycle tires. Pirelli introduced his first air-filled automobile tire in 1899.
  </p>
  <p>
   Foreign expansion began when Pirelli opened cable factories in Spain (1902), the UK (1914), and Argentina (1917). The company set up Societe Internationale Pirelli (SIP) in Switzerland in 1937 and consolidated all non-Italian operations within it. After WWII the group expanded along with the growth in worldwide auto sales. Pirelli began production in Turkey and Greece in 1962, and six years later it set up cable plants in Peru.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pirelli's first radial tires (early 1970s) backfired when they wore out too quickly. In 1971 the company swapped stock with tire maker Dunlop (UK). Although the firms engaged in joint research and development (R&amp;D), they never consolidated production.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pirelli S.p.A., the Italian operating company, and SIP became holding companies in 1982 by transferring their operating units into jointly owned Pirelli Societe Generale (Switzerland). That year Pirelli started producing fiber-optic cables.
  </p>
  <p>
   Heavy spending on R&amp;D and new equipment bolstered the newly unified tire business. The 1986 purchase of Metzeler Kautscuk (Germany) made Pirelli one of the world's largest motorcycle tire manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pirelli S.p.A. became an operating company in 1988 when it bought SIP's Pirelli Societe Generale holdings. It launched a hostile bid for Firestone through Pirelli Tyre, but was outbid by
   <company id="41861">
    Bridgestone
   </company>
   . Pirelli settled for the much smaller Armstrong Tire. In 1989 Pirelli sold nearly 24% of Pirelli Tyre to the public.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 Pirelli proposed an unusually complex and convoluted merger with
   <company id="42384">
    Continental AG
   </company>
   (Germany) designed to leave Pirelli in control. Continental declined, but negotiations continued throughout 1991 until Continental terminated the talks after learning of Pirelli's deteriorating financial condition.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pirelli became a top power-cable maker with operations in more than 20 countries in 1998 by acquiring Germany-based
   <company id="41843">
    Siemens
   </company>
   ' power cable unit in a $277 million deal. The following year Pirelli agreed to ally with
   <company id="10406">
    Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber
   </company>
   , including an arrangement whereby Cooper would distribute and sell Pirelli tires for passenger cars and light trucks in the US, Canada, and Mexico. In return, Pirelli agreed to sell Cooper tires in South America. Additionally, Pirelli Cables Australia acquired Metal Manufacturers Ltd's energy cable business to strengthen its market share down under.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Pirelli unveiled a compact, computerized manufacturing system designed to cut the cost of tire production by about 25%, while raising tire quality. In 2000 Pirelli sold its terrestrial optical systems business to
   <company id="13494">
    Cisco Systems
   </company>
   for a little more than $2 billion; Cisco agreed to invest $100 million in Pirelli's optical components and undersea cable transmissions divisions. Also in 2000 the company sold its fiber-optic telecommunications business to
   <company id="10409">
    Corning
   </company>
   for about $3.6 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company separated energy cables and systems from its telecom business to focus on new growth and reached an alliance agreement with
   <company id="106060">
    Alloptic
   </company>
   to develop network fiber-optic solutions for commercial and home markets. In a surprise announcement, Pirelli announced that it and the Benetton family had agreed to buy the 23% controlling stake in
   <company id="41826">
    Olivetti
   </company>
   -- controlled by Roberto Colaninno, the CEO of both Olivetti and
   <company id="42394">
    Telecom Italia
   </company>
   . Pirelli sold its enameled wire holdings in late 2002 to Investitori Associati, an Italy-based investment group. After merging its operating company (Pirelli SpA) and holding company (Pirelli &amp; C. SpA) in 2003, the company changed its name to Pirelli &amp; C. SpA. The following year Pirelli sold its interest in Afcab, a South Africa-based cable manufacturer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pirelli's two cable divisions were sold in 2005. They included energy (low-, medium-, and high-voltage power cables and building wire products) and telecommunications (cable assemblies, hardware, and fiber-optics). The company sold the divisions to
   <company id="40176">
    Goldman Sachs
   </company>
   in a deal worth about $1.6 billion, including debt, and they are now known as Prysmian Cables &amp; Systems. Pirelli kept some tech-related operations through Pirelli Broadband Solutions and Pirelli Labs, which it divested down the road.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company purchased real estate firms in Germany and Poland and launched operations in Romania in 2008, but soon after, it made the decision to focus on its core tire business. In 2009 Pirelli sold its stake in Submarine Networks (submarine telecom systems) to
   <company id="41751">
    Alcatel-Lucent
   </company>
   , the parent company of Submarine Networks, for about €56 million (about $75 million). In fall 2010 the company divested its more than 56% stake in Pirelli &amp; C. Real Estate (Pirelli RE). Once the spinoff occurred, Pirelli RE's name changed to Prelios. Pirelli in late 2010 also unloaded its Pirelli Broadband unit to Switzerland-based Advanced Digital Broadcast Holdings (ADB) in a deal valued at approximately €30 million ($42 million). It also sold
   <company id="100566">
    Oclaro
   </company>
   (formerly Avanex) and its stake in
   <company id="143922">
    CyOptics
   </company>
   in 2010.
