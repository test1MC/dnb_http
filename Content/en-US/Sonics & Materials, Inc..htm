   . Sonics &amp; Materials makes standard and customized equipment that uses sound to bond thermoplastic components, textiles, and other synthetic materials. The ultrasonic process creates clean welding of metal and materials that are difficult to bond by other means; it also offers liquid processing (dispersing, blending, cleaning), and food cutting. The company serves a broad range of customers, including appliance, automotive, chemical, consumer products, industrial, medical, packaging, synthetic textile, and toy manufacturers.

   Sonics &amp; Materials designs and produces handheld, benchtop, and semi-automated plastics assembly systems. Its assembly systems include microprocessor-controlled ultrasonic welders, vibration welders, spin welders, and hot-plate welders. While other plastics assembly processes may include glues and adhesives, Sonics &amp; Materials' clean welding equipment, which uses frictional heat created by force and motion to create a bond, allows a company to save on the expense of additional capital investments in adhesive products. The company also offers a digital ultrasonic power supply unit, which is 30% smaller than its analog counterpart and offers more flexibility in function and features.
