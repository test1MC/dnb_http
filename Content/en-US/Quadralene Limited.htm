  <p>
   In a move to counter the effects of the economic recession, the company has been branching out into new markets, especially in the healthcare industry. Quadralene's turnover in 2010 was reported as £3.2 million (about $5.1 million). Healthcare products contributed 30% of its sales. The company expected to grow at least 50% in 2011, and to make £20 million ($32.2 million) by 2015.

   In 2012 the company launched its Biocleanse Ultra brand, part of the Dentisan product portfolio for medical device surfaces for dental practices. Biocleanse Ultra is a new version of the company's original Biocleanse; it is a wide-spectrum microbiocide based on alcohol-free technology with a pH neutral formulation. The cleaner and disinfectant has been developed to fight against mycobacteria, including TB, viruses such as Hepatitis B and C, HIV, fungi, and yeast.
