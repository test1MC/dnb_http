   <company id="103700">

   , Holophane makes lighting fixtures and systems for industrial, commercial, and outdoor markets.

Holophane also makes lighting products for large outdoor areas such as highway interchanges, and it offers commercial and institutional lighting for schools and offices. Its ISD SuperGlass prismatic lighting technology allows reflectors to cast more light.

   As with many companies in the broadly defined construction and renovation supply industries (paints, construction supplies, household fixtures, etc.), Holophane's business has evolved recently to depend on home improvement centers more and more. For instance,
   <company id="11470">
    Home Depot
   </company>
   alone accounted for 13% of parent company Acuity Brands' sales in 2013.

   Other clients include electrical distributors, retail home improvement centers, electric utilities, utility distributors, national accounts, government and municipalities, lighting showrooms, original equipment manufacturers, and energy service companies.
