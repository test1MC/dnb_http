   The European Space Agency (ESA) manages Europe's journey into space. Its mission is to develop Europe's space capability by engaging in space research and developing satellite-based technologies and services that promote European industries. Although the agency maintains close ties with the EU, it is not directly affiliated with it. ESA has 22 member states--by coordinating the financial and intellectual resources of its member sates, it manages programs that extend beyond the capability of any single member country. ESA's 22 members include Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK.

   Although ESA is headquartered in France, it has centers elsewhere in Europe, including the European Space Research and Technology Center (ESTEC), the design hub for most ESA spacecraft and technology development, located in the Netherlands; the European Space Operations Center (ESOC), which is responsible for controlling ESA satellites in orbit and is located in Germany; the European Astronauts Center (EAC), which trains astronauts for missions and also is located Germany; and the European Space Research Institute (ESRIN), which is responsible for collecting, storing, and distributing satellite data to ESA's partners, acts as the Agency's information technology centre, and is based Italy. In addition, ESA has offices in Belgium, Russia, and the US; a launch base in French Guiana; and ground and tracking stations in other parts of the world.
