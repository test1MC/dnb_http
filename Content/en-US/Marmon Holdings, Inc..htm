        <p>
   Marmon was formed in 1953. The Marmon Group name was adopted in 1964 after the acquisition of the Marmon-Herrington Company, successor to the Marmon Motor Car Company that built the car that won the first Indianapolis 500 in 1911.
  </p>
        <p>
   Chicago's Pritzker family (owners of the Hyatt hotel chain) united several manufacturing companies under the Marmon name in 1953. They sold a majority interest to Berkshire Hathaway for $4.5 billion in 2008. An agreement between the parties calls for the investment firm to acquire all of Marmon by 2014.
  </p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Although the history of The Marmon Group officially begins in 1953, the company's roots are in the Chicago law firm Pritzker and Pritzker, started by Nicholas Pritzker in 1902. Through the firm, the family made connections with First National Bank of Chicago, which A. N. Pritzker, Nicholas' son, used to get a line of credit to buy real estate. By 1940 the firm had stopped accepting outside clients to concentrate on the family's growing investment portfolio.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1953 A. N.'s son Jay used his father's connections to get a loan to buy Colson Company, a small, money-losing manufacturer of bicycles, hospital equipment, and other products. Jay's brother, Robert, a graduate of the
   <company id="118057">
    Illinois Institute of Technology
   </company>
   , took charge of Colson and turned it around. Soon Jay began acquiring more companies for his brother to manage.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1963 the brothers paid $2.7 million for about 45% of the Marmon-Herrington Company (whose predecessor, Marmon Motor Car, built the car that in 1911 won the first Indianapolis 500). The family now had a name for its industrial holdings -- The Marmon Group.
  </p>
        <p>
   It became a public company in 1966 when it merged with door- and spring-maker Fenestra. However, Jay began to take greater control of the group through a series of stock purchases, and by 1971 The Marmon Group was private once again.
  </p>
        <p>
   A year earlier, in 1970, the group acquired a promising industrial pipe supplier, Keystone Tubular Service (which later became Marmon/Keystone). In 1973 Marmon began to acquire stock in Cerro Corp., which had operations in mining, manufacturing, trucking, and real estate; by 1976 the group had bought all of Cerro, thereby tripling its revenues. The brothers sold Cerro's trucking subsidiary, ICX, in 1977 and bought organ maker Hammond Corp., along with
   <company id="106145">
    Wells Lamont
   </company>
   , Hammond's glove-making subsidiary.
  </p>
        <p>
   Marmon acquired conglomerate
   <company id="99791">
    Trans Union
   </company>
   in 1981. Trans Union brought many operations, including railcar and equipment leasing, credit information services, international trading, and water- and wastewater-treatment systems. In 1982 Jay acquired Ticketmaster (now part of
   <company id="55576">
    Live Nation Entertainment
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
        <p>
   The Pritzkers made a foray into the airline business in 1984 by buying Braniff Airlines. After unsuccessfully bidding for
   <company id="57540">
    Pan Am
   </company>
   in 1987, they sold Braniff in 1988. Disappointments in other Pritzker businesses didn't slow Marmon, which added to its transportation equipment business in 1984 with Altamil, a maker of products for the trucking and aerospace industries.
  </p>
        <p>
   To mark its 40th anniversary, the company sponsored a car, the Marmon Wasp II, at the 1993 Indianapolis 500. That year the Pritzkers sold 80% of Ticketmaster to
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   co-founder Paul Allen but retained a minority interest. Marmon sold Arzco Medical Systems in 1995, and Marmon/Keystone acquired Anbuma Group, a Belgian steel tubing distributor.
  </p>
        <p>
   The Anbuma purchase and Marmon/Keystone's 1997 acquisition of UK tube distributor Wheeler Group exemplified Marmon's practice of building strength through acquisitions in its established markets. In 1998 Marmon purchased more than 30 companies and opened a business development office in Beijing.
  </p>
        <p>
   Marmon splashed out more than $500 million in 1999 to make 35 acquisitions, including Kerite (power cables), OsteoMed (specialty medical devices), and Bridport (medical and aviation products). Jay died that year, and the company announced that his title of chairman would not be filled.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2000 Marmon spent another $500 million on more than 20 acquisitions, buying operations engaged in the production of retail display equipment, tank containers, and metal products, among others.
  </p>
        <p>
   Former
   <company id="10778">

   </company>
   (ITW) chief John Nichols took over the Marmon CEO responsibilities from Robert Pritzker in 2001. The company again went to ITW when Nichols retired at the end of 2005, hiring former vice chairman Frank Ptak.
  </p>
        <p>
   Also in 2005, the company spun off Trans Union, the consumer credit information services provider. Penny Pritzker, the independent Trans Union chairman, said that the separation would better allow the company to grow, as Trans Union is a technology and information company as opposed to Marmon's stable of manufacturing businesses. The Trans Union separation, however, served as a precursor to the decision to sell off the remainder of the Marmon Group companies in order to more easily divide the family holdings. Infighting among family members over the division of the family fortune began to intensify shortly after Jay's death in 1999.
  </p>
        <p>
   Majority ownership of The Marmon Group (now Marmon Holdings) was acquired by

   in 2008.
