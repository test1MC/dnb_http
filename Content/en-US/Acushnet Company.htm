    Beam Inc.

   (formerly

   Fila Korea, which makes sport and leisure footwear and apparel and owns the global Fila brand, led the transaction alongside Mirae Asset Private Equity. With Acushnet under its umbrella, Fila Korea is looking to leverage the company's iconic golf brands for expansion throughout Asia.

   Being purchased by Fila Korea couldn't have been better for Acushnet. The company has been shifting its focus to foreign markets, particularly in the Asia/Pacific region, as the US recovered from the economic downturn. International markets account for about 45% of total revenue. Indeed, the US recession has had a stinging effect on the golf supplier, which pared down its operations in recent years amid plunging demand. To this end, Acushnet in 2010 sold its Cobra Golf business to
   <company id="91292">
    PUMA
   </company>
   , which viewed the golf category as having growth potential despite challenging economic factors. The deal included the Cobra Golf brand, its inventory, intellectual property, and endorsement contracts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Product innovation and brand loyalty are the key components of Acushnet's success. The company relies on aggressive protection of its technology patents and effective marketing, often using endorsements of tour and club professionals.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's speculated that the company is aiming to go public in 2016 in an effort to expand further. Fila Korea intends to maintain a 33% equity position afterward.
