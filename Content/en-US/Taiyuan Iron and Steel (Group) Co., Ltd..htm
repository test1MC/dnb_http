   This company's position in the steel industry has been hard fought. For some time Taiyuan Iron &amp; Steel (TISCO) has been China's largest stainless steel producer, but the company was never satisfied with that distinction alone. Expansion efforts have increased its annual production to 3 million tons, making it the world's largest supplier. TICSO's total steel production output is more than 12 million tons. Its other products include boiler, naval, pure iron, vessel, low alloy, die, and alloy structure plates; quality carbon steel; and structure carbon steel. Taiyuan has a joint venture with

    Harsco Corp.
   </company>
   which processes and recovers by-products from stainless and carbon steel slag production.
