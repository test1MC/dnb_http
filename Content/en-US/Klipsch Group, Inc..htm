   In fiscal 2015, VOXX International's Premium Audio revenue declined 12% to $165.8 million. (The segment accounted for 22% of the parent company's total revenues.) Premium Audio, including Klipsch, had lower earnings on products including soundbars and Bluetooth speakers due to lower sales prices; headphones sales were hurt by competition. Although the company saw growth in certain high-end items and custom installations, currency exchange rates offset those gains.

   The company has expanded its portfolio of audio products in recent years to meet demand generated by the popularity of smartphones and other mobile devices. It offers headphones featuring oval-shaped earbuds, which are styled to fit more comfortably inside listeners' ears. Klipsch also makes on-ear headphones and sets with mic and remote systems (which can be used with mobile phones). Other products include the LightSpeaker, a multi-room wireless audio system equipped with a dimmable LED bulb that can be installed in recessed lighting fixtures.

   In 2015 the company introduced an ultra-portable Bluetooth speaker; it also launched the powerful minimalist speaker R-15PM.

   In 2011 consumer electronics powerhouse Audiovox (now
   <company id="11736">
    VOXX International
   </company>
   ) paid nearly $170 million to acquire Klipsch. Today the company operates as a subsidiary of VOXX, which was enticed to purchase Klipsch for its ongoing R&amp;D efforts and diversified following in both the home and professional audio segments. Buying Klipsch gave Audiovox another world-class brand name, boosted its distribution network in the US and abroad, and provided entry into the high-end residential and commercial installation markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Klipsch was founded in 1946 by audio engineer Paul W. Klipsch (designer of the Klipschorn loudspeaker).
