   Want cheese with that, Schreiber Foods asks. The company is a major supplier of cheese used in hamburgers and other dishes served by US fast food chains and restaurants, schools and universities, hospitals, and other foodservice operators. Schreiber produces some 575 private-label processed and natural cheeses, as well as dairy ingredients, for grocers, club stores, wholesalers, and food manufacturers. It also offers its own brands, including American Heritage and Cooper, for retail sale. Schreiber has expanded its presence to 20 countries by acquiring or forming joint ventures with smaller cheese makers. Boasting $5 billion in annual revenue, Schreiber is believed to be the world's largest employee-owned dairy company.

   Schreiber Foods has been expanding in Europe by opening and acquiring new facilities (especially yogurt plants) in new markets. In 2015, one year after its entry into the European yogurt market with plant openings in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Portugal, and Spain, the company purchased three European yogurt plants in Zvolen, Slovakia; and Noblejas and Talavera, Spain from French dairy firm Senoble International. The Slovakia facility manufactured its own private label dairy products and its own brand (Zvolensky), while the two facilities in Spain manufactured dairy desserts and yogurts for local retailer Mercadona, helping to deepen Schreiber's existing relationship with the retailer.

  <p>
   The company prides itself in being innovative, launching measures that have cut waste and production times. In 2015, for example, the company explained that it had developed an "interleaf" method for stacking cheese slices (without paper in between slices), which reduced paper use by 400,000 pounds per year and made it easier for customers to grab the cheese. It also said it was the first in the industry to shorten packaging for 8-ounce shredded cheese by two inches, which used 10% less packaging per bag, freed up valuable retail shelf space for customers, and cut packaging changeover times in half at its plants.

  <p>
   Schreiber Foods strategically locates its US distribution centers (which make up more than half of its global facilities base) to ensure that it can ship its dairy products anywhere in the continental US in one day. The company also pursues joint ventures as a way to win new business and add local capacity.

   In the past, the company has pursued acquisitions that have taken advantage of Americans' appetite for healthier options. In 2010, Schreiber Foods expanded its European presence after acquiring a 51% stake in a joint venture with Austrian cheese maker Rupp. Known as Schreiber &amp; Rupp, the venture catered to the Continental market for private-label cheese and food manufacturing. In 2011, Schreiber Foods acquired the customer-brand yogurt business of
