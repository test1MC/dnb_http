   Achaogen wants to arm us all against pathogens, especially the really nasty ones. The clinical-stage pharmaceutical company is developing antibacterials to treat multi-drug resistant infections, the kind usually found in hospital environments. Its lead candidate, plazomicin, is on the fast-track for
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval to treat serious and life-threatening drug-resistant bacterial infections. Achaogen's plazomicin development is partially funded by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the
   <company id="150448">
    Department of Health and Human Services
   </company>
   . Other candidates target
   <em>
    e. coli
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    pseudomonas aeruginosa
   </em>
   , which causes severe pneumonia. Achaogen was formed in 2004 and went public in 2014.

  <p>
   The company raised $72 million and plans to use its IPO proceeds to fund R&amp;D, first for plazomicin, then for other candidates.

  <p>
   Achaogen has only had revenue from its BARDA contract. It has operated at a loss every years since its founding and expects to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. The company has an accumulated deficit of nearly $130 million.

  <p>
   To become profitable, Achaogen plans to get plazomicin approved in the US and EU, begin marketing the drug itself in the US while using partners elsewhere, and continue developing additional drugs to treat multi-drug resistant infections.
