   When it comes to keeping the transportation industry on the move after dark, Dialight shines. The company makes energy-efficient LED lights and signals used in airport, bus, rail, and traffic applications. In addition, its products are used to illuminate and identify radio towers, wind turbines, warehouses, parking structures, military shelters, and hazardous locations. Dialight also makes electromagnetic components for smart meter switches used to manage the supply of electricity remotely. About two-thirds of Dialight's sales come from North America. Outside of the UK, the company has operations in Australia, Denmark, Germany, Mexico, and the US.

  <p>
   The company's Lighting segment provides energy efficient lighting products with high-brightness LEDs and connected technologies. It accounted for 75% of the Dialight's revenue in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Lighting business provides lighting products to customers and the obstruction business provides LED lighting used for aircraft collision avoidance in the onshore telecom and broadcast tower market and offshore wind turbine markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Signals and Components division provides LED lighting for signals and components to electronics original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") for automotive and niche industrial applications. The division generated 25% of the company's 2015 revenue.

  <p>
   The Dialight Group is headquartered in the UK with manufacturing facilities in Brazil, Denmark, Malaysia, Mexico, the US, and the UK.  Customers in North America accounted for 67% of sales in 2015, followed by Europe with 10%, and the UK, 7%. The combine revenue from other markets is 16% of the group's total.

  <p>
   Dialight's customers include steel foundries, pulp and paper mills, automotive manufacturers, utility and waste water plants, oil and gas and mining, and food and beverage processing plants. A high proportion of Lighting sales, particularly in the US, are through major distribution networks. The business also sells directly to major international customers and has strategic links with key automation partners. Oil and gas customers generated 22% of sales in 2015.

  <p>
   Dialight's revenue rose slightly, reported a loss for 2015 .
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales increased 1% in 2015 from 2014. Lighting segment sales rose 35 in 2015, but sales for the Signal and Components division slumped 5%. Lighting growth slowed in the second and third quarters of 2015 with retrenchment in the upstream oil and gas sector. Sales for Signals and Components slowed because of production inefficiencies and lower prices from increased competition.
  </p>
  <p>
   The £2 loss, compared to a £9 million profit in 2014, stemmed from higher administrative expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations was £4.4 million in 2015, a decrease from 2014's figure.

  <p>
   In 2016 Dialight restructured its operations to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. The company is focused on opportunities in LED lighting, building on its market-leading position in Lighting and Obstruction. The company consolidated them into one segment, named Lighting. Dialight also consolidated the traffic, transport and components businesses into one segment, Signals and Components. The company said it will concentrate on supply chain planning, especially when it cmes to quality of supplies, material cost, and reducing waste.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another part of the restructuring was the closing or sale of plants in the UK to reduce costs. The company is developing manufacturing partnerships that, if successful, would be rolled out to all its products lines. The partnerships allow the company to respond more quickly to changes in the market.
