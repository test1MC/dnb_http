   You can't hide from American Science and Engineering (AS&amp;E). The company makes X-ray detection systems for inspection and security at airports, border stations, military situations, shipping ports, high-security facilities, and law enforcement scenarios. Using a lower radiation dose than typical systems, AS&amp;E's Z Backscatter technology detects organic materials such as illegal drugs, plastic explosives, and plastic weapons. AS&amp;E also makes scanning equipment for detecting contraband on persons, in aircraft, vehicles, and in luggage and packages. About 40% of sales are to the US government and its contractors; top customers include Al Hamra Group Sal Offshore and

    US Customs and Border Protection
   </company>
   . In late 2016 AS&amp;E was acquired by OSI Systems.

  <p>
   AS&amp;E makes nearly half its money from its inspection systems for cargo. The mobile cargo inspection system unit hauls in 27% of revenue while the cargo inspection system unit accounts for 22%. Another 40% of revenue came from providing service while systems that scan parcels and people and other products accounted for 11% of revenue.

  <p>
   Based in Billerica, Massachusetts, AS&amp;E has offices in Brazil, Europe, Hong Kong, Mexico, the Middle East, and Singapore. International customers accounted for about 60% of the company's sales in 2015 (ended March).

   AS&amp;E sales staff represents the company throughout the world, mostly to government agencies. About 37% of the company's sales are to the US government direct or to contractors working for the US government.

  <p>
   AS&amp;E posted its fourth straight year of declining revenue in 2015 (ended March) when it reported $127 million in sales, a 33% drop from 2014. The company blamed the lower sales on final installation of multiunit contracts in its Cargo Inspection unit and lower product volume in the Mobile Cargo Inspection unit. Service revenue dropped 26% as the withdrawal of US forces from Iraq in 2014 reduced or ended a number of service contracts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income came in just less than $1 million in 2015 on the revenue decrease. Cash flow reversed to a negative $11 million in 2015 from a positive $32 million in 2014.

  <p>
   AS&amp;E is looking for bigger growth with smaller customers. For example, it miniaturized its best-seller, the ZBV system, to create the Mini Z. The new product has a lower price and is aimed at a broader range of customers with lower budgets. The company also revamped its sales channels and brought in new leaders in key areas. One new hire, the chief scientist, will look to expand in the company's current markets and leverage its technologies into new markets.
