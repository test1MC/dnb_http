   Del Global Technologies can see the beauty of the inner you. And your pet. The firm's Medical Systems group makes medical and dental X-ray systems used by hospitals and doctors, dentists, and veterinarians. It sells its products through distributors worldwide under the Villa brand name; it also provides some of its products to OEMs under private-label agreements. Through its RFI subsidiary, Del Global Technologies' Power Conversion Group makes precision electronic components and sub-assemblies for makers of everything from weapons systems to satellites to MRI machines; brands include RFI, Filtron, Sprague, and Stanley. The company was formed in 1954.

   Engineers Joseph Delcau, Raymond Kaufman, and Hugo DiGiovanni founded the company in 1954 as Del (as in Delcau) Electronics. It originally made only precision power conversion products. Over the next 30 years Del grew as an electronics engineering firm, mainly designing and manufacturing products for the defense industry. Leonard Trugman joined Del in 1985 and began transforming it, primarily through acquisitions. Del purchased RFI in 1989 and its first medical products company, Porta Ray (now DynaRad), in 1992. In 1994 the company acquired Bertan High Voltage and formed Del Medical Systems.

   Del bought the Gendex Medical Division (a designer and manufacturer of X-ray systems) of DENTSPLY International in 1996. The company changed its name to Del Global Technologies that year to reflect its repositioning as a diverse worldwide electronics corporation. The following year it received a $25 million contract to supply a leading medical equipment maker with radiographic imaging systems, and in 1998 the company won US government approval to market its neonatal imaging system. Also that year the company bought Acoma Medical Imaging, boosting its capabilities in fluoroscopy, which converts X-rays to electronic images.

   To emphasize the "global" in its name, Del bought the majority of Italian portable imaging system maker Villa Sistemi Medicali in 1999, establishing a presence in that market.

   After years of earnings growth, the company surprised Wall Street by announcing that earnings for 2000 would be lower than the previous year (and that quarterly reports for the year would be revised); it also said 1999's earnings might have to be restated. The announcement was the first in a series of events that rocked the company through late 2000 and into 2001. Several officers and board members (including CEO, president, and chairman Trugman) resigned or were terminated; the company announced its annual filing with the SEC would be delayed; the SEC launched an investigation involving the company's financial statements; and the company was delisted from the Nasdaq.
  </p>

   The company got in trouble again with the government in 2004, pleading guilty to fraud for not adequately testing  the electrical radio frequency filters it was supplying to the US military. As part of a strategic review that the company underwent at about the same time, Del Global sold its High Voltage division to Spellman High Voltage Electronics.
