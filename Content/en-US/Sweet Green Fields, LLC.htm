   It's sweet. It's green. It's ... Reb-A? Sweet Green Fields (SGF) makes an all-natural sweetener from the stevia plant, a nearly pure form of stevia-derived Rebaudioside-A (or Reb-A), which is up to 300 times sweeter than natural sugar. The zero-calorie ingredient is also low glycemic so it doesn't cause a spike in blood sugar that can be dangerous to diabetics. Reb-A's intensity, natural origins, and lack of calories makes it very attractive to food and beverage makers the world over. SGF offers a 97% and an 80% Reb-A product made at its Chinese extraction facility; the company grows the plants in Hawaii, thereby controlling the entire production process.

  <p>
   The company offers its products throughout Australia and New Zealand.

  <p>
   SGF integrates three key areas to create extraordinarily tasting naturally sweetened stevia products: Product Development and Formulation; Agriculture Research and Development; and Extraction and Supply Chain Excellence. SGF formulates reduced sugar applications in beverages, dairy, baking, and confectionery.

   SGF doesn't want anything to stand in the way of snackfood makers flocking to its door so it also offers custom-formulation assistance for replacing sugar or diet sweeteners with Reb-A. Since
   <company id="11166">

   , respectively) to produce their own versions of a stevia-based sweetener, SGF will have to chase the smaller fish in the snack and beverage ocean. But given the estimated $780 million market for stevia sweeteners, there are plenty of fish in the sweet sea.

  <p>
   In 2015 SGF launched a breakthrough in taste of stevia, Intesse, a proprietary, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives  compliant Non-GMO blend of active steviol glycosides (stevia compounds), which offers customers a sweetness profile extremely close to sugar with added health benefits, and a significantly reduced bitterness and lingering profile compared with other stevia sweeteners.

   Stevia has been used in South America, especially in its native Paraguay, for centuries, and it has been approved by Japanese food regulators since the 1970s. In 2008 the
