   Cobra Electronics' citizens band radios and radar detectors are good buddies when you're on the road. Its principal namesake division markets Cobra-branded CB and marine radios, two-way radios, radar detectors, power inverters, jump-starters, and GPS navigation systems. It serves professional drivers. The firm's PPL unit peddles personal navigation systems and speed camera location detectors under the Snooper name. Cobra Electronics also manages the AURA database of photo-enforcement locations (including speed camera and red-light detector positions) in North America and Europe. Cobra's products are sold in the US, Canada, and Europe through consumer electronics stores, discount retailers, and truck stops.

  </p>
  <p>
   Suppliers are located in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea.

  <p>
   Cobra logged $111.2 million in sales in fiscal 2013, a 6% drop vs. 2012. Contributing to the decrease were lower sales of truck navigation, CB radios, inverters, and detectors while Cobra generated higher sales of two-way radios and marine products. The company also introduced its Dash Cam products during the reporting period.
  </p>
  <p>
   The electronics maker posted a $1.1 million loss in 2013 as compared to a profit of $3.2 million the year earlier, thanks to lower sales and an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses. Following a 2012 cash flow of $1.5 million, Cobra reported a $3.5 million cash flow from operations in 2013.

It has launched Cobra iRadar, a speed and red-light camera detector that also allows users to control its settings via smartphones, and Cobra PhoneLynx, a system that enables users to make and receive mobile phone calls from phones in any home or small office.
