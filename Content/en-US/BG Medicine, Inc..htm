   BG Medicine wants to fill big gaps in diagnostic medicine. The biosciences researcher specializes in developing biomarkers (substances used to detect disease at a molecular level) that enable research into the causes of disease and the effectiveness of drugs used to treat them. Products in commercialization, development, and discovery stages include molecular diagnostic tests for heart disease, neurological disorders, and immune-system ailments. BG Medicine also provides drug research and development services to global pharmaceutical makers, US government agencies, and other health care organizations. The company, built through venture capital backing, held its IPO in 2011.

  <p>
   BG Medicine first announced its public offering plans in 2007, but withdrew its plan in 2008, citing unfavorable market conditions. With hopes of better market conditions, the company's second IPO filing occurred in 2010, but progressed at a leisurely pace before pricing in 2011. BG Medicine is using proceeds to fund commercialization efforts for its patented BGM Galectin-3 product and to develop other novel diagnostic tests, including multivariate index assays. It also engages in collaborative research studies, using data and patient samples to advance development of new product candidates.

  <p>
   BGM Galectin-3 test measures galectin-3, a protein involved in heart failure, and can help doctors predict whether a heart disease patient's condition will worsen. It's sold in the US and Europe. The company's next candidate in the pipeline is BGM CardioSCORE Test, a biomarker blood test to check for near-term risk of cardiovascular events like stroke and heart attack. BG Medicine has hit pause on the new test, however, to focus on supporting sales and extending new product lines of the BGM Galectin-3 test.

   The company uses third-party manufacturer

    Corgenix Medical
   </company>
   to make its BGM Galectin-3 test.

  <p>
   BG Medicine sells its BGM Galectin-3 heart disease test in Europe and the US. It has partial EU approval for BGM CardioSCORE but is putting commercialization on hold to focus on its fully approved product.

  <p>
   After years of declining revenue, things began to look up in 2013 as sales of BGM Galectin-3 picked up and delivered a 30% increase in revenue, from $3 million to $4 million. Product revenue lead the pack as US sales increased while service revenue improved due to the closing of a research project. Since its product is relatively new on the market, it's no surprise that BG Medicine has seen years of net losses. However, as with revenue, things are looking up. It posted $8 million less in losses for 2013 than in 2012, $16 million instead of $24 million. At the end of 2013 the company had total accumulated losses of $153 million but with falling R&amp;D costs and rising revenue, the company is beginning to fill in the hole. Net loss is also keeping cash from operations flowing out but that's also slowing; it was $21 million in 2012 and $15 million in 2013.

  <p>
   In order to continue revenue growth and make up its losses, BG Medicine must continue to increase sales of its approved products. To that end, the company decided in 2013 to halt commercialization of CardioSCORE in order to focus on promoting various iterations of Galectin-3.
