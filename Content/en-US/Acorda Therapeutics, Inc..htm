   Acorda Therapeutics hopes its products really get on your nerves. The company is developing prescription drugs that aim to restore neurological function for patients with central nervous system disorders. The company's marketed drugs include Ampyra, which enhances conduction in nerves damaged from multiple sclerosis (MS); Zanaflex, a muscle spasm controller; and Qutenza, which treats post-shingles nerve pain. Acorda is working with
   <company id="13209">
    Biogen
   </company>
   to market Ampyra outside the US. Acorda's other drug candidates include potential new therapies for MS and other central nervous system disorders, as well as cardiac conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
   Sales of commercial products have helped Acorda increase its product revenues in recent years, with Ampyra as the company's main breadwinner that the firm hopes will drive growth in future years. The drug is the first to improve the functionality of damaged nerve fibers; other MS treatments generally treat symptoms or slow its progression.
   <company id="13209">
    Biogen
   </company>
   holds rights to market Ampyra outside of the US and pays royalties to Acorda on the drug's sales. Biogen has gained approval for Ampyra (known internationally as Fampyra) in markets including Australia, Canada, Israel, and the European Union.
  </p>
  <p>
   Zanaflex, on the other hand, has seen dwindling sales as the capsules have generic competition. (Zanaflex tablets are still under patent protection.) Acorda markets its own authorized generic capsule version with
   <company id="12311">
    Allergan
   </company>
   (formerly Actavis) in order to offset losses. In addition, Acorda is stepping up efforts to broaden its product offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Qutenza patch, which utilizes capsaicin from chili peppers, is formulated to manage post-shingles nerve pain. The company has commercialization and development rights for the drug in the Americas, but it may face competition after its marketing exclusivity in the US expired in 2016. Acorda acquired Qutenza from NeurogesX in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company doesn't have its own manufacturing operations; it instead uses Patheon and
   <company id="162547">
    Alkermes
   </company>
   as its third-party manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acorda's candidate pipeline includes treatments for Parkinson's disease, seizures, and post-stroke walking deficits.

  <p>
   Acorda has locations in New York and Massachusetts.

  <p>
   Acorda markets its products in the US through a direct sales force that targets neurologists and other specialists, as well as primary care physicians, specialty pharmacies, hospitals, managed care companies, and drug distribution companies. It has some 90 sales representatives in all. Additionally, the firm distributes products through specialty pharmacy providers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Zanaflex capsules are distributed through wholesale distributors and Qutenza is delivered by specialty distributors Besse Medical and ASD Specialty Healthcare.

  <p>
   Acorda's revenue has been climbing for the past five years. In 2015 it rose 23% to $492.7 million on higher product revenues, which increased 25% that year. The company also recognizes license and royalty revenues for the sale of Fampyra outside of the US; combined, those totaled some $20 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income, which spiked in 2012 to $155 million, declined the following year and has yet to recover. In fiscal 2015 net income fell 37% to $11.1 million, as research and development, cost of sales, and other operating expenses increased.

  <p>
   The company is focused on increasing sales of Ampyra. It is also looking to add new uses for Ampyra, which was first approved as a therapy to improve the ability to walk in people who suffer from MS. The firm is developing the drug for additional MS-related functional impairment indications, as well as for potential use in cerebral palsy and chronic stroke treatment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In its internal R&amp;D programs, Acorda is exploring applications for its nerve and tissue repair technologies in cardiology and neurology fields. For instance in addition to the Ampyra development programs, the company has candidates for treatment of spinal cord injury, stroke, epilepsy, and heart failure, as well as a new potential treatment for MS.

  <p>
   In 2016 Acorda agreed to buy
   <company id="139673">
    Biotie Therapies
   </company>
   , a Finland-based biotech firm with an advanced clinical-stage program for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Biotie's San Francisco operations will be maintained after the acquisition; the future of its headquarters in Finland will be decided later on.
