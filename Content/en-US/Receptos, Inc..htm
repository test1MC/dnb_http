   Biopharmaceutical company Receptos hopes its drug candidates are well-received by patients suffering from autoimmune diseases. Receptos' lead candidate, an oral treatment for relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS), modifies a key white blood cell receptor and effectively aims to temper the immune system's exaggerated response to disease inflammation. The company has other candidates in its pipeline to treat diabetes and eosinophilic esophagitis (food allergy-driven inflammation of the esophagus). Receptos will seek to commercialize its products in the US, Europe, and other markets. Formed in 2008, the company went public in 2013 and was acquired by

    Celgene
   </company>
   for $7.2 billion in 2015.

   Celgene acquired the company to add Receptos' ozanimod candidate to its portfolio of immune-inflammatory disease therapies.

  <p>
   As is the case with many biopharmaceutical companies developing drug candidates, Receptos operates at a loss and has since its inception. It does not generate revenue from the sale of products; however, it does bring in a small amount of revenue from collaborative research and development activities with partners like
   <company id="144922">
    Ono Pharmaceutical Co.
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10509">
    Eli Lilly and Co.
   </company>
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Leveraging funds raised in its IPO and from the purchase by Celgene, the company will fund clinical studies and further development and commercialization of its candidates.
