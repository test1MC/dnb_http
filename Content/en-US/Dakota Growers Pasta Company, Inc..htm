   <em>

   in the noodle market. It is a miller, and producer and marketer of branded and private-label dry pasta products and flours to retail, foodservice, and food ingredient companies in North America. Its mill has an annual capacity to grind 340 thousand tons of durum wheat; production plants can churn out 254 thousand tons of pasta, in more than 150 shapes. The lineup is sold under brand names, including Dreamfields, Pasta Growers, Pasta Sanita, Primo Piatto, and Zia Briosa. Under license, the company distributes Ronzoni, Prince, Creamette, and Mrs. Weiss pasta products to the food service market. Dakota Growers is owned by

   Vertically integrated Dakota Growers combines a durum mill and pasta production facility in North Dakota with a pasta production facility in Minnesota. Durum wheat is purchased and milled into wheat and semolina flours, which are used to make pasta.

        <p>
   The company also buys dry pasta shapes from outside pasta-makers and resells them, thereby beefing up its selection of private label items more efficiently than adding production capacity. Beyond pasta, the wheat and semolina flours, and other flour blends, are sold to food product manufacturers, and lower grade flours and byproducts, to animal feed manufacturers. Dakota Grower's largest customer is

   , accounting for more than 5% sales.

        <p>
   Dakota Growers took root in 1991 as a wheat-farmers cooperative, and restructured as a private corporation in 2002. It became a subsidiary of Viterra eight years later through an all-cash acquisition worth about $240 million.
