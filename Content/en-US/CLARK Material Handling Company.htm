  <p>
   In 1918 CLARK built eight Tructractors (small trucks with front-end loading spaces) to haul materials between various departments of CLARK's axle plant. The company rolled out the first gas-powered forklift truck in 1924. Today, the company has more than 20 brands of lift trucks and other industrial equipment. CLARK also has distribution warehouses in Kentucky and South Korea that supply dealers in more than 80 countries.
