   Flamel Technologies is setting the drug delivery world aflame. The company is using two polymer-based drug delivery systems to develop improved formulations of existing therapies. Its Medusa technology, for injectable drugs, uses an amino-acid polymer to microencapsulate protein peptides and other molecules. Flamel is developing Medusa-enabled versions of long-acting drugs for ailments such as hepatitis C and diabetes. It has also licensed the technology to other drug companies for development of protein drugs. Flamel's second technology, Micropump, is a controlled-release delivery system for small-molecule, orally administered drugs.

   cardiovascular therapy Coreg CR uses the technology.

   In addition to its drug-related work, Flamel has a collaboration agreement with Corning under which it developed polymer photochromic materials for eyeglass lenses. The company earns royalties on sales of the Corning lenses.

   In mid-2016 the company announced plans to merge with and into its Ireland-based Avadel Pharmaceuticals subsidiary, after which it will be headquartered in the tax-friendly and growing pharmaceutical market of Ireland.
