   Sandoz International has been a frontrunner in establishing a presence in the tricky generic biotechnological drug industry; such generic versions of complex pharmaceuticals are often referred to as follow-on biologics or biosimilars and require costly R&amp;D and manufacturing processes. So far, Sandoz, Inc. only offers one generic biotech drug, a recombinant growth hormone called Omnitrope (a follow-on of Somatropin), but it is working to gain FDA approval of additional biologics.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Sandoz organization also regularly develops and launches traditional small molecule generic drugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company received the US approval of Glatopa, the first generic version of Teva's Copaxone (glatiramer acetate injection) 20 mg/ml one-time-daily multiple sclerosis therapy.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Sandoz introduced of its generic dexmedetomidine hydrochloride injection into the US market. This product is a generic version of Hospira's PRECEDEX; decitabine for injection, a generic version of Eisai's DACOGEN.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Sandoz launched 28 new products in the US including authorized generic versions of its Pharmaceuticals Division products Diovan (valsartan), Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate ER) and TOBI (tobramycin inhalation solution, USP); as well as cyclophosphamide injection, USP; calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate ointment (Taclonex, Leo Pharma); adapalene gel (Differin, Galderma Laboratories); lansoprazole capsules, amoxicillin capsules, USP, and clarithromycin tablets, USP (PREVPAC, Takeda Pharmaceuticals); the injectable decitabine (Dacogen, Eisai), and Kerydin (tavaborole) topical solution, 5% after obtaining exclusive rights from Anacor Pharmaceuticals to commercialize it in the US through Sandoz's branded dermatology business, PharmaDerm.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Sandoz also reached an agreement with
   <company id="109576">
    Upsher-Smith
   </company>
   to obtain exclusive US distribution rights for its branded potassium chloride product line, Klor-Con.

  <p>
   In 2012 the firm launched docetaxel injection, the generic version of cancer drug Taxotere, as well as respiratory drug formulations of albuterol sulfate and ipratropium bromide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through its 2012 acquisition of private drugmaker
   <company id="138860">
    Fougera Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   for $1.5 billion, Sandoz became the leading global provider of generic dermatology medicines. The acquisition added manufacturing, R&amp;D, and sales operations in New York, including the PharmaDerm branded generics subsidiary. Following the transaction, Fougera becomes part of the Sandoz Inc. organization, serving as the headquarters for Sandoz's global dermatology business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other purchases include the 2011 acquisition of
   <company id="110384">
    Falcon Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   , the former generic ophthalmic drugmaking unit of
   <company id="89515">
    Alcon
   </company>
   . In 2010 it added respiratory drugs to its development pipeline through the acquisition of US-based Oriel Therapeutics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Formerly named Geneva Pharmaceuticals, the company was brought under the Sandoz name in 2003 as Novartis sought to consolidate its generics businesses. Novartis later acquired
   <company id="105868">
    Eon Labs
   </company>
   in 2005 and integrated it into Sandoz Inc. to further strengthen its position in the US generic pharmaceutical market.
