   Revenues have been strong in recent fiscal years principally due to contributions from acquired businesses, such as World-Check, a provider of financial crime and corruption prevention information. (World-Check assets were eventually transferred to the newly formed Thomson Reuters Financial &amp; Risk business unit, which includes Governance, Risk &amp; Compliance holdings that were previously a part of Thomson Reuters, Legal.) Also that year revenues increased at the company's U.S. Law Firm Solutions, FindLaw, and Elite businesses. Global businesses have also grown, thanks to strong Latin American markets.

  <p>
   The company traces its roots to John West, who began selling law treatises, dictionaries, and legal forms in 1872 in St. Paul, Minnesota. Four years later, John's brother Horatio joined him in publishing a weekly newspaper containing excerpts from the Minnesota courts. The firm began publishing law textbooks in 1910. In 1968 Dwight Opperman took control of West Publishing, which had passed through several hands. In 1973 it published its first college textbooks, and in 1975 it introduced Westlaw.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thomson bought West for $3.4 billion in 1996 and merged it with its legal publishing unit. Brian Hall (president of Thomson Legal since 1995) remained head of the newly merged legal publishing unit, which was renamed West Group in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 West Group launched an online version of its Westlaw research service. The next year, West Group launched Lawoffice.com, a "one-stop" Internet site for legal information. Also that year, the
   <company id="151183">
    US Supreme Court
   </company>
   refused to review decisions denying West Group copyright protection for its citation system.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 it launched WestWorks, a Web tool that allows lawyers to integrate tasks such as billing and case management. (Poor sales led the company to stop selling WestWorks in 2001.) The firm bought Findlaw, an online legal information site, in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 West broadened its content with new databases devoted to homeland security and terrorism. That year the company acquired Pennsylvania-based Andrews Publications and LA-based Elite Information Group. The company later changed its name to Thomson West.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company expanded with the acquisitions of Global Securities Information (GSI), Netscan iPublishing, and Hildebrandt International. The following year it purchased LiveNote, a provider of real-time transcript, document, and evidence management software and services. And in 2007 the company added to its holdings Baker Robbins &amp; Company, a provider of technology and information management consulting to law firms and corporate law departments. In 2008 Thomson acquired Reuters, creating new parent company Thomson Reuters. The company subsequently became Thomson Reuters, Legal.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company made several acquisitions in 2010, including document review software firm CaseLogistix in 2010. CaseLogistix provides document tools that help litigation teams manage the electronic discovery review process; the addition helped the Legal business expand its Litigator set of offerings. Other 2010 acquisitions include
