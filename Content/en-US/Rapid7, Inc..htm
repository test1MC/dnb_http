   Cybersecurity attacks threaten companies at a rapid-fire pace. Rapid7 responds in kind. The company's products assess and analyze corporate networks, detect intrusions, and root them out. The company's cloud-based Rapid7 Insight Platform provides customers with a wide view of systems and threats as well as detailed information about users and where vulnerabilities lurk. Rapid7 calls its approach a new model that employs analytics to reduce and manage risks across a system instead of a front-loaded 'block-and-protect' style. Most the company's sales are in the US. Rapid7 was named after a New York City express train that the founders rode to work in the company's early days.

  <p>
   Rapid7's cloud-based products help its customers assess their vulnerabilities, detect and respond to attacks, and gather and analyze security-related data across a network. The company also provides consulting on security issues. Its products include Nexpose, Metasploit, and AppSpider for managing threat exposure; InsightUBA and InsightID for detection and response; and Logentries for data collection and analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rapid7 gets revenue from sales of products, maintenance and support, and professional services. Products account for about 58% of revenue, with maintenance and support generating 24%, and professional services supplying 18%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company runs its cloud-based software on third-party data centers in Boston, Massachusetts. Infrastructure of its InsightIDR, InsightUBA, and Logentries products are on Amazon Web Services. Rapid7 also operates its own network infrastructure for some tasks.

  <p>
   Rapid7's rapidly growing sales are handled by its inside and field sales staffs. The sales people work in specific geographic regions and according to customer size. The company also leverages channel partners for other sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Large company customers generated 58% of Rapid7's sales with the rest coming from mid-market companies. Rapid7's customers are in technology, energy, financial services, healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing, media and entertainment, retail, and other industries.

   Like many companies with hot products in a hot market, Rapid7's sales are rising quickly. The company's revenue reached $110.5 million in 2015 from $76.8 million in 2014, and $60 million in 2013. Revenue comes from a mix of current customers that buy more products and from new customers. Focused on selling software and gaining market share, Rapid7 has lost money as it spends on research and development and marketing. It lost about $50 million in 2015, compared to a loss of $32.6 million in 2014. Its negative cash flow fell to $1.9 million in 2015 from $3.4 million in 2014.

  <p>
   Rapid7 follows the playbook of fast-growing tech companies: build out the product portfolio and expand the customer base and spend what it takes to do both.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the product side, Rapid7's research and development spending rose to $38.7 million in 2015 from $25 million in 2014. Then in 2016 the company rolled out InsightIDR, a comprehensive incident detection and response product. The product contains elements of Rapid7 research and technology from an acquisition.
  </p>
  <p>
   For sales and marketing, Rapid7's spending jumped to $67 million in 2015 from $49 million in 2014. That led to a 39% increase in sales and marketing headcount.
