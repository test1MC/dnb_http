   ShoreTel's revenue held steady at about $360 million in 2016 (ended June) compared to 2015. Product revenue dropped 23% on reduced demand for premise-based systems from new customers, which, the company said, is an industry trend. That drop was somewhat balanced by increases in hosted (cloud) services services (up 20%) and support and service (up 3%). The growth came from new customers as well as current customers switching to hosted services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Increases in research and development, sales and marketing, and administrative costs nudged the company's net loss to about $5 million in 2016, about $1 million higher than 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operations dipped to $35 million in 2016 from $41 million in 2015. More cash coming in from an increase in deferred revenue and decreases in accounts receivable and inventory was offset by decreases in accrued taxes and surcharges and accounts payable.

  <p>
   ShoreTel is on the move to two destinations where, it hopes, sales await. The company is in the midst of shifting its products -- and its customers -- to the cloud. And it is pushing expansion to international markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has lost sales of its on-premises products but gained sales of its hosted cloud products. A key part of its cloud strategy is to switch its base of on-premise customers to cloud services. Already a number of its on-premise customers have agreed to move or have moved to ShoreTel's cloud services or added them to their setups. The company estimates that recurring revenue from cloud services should account for nearly two-thirds of its total in 2017, up from 40% in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   ShoreTel has established a presence in the UK for entree into Europe and in Australia as a base for the Asia/Pacific market. It also has added offices in Canada. The company plans to push its cloud communications products and services in the new markets.

  <p>
   ShoreTel's acquisition of Corvisa in 2016 for some $8 million, should help its push to the cloud and overseas markets. Corvisa provides cloud-based software for call centers and has an active international sales component.
