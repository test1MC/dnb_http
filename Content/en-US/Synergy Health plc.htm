   Synergy Health syncs good hygiene and medical care. The firm provides outsourced medical and surgical support services to hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care providers in the UK and abroad. Its Healthcare Solutions division helps control infections by providing hand sanitation and cleaning supply services, as well as pathology laboratory services. The company's Hospital Sterilization unit is a leading provider of surgical instrument decontamination and sterilization services to the

   . In addition, the Applied Sterilization division provides irradiation treatments and ethylene oxide sterilization. Surgical equipment firm

  <p>
   In 2014 US-based hospital sterilization equipment company STERIS paid about $2 billion for Synergy. The combination created a global enterprise serving medical device manufacturers and hospitals in more than 60 countries. It also allows STERIS to avoid US corporate taxes by having its headquarters in the UK.

  <p>
   Synergy operates through three segments -- Applied Sterilisation Technologies (AST), Healthcare Services (HS), and Healthcare Solutions (HCS). AST sterilization techniques include gamma irradiation, electron and ion beam irradiation, and ethylene oxide sterilization. It primarily serves customers in the medical, pharmaceutical, and biologics markets, including several multinational medical device manufacturers. AST also provides consultancy services and logistics support.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, HS provides medical and surgical equipment sterilization to hospitals, private care facilities, dentistry practices, and orthopedic loan set suppliers.

  <p>
   Following a strategy of international expansion, Synergy has moved across Europe and into Asia and the Middle East. It operates from more than 40 sites in the core UK and Ireland markets, which account for more than half of annual revenues. Synergy has 50 additional locations within its Europe/Middle East segment (in Germany, France, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the United Arab Emirates), as well as select locations in Asia and the US. All told, the firm has more than 100 sterilization, sales, and service sites in 16 countries, with distribution operations in additional regions.

  <p>
   Synergy's revenues increased 7% in fiscal 2015 to £408.8 million as AST and HS earnings rose; this growth was driven by the initiation of new contracts, but was partially offset by decreased earnings from the HS segment. Net income decreased 1% to £33.6 million that year due to increased expenses. Cash flow from operations rose 1% to £85.9 million.

  <p>
   The company plans to continue its growth by making selective acquisitions, pursuing geographical expansion, and accessing other health-related areas. Synergy is working especially hard to widen its international presence by purchasing or building new facilities. At the same time, Synergy regularly evaluates its portfolio and occasionally divests redundant or underperforming facilities. In 2016, HS sold its linen management services business to STAR Mayan Limited.

  <p>
   Due to its size, Synergy is able to take advantage of global scale when delivering its services. It has niche services in its sights, as they have higher barriers to entry, affording it with competitive advantages. In 2014 the company announced plans to invest £18 million in its AST division, a figure it expects to nearly double in increased revenues over the next three years.

  <p>
   In 2014 Synergy acquired Bioster for £23.6 million. Bioster operates ethylene oxide and electron beam sterilization facilities in Italy, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic; the acquisition boosts AST's existing facilities in Europe.
