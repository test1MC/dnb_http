   Insys Therapeutics aims to take the rough edges off of chemo and cancer pain. The commercial-stage drug development company is focused on treating side effects of chemotherapy, as well as therapies for pain management. Its first product is Subsys, which brings in virtually all of its revenue; it is a fast-acting oral spray version of cancer pain drug Fentanyl. Syndros (dronabinol), which was approved by the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   in mid-2016, is a generic liquid formulation of Marinol (a synthetic version of the active chemical in marijuana) for treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. All of the company's drug candidates are re-formulations of already-approved therapeutic ingredients.

  <p>
   In addition to its two marketed products, Insys has a pipeline of pain management, depression, drug dependence, and nausea prevention treatments under development. These include LEP-ETU, a reformulation of cancer drug paclitaxel; and opioid dependence treatment Buprenorphine Naloxone Sublingual Spray.

   Subsys is marketed by a US-based sales force. It is primarily sold to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors including Rochester Drug Cooperative (32% of Subsys sales in 2015),
   <company id="40016">

   (20%),

    McKesson

   (17%), and

   (14%).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Insys spent $1.1 million on advertising, up from $0.8 million in 2014 and $0.6 million in 2013.

  <p>
   Insys' revenues have been rising since 2012 as sales of Subsys have risen. In 2015, net sales increased 49% to $330.8 million; this was led by a 30% increase in Subsys shipments and a 20% increase in the drug's price. The higher Subsys revenue was partially offset by decreased revenue from the Dronabinol SG capsule, a drug that the company distributed in partnership with

    Mylan
   </company>
   until 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has fluctuated over the past few years. It rose 54% to $58.5 million in 2015 thanks to the higher Subsys sales (but partially offset by higher sales and marketing expenses). Cash flow from operations doubled to $100.8 million that year, largely due to the higher net income.

  <p>
   Insys is focused on marketing Subsys and Syndros, as well as getting approval for other products including its Naloxone Sublinqual Spray for the treatment of opioid overdose. The company also stands to benefit from the growing medical marijuana market, which has increasingly come into the mainstream as more states legalize the drug.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the company has come under fire for its Subsys marketing practices (it is under investigation for pushing Subsys use for non-approved indications), particularly in light of the growing opioid overdose epidemic. Fentanyl use, often in combination with heroin, has skyrocketed across the US, resulting in thousands of overdose deaths.
