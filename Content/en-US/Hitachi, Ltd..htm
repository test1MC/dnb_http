   Hitachi, which means "risen sun," is looking for a new dawn of profits from its galaxy of businesses. The company's Information &amp; Telecommunications Systems (semiconductors, servers, mainframes, ATMs) brings in the most revenue, followed by Social Infrastructure (elevators, escalators, industrial machinery) and High Functional Materials (wire, cables, specialty steel, circuit boards). Its Electronic Systems &amp; Equipment segment includes specialized manufacturing equipment and power tools. The company is a world leader in consumer goods ranging from TVs to washing machines and in power generation equipment. Hitachi also has operations in financial services, automotive systems, and construction machinery.

  <p>
   Hitachi's revenue streams are fairly diversified with no one segment accounting for more than 20%. The Information and Telecommunications segment generates 19% of revenue, followed by Social Infrastructure and Industrial Systems (which includes railway equipment, elevators,and water treatment systems) at 15%, High Functional Materials and Components, 14%, Electronic Systems and Equipment, 11%, and Automotive Systems, 9%.

  <p>
   More than 50% of revenue originates in Hitachi's home country, Japan. Customers in neighboring Asia countries buy 23% of the company's products while 11% of revenue comes from North American customers.

  <p>
   Hitachi's revenue rose 2% in 2015 (ended March) from 2014. Sales in the Social Infrastructure and Industrial unit were about 10% higher on rising elevator and escalator sales in China. Net income slid about 9% because of taxes and a loss from discontinued operations. Cash flow from operations increased 2% in 2015.

  <p>
   Hitachi is shifting from recovery to growth mode, putting a hefty Â¥335 billion into research and development conducted in centers in Japan and overseas. The company targets China and North America, particularly the US, for growth. In China, Hitachi planned to build a manufacturing facility to turn out automotive equipment. Looking beyond the China market, the plan can meet automotive specifications for customers in other parts of the world.

  <p>
   Depending too much on China (10% of revenue) with its unstable economy can be tricky for Hitachi as well as other companies. If the Chinese economy continues to show signs of instability, competition could get fierce as more companies chase less business. In the US, Hitachi targets growth in automotive and IT equipment and services.

  <p>
   The company bought Waupaca Foundry, based in Waupaca, Wisconsin, in late 2014. The company, the world's largest producer of ductile iron and gray iron castings, became part of Hitachi Metals. The acquisition brings complementary capabilities to Hitachi for the automotive, commercial vehicle, and off-highway markets.

  <p>
   Namihei Odaira, an employee of Kuhara Mining in the Japanese coastal city of Hitachi, wanted to prove that Japan did not have to depend on foreigners for technology. In 1910 he began building electric motors in Kuhara's engineering and repair shop. Japanese power companies were forced to buy Odaira's generators when WWI made imports scarce. Impressed, they reordered, and in 1920 Hitachi (meaning "risen sun") became an independent company.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1920s acquisitions and growth turned Hitachi into a major manufacturer of electrical equipment and machinery. In the 1930s and 1940s, Hitachi developed vacuum tubes and light bulbs and produced radar and sonar for the Japanese war effort. Postwar occupation forces removed Odaira and closed 19 Hitachi plants. Reeling from the plant closures, war damage, and labor strife, Hitachi was saved from bankruptcy by US military contracts during the Korean War.

   In the 1950s Hitachi became a supplier to

    Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
   </company>
   (NTT), the state-owned telecommunications monopoly. Japan's economic recovery led to strong demand for the company's communications and electrical equipment. Hitachi began mass-producing home appliances, radios, TVs, and transistors. The group spun off

   and
   <company id="119606">
    Hitachi Cable

    Hitachi Chemical

   in 1963.
