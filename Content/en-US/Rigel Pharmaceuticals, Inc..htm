   When immune systems attack, Rigel Pharmaceuticals wants to be there. The drug discovery and development firm focuses its research and development efforts on inflammatory/autoimmune, muscle, and immuno-oncology-related diseases. Drugs in development include candidates for treating rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, muscle wasting, multiple sclerosis, and transplant rejection. Rigel Pharmaceuticals prefers to collaborate with larger pharmaceutical companies in the development of its drug candidates. The company has more than 90 pending patent applications and more than 230 issued patents in the US, as well as corresponding pending foreign patent applications and issued foreign patents.

  <p>
   Rigel's primary candidate in development is fostamatinib, an oral spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor in phase III trials for immune thrombocytopenic purpura and in phase II trials for IgA nephropathy. Other candidates include R348, a topical SYK and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor in phase II trials for the treatment of chronic dry eye; and two oncology candidates in phase I development with BerGenBio and
   <company id="140780">
    Daiichi Sankyo
   </company>
   .Preclinical programs include R256 for asthma (with
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   ) and TGF beta inhibitors for immuno-oncology (with
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Myers Squibb
   </company>
   ).

   In 2014,
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   accounted for 100% of the company's revenues.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Revenue rose 15% to $8.3 million in 2014 on higher contract revenues from collaborations. Those consisted of $5.8 million associated with non-refundable time-based payments earned and $2.5 million from AstraZeneca for the continued development of R256 for asthma.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has reported net losses every year since its inception except for in 2010, when it received a one-time upfront payment from AstraZeneca. In 2014, net loss increased 2% to $91 million due to lower interest earnings and a loss on its sublease of property. As of December 31, 2014, Rigel had accumulated debt of approximately $940.2 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow decreased 19% to $69 million in 2014.

   Rigel focuses on developing and commercializing selected candidates, developing a diverse pipeline, and establishing collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotech companies. At the end of 2014 the company had not yet started commercializing its products. Rigel is working on developing FosD, an oral SYK inhibitor in clinical trials for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rigel is also collaborating with
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   on a early stage candidate to treat asthma. Such partnerships are structured so that Rigel takes compounds through the early stages of discovery and development, and then hands them over to the larger collaborator to fund and conduct the later stages of development, approval, and commercialization. Along the way, its collaborators make milestone payments and, ultimately, royalties on product sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also has an agreement with Daiichi Sanko to develop a novel class of drugs that target cancer cell proliferation through protein degradation. Daiichi paid Rigel about $1 million upfront in the deal and Daiichi is eligible for several different milestone payments, depending upon the drug's success. In 2015 Rigel entered into a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb for the discovery, development, and commercialization of cancer immunotherapies; Bristol-Myers Squibb will pay an upfront payment of $30 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2015, the company initiated a phase II clinical trial of fostamatinib in patients with IgAN (a chronic autoimmune disease of the kidneys). It expects to report results on the trials in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   After phase I clinical trials of Rigel's R118 resulted in negative side effects, the company discontinued its indirect AMPK activator program. It is still conducting research on the direct AMPK activator research program.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to focus its efforts on commercializing fostamatinib, the company cut 38% of its workforce in mid-2016. Its smaller research department continues to explore treatments in immunology and oncology.
