   Pixelworks' chips put the sizzle in digital displays. The company's display controller integrated circuits (ICs) power visual displays in PCs, TVs, and other electronic devices. Its ImageProcessor system-on-chip ICs combine microprocessor, memory, software, and digital signal processor components onto a single device. Distributor Tokyo Electron Device (TED) accounts for about 44% of sales; distributors are behind more than 60% of Pixelworks' sales. Other customers include
   <company id="41882">
    SANYO Electric
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="55160">
    Seiko Epson
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41866">
    Hitachi
   </company>
   , which each account for 10% of sales. About 90% of the company's sales come from customers in Asia, primarily Japan.

   Founded in 1997, Pixelworks expanded its Asian presence through its acquisition of nDSP Corp., a California-based maker of video processing ICs that had engineering centers in China, in 2002. Also that year Pixelworks expanded its product lines through its acquisition of Jaldi Semiconductor, a maker of video processor ICs for the HDTV market.

   In 2003 Pixelworks agreed to combine with rival
   <company id="57705">
    Genesis Microchip
   </company>
   in a $600 million deal to form an enterprise tentatively named Genesis Pixelworks, but the two companies later called off the transaction. Genesis Microchip was acquired by
   <company id="42481">
    STMicroelectronics
   </company>
   in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adding Internet protocol television (IPTV) chips to its line in 2005, Pixelworks acquired
   <company id="60932">
    Equator Technologies
   </company>
   for about $108 million in cash, plus the assumption of stock options valued at around $8 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Failing to post an annual profit in six out of the previous eight years, Pixelworks repeatedly restructured its operations in 2006, cutting costs to get closer to breakeven. The fabless company consolidated North American operations, among other measures.
