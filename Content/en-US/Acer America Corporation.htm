    Dell
   </company>

   In keeping with the broader market trend toward smaller laptop computers and other mobile devices, Acer has expanded its portable PC line to include slimmed-down netbook computers for customers who mainly need an affordable device for accessing the Web and sending email. The roll-out of a line of tablet PC's in 2011 extended the company's focus on the booming mobile Internet and computing space.
