   A significant percentage of the company's revenue comes from only a handful of customers. These customers include
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="103975">
    Siemens Energy
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="110604">
    Southern Nuclear Operating Company
   </company>
   , and the
   <company id="40460">
    Tennessee Valley Authority
   </company>
   , each of which accounted for around 15% of the company's total revenue in 2014 (a total of 60%).

  <p>
   Global Power's revenue has grown the last few years, climbing 11% from $484 million in 2013 to $539 million in 2014. The growth was fueled by a 72% surge in Energy Services sales and a 8% spike from Product Solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income fell 5% from $12 million in 2013 to $11 million in 2014 due to higher operating and acquisition-related expenses. In addition, its operating cash flow has fluctuated wildly the last few years; it experienced negative cash flow two out of the last three years.

  <p>
   Global Power is expecting growth in its services division as aging plants, including nuclear power plants built decades ago, seek to upgrade and modernize their facilities. Global Power is also confident that demand for its gas turbine and other equipment will increase as the anticipated recovery in the natural gas industry -- evident in increased gas exploration and production activity -- takes hold in coming years.

  <p>
   To support its growth strategy, the company has made acquisitions to bolster its product and service offerings. In 2013 the company acquired Hetsco, which provides brazed aluminum heat exchanger maintenance and repair services, for $32.5 million. Hetsco is part of the company's services division.

   In 2015 Global Power acquired
