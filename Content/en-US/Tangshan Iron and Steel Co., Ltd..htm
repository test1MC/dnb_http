   Tangshan Iron &amp; Steel is among China's largest steel companies and is in the process of getting even larger. The company's products include wire rods, hot-rolled steel sheets, and twisted steel bars. In addition, its four subsidiaries conduct mining exploration and make aluminum zinc alloys. Tangshan is 60%-controlled by the Chinese government, which pushed forward the country's steel industry consolidation in 2008 by combining Tangshan with
