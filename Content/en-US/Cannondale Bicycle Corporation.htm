   Cannondale's lightweight products are heavyweights in the high-performance bicycle market. The company is a leading maker of mountain, road racing, multisport, recreational, and specialty bicycles -- most of them with aluminum frames. Cannondale also peddles bicycle-related apparel, accessories, and gear. The bicycle maker offers some 80 bike models through specialty bike retailers in about 70 countries. It also co-sponsors bike-racing teams to promote its products. The company boasts major facilities in Japan and Taiwan. Cannondale is owned by juvenile products and bicycle company

   Cannondale sells its bicycles through mass merchants, which have captured a greater share of the bicycle market over the past 20 years and account for more than 70% of unit sales today, and independent bike dealers (IBD). IBD retailers specialize in higher-end bicycles with prices reaching more than $10,000. Sporting goods chains specialize in the mid-price range and in the US account for less than 10% of total industry retail sales.

   Strong sales at Cannondale helped propel Dorel's Recreational/Leisure segment to $928 million in sales in 2012, an 8% increase versus 2011.

   Dorel is investing to build value and long-term growth of its key bicycle brands, including Cannondale, Schwinn, GT, and Mongoose. Cannondale is working to boost its presence in pro cycling. To that end, in 2012 the company became Title Sponsor of newly-named Cannondale Pro Cycling Team, which has helped to boost sales of the brand, particularly in Europe where racing is popular. Also, the company entered the premium market for bicycles in China in mid-2012. New cycles, including the Cannondale F-series, the Cannondale Scalpel 2ger, and the Cannondale SuperSix EVO, are helping to propel sales.

        <p>
   Farm boy Joe Montgomery quit college three times, sailed charter boats for a living until sinking in shark-infested waters, and then became a Wall Street analyst. He left high finance in 1970 and started what became Cannondale in 1971. His first office in an old pickle factory near the Cannondale, Connecticut, train stop inspired the company's name.
  </p>
        <p>
   Cannondale began by making bike trailers. The company added bike clothing and bags that were picked up by the
   <company id="40271">

   </company>
   catalog, providing Montgomery with the capital to begin making aluminum-frame bikes. Cannondale introduced one of the first affordable aluminum-frame bicycles in 1983 and added mountain bikes the next year. In 1988 a complete overhaul of its manufacturing process increased productivity 240%, helping the company become a worldwide industry player. Cannondale went public in 1994.
  </p>
        <p>
   Battling a soft bicycle market, in 1998 Cannondale stepped up production of its CODA line of components -- gears, brakes, wheel hubs, and forks. The company also began making a bigger push into the European market, where biking was more popular than in the US. Cannondale put on hold its plans to enter the wheelchair market. (Montgomery became interested in wheelchair design when he began making them at home for his son Michael, a wheelchair athlete.)
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1999 the company introduced the MX400 off-road motorcycle, its first motorized product. In 2000 Cannondale introduced its first all-terrain vehicle. In 2003 it sold off all of the intellectual property of its suffering motorsports division. Also that year founder, chairman, president, and CEO Joseph Montgomery left the company after Pegasus Capital Advisors purchased all of Cannondale's assets.
  </p>
        <p>
   Pegasus eventually sold Cannondale to Dorel Industries, which was looking to boost its bicycle operations as owner of Pacific Cycle.
  </p>
        <p>
   In September 2008 Matt Mannelly, president and CEO, left the company and Dorel's Jeff Frehner, president and CEO of the Cannondale Sports Group, took his place.
