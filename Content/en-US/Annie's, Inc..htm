   While doing what it loves, Annie's also wouldn't mind taking a bite out of
   <company id="55825">
    Kraft
   </company>
   's business. An organic and natural food producer, Annie's makes about 145 products consisting of pastas, cereals, dressings, condiments, and snacks through its Annie's Homegrown and Annie's Naturals units. Annie's Homegrown banner includes boxed organic macaroni and cheese, breakfast cereals (Cinna Bunnies), fruit snacks (Bunny Fruit), organic granola bars, and organic ready meals. Under the Annie's Naturals name, the company offers organic and natural salad dressings, condiments (marinades, sauces, mustard, ketchup), and olive oil. Founded in 1989, Annie's was acquired by

   for about $820 million.

   Cereal giant

   in October 2014 paid $46 per share in cash to buy Annie's from its private equity owner
   <company id="61147">
    Solera Capital
   </company>
   . The offer represented a 51% premium over the stock's trading price at the time. The sale will allow Annie's, which retained its California headquarters, to grow more quickly and extend is brand by capitalizing on General Mill's supply chain capabilities and marketing might.

   Annie's went public in March 2012 with an offering worth $95 million. The natural foods maker used proceeds from going public for working capital and general corporate purposes that likely included product innovation and development, among other initiatives.

   The US is a core market for California-based Annie's, accounting for more than 95% of revenue; Canada generates the rest.

   Annie's sells its products through three primary channels: mainstream grocery, natural retailer, and mass merchandiser/other. In 2014 United Natural Foods, Annie's largest distributor, generated 22% of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its primary customer wants food made without the use of artificial flavors, synthetic colors, and preservatives.
  </p>
  <p>
   The food firm generally spends about a $1 million each year on advertising expenses. It spent $1.5 million in 2014 and $900,000 and $1.2 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.

  <p>
   Annie's chases after the world's largest organic food market -- the US -- where the company generates the vast majority of its revenue. The company's strategy of targeting this niche of the vast food market has been paying off. Since 2007 Annie's has logged growth in both sales and profit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among the natural and organic market, Annie's holds the #1 spot in four product lines: macaroni and cheese, snack crackers, fruit snacks, and graham crackers.
  </p>
  <p>
   For more elbow room and to accommodate the company's larger products portfolio, Annie's moved into new corporate digs in 2011. The company entered a lease agreement to rent 34,000 sq. ft. of office space in hip hotbead Berkeley, California. The move was necessitated by Annie's increased product selection and expanded distribution. Since opening its former office in Napa, the natural foods maker had reached $100 million in sales annually. Annie's office, where it also conducts research and development, boasts a 4,000-sq.-ft. organic garden and green space.
  </p>
  <p>
   Annie's plans to enter new product categories while it expands its fast-growing snack and pasta products. Such recent introductions include Organic Granola Bars, Organic Pretzel Bunnies, and Gingersnap and SnickerDoodle Gluten-Free Bunny Cookies. Other initiatives include reducing sodium in its products by another 15% during the next five years, sourcing all milk ingredients from cows not treated with synthetic growth hormones to be rBST-free, reformulating its products that have cocoa so that the taste is milder, and offering its customers more organic products. Annie's Organic Bunny Fruit Snacks (the company's version of
   <company id="102562">
    gummy bears
   </company>
   ) have proven to be the company's most successful new product launch ever.
