   Fujitec America's products include gearless and geared elevators, machine roomless elevators, and architectural products (including elevator cabs and ceilings, car operating panels, hall indicators, in-car indicator, hall lanterns, hall button stations, and LCD screens). It makes its Millennium geared and gearless elevators for medium to high-rise buildings. Talon brand roomless elevators employ drive pulleys which are connected to the permanent magnet motor, a technology totally different from conventional hoist machines. Fujitec America designed a "smart" elevator for use in Seattle's Metropolitan Park West Tower. The technology lets passengers enter their destination floor, and the system then processes the requested floors and informs waiting passengers which elevator car to enter. It is designed to avoid the wait and rush to get in the next available elevator.

   Suffering from reduced demand for heavy-duty elevators and escalators, the company scaled back its operations and sold its 180,000 square-foot facility in Lebanon, Ohio. It financed a smaller and more technologically advanced facility in Mason, Ohio, where it took up residence in 2008.
