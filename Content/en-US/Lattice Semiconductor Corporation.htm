   The garden that grows on this Lattice is made up of silicon. Lattice Semiconductor is a top developer of programmable logic devices (PLDs). Lattice also makes low-density logic devices and sells software used to customize its chips, which are used in communications, computing, industrial, military, consumer, and automotive applications. The fabless chipmaker has expanded into the market for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), another type of programmable chip. The majority of sales come from Asia.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Lattice categorizes its products according to how advanced their technology is. The company's newest, most advance chips account for 48% of revenue while its mainstream chips account for 39%. Its mature chip segment generates 33% of revenue. As one might hope, the newest chips grew the most for the year with sales up 16%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The fabless semiconductor company uses contract manufacturers to produce its wafers.
   <company id="159600">
    Fujitsu Semiconductor
   </company>
   makes most of the company's new products. Other chip makers that produce devices for Lattice on a contract basis include
   <company id="43493">
    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="55160">
    Seiko Epson Corp.

   , and
   <company id="55908">
    United Microelectronics

  <p>
   Lattice Semiconductor continues to conduct most of its product development work in the US, through facilities in California and Oregon. It also has development centers in China, India, and the Philippines, and operational centers in the Philippines and Singapore.
  </p>
  <p>
   More than 90% of its sales, however, are to customers overseas. China is its top market, accounting for 43% of revenue. Customers in other Asian countries provide 19% of sales while European customers are responsible for 16%. Sales to US customers account for 8% of Lattice's revenue.

   Lattice Semiconductor sells primarily through distributors:
   <company id="10130">
    Arrow Electronics
   </company>
   and its
   <company id="12193">
    Nu Horizons Electronics
   </company>
   subsidiary combined account for a quarter of sales. Taiwan-based wholesaler
   <company id="177726">
    Weikeng
   </company>
   accounts for another 10%. It also sells directly through a network of sales representatives, and uses direct sales management and a field applications engineering organization to provide end-user and indirect sales support.

  <p>
   Year-over-year sales in 2014 rose 10% to $366 million. Stronger sales of its ECP3 products  to a 21% increase in revenue from the communications market. Use of Lattice chip in the build out of China's communications infrastructure also contributed. Consumer revenue fell 8% with reduced demand for iCE40 products from a major OEM.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lattice's net income more than doubled in 2014 to $48.5 million from $22 million in 2013. The increased revenue covered higher costs in selling and general expenses and in research and development spending.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations fell to $40 million in 2014 from $56.5 million in 2013.

  <p>
   Lattice expanded its product line beyond its programmable chips with its acquisition of
   <company id="60652">
    Silicon Image
   </company>
   for more than $600 million in 2015. The company expects that the combination of its programmable chips and Silicon Image's static chips can be a strong lure for customers particularly in consumer and industrial markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lattice also has taken steps to shore ups it finances and expenses. It sold its headquarters facility in Hillsboro, Oregon and moved the HQ to a leased space in downtown Portland.

  <p>
   The Silicon Image acquisition was partly financed with $350 million in debt. The deal expands Lattice's product line and its customer base.

  <p>
   Lattice Semiconductor was founded in 1983 by Rahul Sud, who quit his job at
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   to start the company. In 1985 Lattice introduced programmable logic devices (PLDs) that employed its pioneering electronically erasable CMOS technology. Losses led Lattice to file for Chapter 11 in 1987. A year later the company brought in Cyrus Tsui, who was then general manager of the programmable logic division of Monolithic Memories (now part of
   <company id="10037">
    Advanced Micro Devices
   </company>
   ), as CEO to turn things around. Tsui became chairman in 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 the company debuted its in-system programmable (ISP) technology. Lattice invested $60 million with Taiwan's
   <company id="55908">
    United Microelectronics
   </company>
   for a new chip plant in 1995. In 1997 the company teamed up with
   <company id="55160">
    Seiko Epson
   </company>
   , another silicon foundry contractor, to build a new wafer fabrication facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought Vantis (created in 1996 from AMD's PLD operations) in 1999 for $500 million. The next year Lattice released its next-generation BFW (big, fast, wide) PLD line -- part of a wave of a company-record 35 new products for the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2002 the company acquired the FPGA business of
   <company id="102887">
    Agere Systems
   </company>
   for $250 million in cash. Later that year Lattice acquired privately held Cerdelinx Technologies, which designed high-speed input/output devices, for about $25 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lattice Semiconductor extended its distribution relationship with
   <company id="119148">
    Eurodis Electron
   </company>
   in 2004 to the Scandinavian countries, the UK, and Ireland. Also that year the company extended and expanded its OEM relationship with
   <company id="14078">
    Mentor Graphics
   </company>
   to supply software used in designing Lattice chips.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cyrus Tsui was placed on paid leave in mid-2005, as the board's audit committee examined issues related to executive compensation and internal controls. Rodney Sloss, the VP of finance, was placed on paid leave, as well. Both executives were fired in August 2005. The board forwarded the findings of its audit committee to the
   <company id="56705">
    Securities and Exchange Commission
   </company>
   , which was conducting an informal inquiry into Lattice.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under new management in late 2005, Lattice initiated a corporate restructuring that included a reduction in force of 12%-14%, more than 100 employees. The company shuttered three R&amp;D sites in the US and one in the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lattice reached a settlement in early 2007 with the SEC on the stock options and compensation issue, with the company agreeing to a cease-and-desist order.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008, as the global economic downturn hit a chip industry already in a down cycle, Lattice restructured, including layoff of about 125 employees, a reduction in force of around 14%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Faced with lower sales a weak global economy, in 2009 Lattice Semiconductor again moved to reduce costs. The company moved its warehouse from Oregon to Singapore, in order to lower shipping and fulfillment costs and reduce inventory on hand. It also laid off another 8% of its workforce. Late in the year, the company announced yet another restructuring plan including another round of layoffs and establishment of an operations center in Singapore.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 CEO Bruno Guilmart resigned from all positions with Lattice Semiconductor. Darin Billerbeck -- a technology industry veteran with 30 years of experience working for the likes of
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10037">
    AMD
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="13211">
    ZiLOG
   </company>
   -- replaced Guilmart shortly after the resignation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Lattice Semiconductor restructured for the third time in four years. In the cost cutting effort, the company reduced headcount and refocused its workforce at R&amp;D facilities in Pennsylvania and China and streamlined supply chain activities at its corporate headquarters. It also extended certain silicon development capabilities, along with planning and logistics activities, to the Philippines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2011, Lattice Semiconductor acquired Hong Kong-based Rise Technology Development Company and its Philippines-based subsidiary APAC IC Layout Consultants. The purchase of Rise and APAC IC added a development center in the Philippines and new engineering layout and design capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Lattice Semiconductor acquired SiliconBlue Technologies, which provides FPGA devices for the consumer handheld industry, for about $62 million.
