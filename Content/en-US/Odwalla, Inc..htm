   It isn't odd to drink beverages made from fruits and vegetables, it's Odwalla (pronounced ode-wall-ah). The company's juice beverages are known for their colorful packaging and equally colorful names, including Mo' Beta, Pink Poetry, and Wholly Grain! Odwalla works to develop new beverages, such as PomaGrand and Protein Monster, to stay popular with both foodies and moms alike. The beverage producer also makes nutritional bars and soy-based drinks, including organic soy milk. The company's fruit juices, protein drinks, and food bars are sold through natural food stores, club stores, supermarkets, and specialty outlets in the US. Odwalla is a unit of

   Headquartered in California, Odwalla operates nationwide, supported by its parent's 280 principal beverage distribution warehouses.

   Odwalla operates as part of behemoth beverage maker's
   <company id="112373">
    Coca-Cola North America
   </company>
   unit, which in fiscal 2013 generated some 45% of its parent company's revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its parent's reorganization, Odwalla in 2013 moved its headquarters to join Coca-Cola North America's corporate arm and production facility in Dinuba, California.

  <p>
   While parent Coca-Cola North America does not break out separate financials for Odwalla, the regional segment has reported that in fiscal 2013 its growth rates were impacted by sales volume, structural changes, price and product/geographic mix, and foreign currency fluctuations.

   To keep its portfolio of products fresh, Odwalla regularly rolls out new items. The company in 2013 introduced a new line of food bars that incorporate whole grains made specifically for kids. Under the Odwalla Bars for Kids name, they come in several flavors, including Chocolate Chip Kick, Strawberry Score, and Banana Dunk.
  </p>
  <p>
   Odwalla's single-serve products represent about 80% of its business. As part of Coca-Cola's push to double the circulation of environmentally friendly packaging, the company began making beverages in bottles made from plants. The new bottles, which are composed of petroleum-based materials with up to 30% plant-based materials, are made by turning sugar cane and molasses into a component for the plastics; they also have the same shelf life as its existing bottles.

  <p>
   Greg Steltenpohl and two friends (one of whom he married) formed Odwalla in 1980, selling freshly squeezed orange juice to Santa Cruz, California, restaurants in part to raise money for musical events in local schools. Oozing social and environmental responsibility, Odwalla expanded into retail distribution and in 1993 went public. Buying two local juice companies helped it expand into the Pacific Northwest and Colorado.
  </p>
  <p>
   Odwalla's bright graphics, playful product names, and unpasteurized juices freshly wrung from fruits and vegetables proved popular with natural foods consumers. However, unpasteurized juices, which retain more nutrients, can also retain more microbes. In 1996 (just four months after Stephen Williamson took the CEO reins from Steltenpohl)
   <em>
    E. coli
   </em>
   bacteria contaminating the company's apple juice was linked to serious illness in 60 people and the death of a toddler.
  </p>
  <p>
   After a complete product recall (sales temporarily plummeted to 10% of their pre-recall levels), an expensive public relations mop-up, and a slew of personal injury lawsuits and insurance claims, the humbled company began flash-pasteurizing all but its citrus juices. Odwalla pleaded guilty in 1998 to 16 violations of food safety laws and agreed to a fine of $1.5 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 the company introduced a non-juice meal-replacement beverage. Odwalla rolled out a food bar in 1998. Also in 1998 it entered the East Coast market. The company further expanded into that region with its 2000 purchase of Maine-based juice maker Fresh Samantha, which marketed in about a dozen East Coast states.
  </p>
  <p>
   Odwalla expanded into the soy milk market in 2001 with the introduction of OdwallaMilk, a blend of organic soy, basmati rice, and oat milks. That year the Coca-Cola Company bought Odwalla, which became part of the soft-drink giant's Minute Maid juice division. A subsequent reorganization at Coke placed both Odwalla and
   <company id="59937">
    Minute Maid
   </company>
   under the direction of Coca-Cola North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's acquisition of its East Coast twin, the Maine-based Fresh Samantha, expanded the companies' presence into about a dozen states in that region. Hoping to simplify its operations, Odwalla stopped production of the Fresh Samantha line of juices in 2003. It has since concentrated on expanding its own product lines rather than relying on acquisitions for growth.
