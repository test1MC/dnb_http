   Luitpold Pharmaceuticals earns its gold from the businesses of drugs and medical devices. Luitpold markets and manufactures injectable products used to treat an array of ailments including kidney disease. Luitpold also manufactures materials used in dental bone grafting and bone regeneration; pain medications; and treatments for equine and canine joint diseases. The company, which targets its products primarily to hospitals and clinics in US and Canadian markets, operates through divisions including American Regent, Animal Health, and Osteohealth. It is also a contract manufacturer. Originally a German company named after a Bavarian prince, Luitpold is a subsidiary of one of Japan's largest pharmaceutical companies,

  <p>
   Lutipold has drug manufacturing and research facilities in locations including Shirley, New York, and Columbus, Ohio.

  <p>
   Luitpold's main business divisions constitute the bulk of the company's operations. American Regent, Luitpold's oldest division, develops and manufactures more than 80 injectable products, including its successful drug Venofer, used to treat chronic kidney disease. Other products include nutritional solutions, critical care drugs, diluents, antidotes, and medicinal dyes. It also provides contract manufacturing of similar drugs for third parties.

   The Osteohealth division markets and manufactures products used for bone repair and growth. Made out of portions of animal (cattle) bones, Luitpold's Bio-Oss branded product is used as a bone substitute in grafting procedures. Luitpold also markets a synthetic bone-regenerating product known as GEM 21S. The unit also makes Heli-Product, wound healing dressings with natural collagen.
  </p>
  <p>
   Luitpold also makes products for horses and dogs through its Luitpold Animal Health division. The division's primary product, Adequan, is manufactured in various forms and treats arthritis and degenerative joint diseases in these animals.

   Another newer division, Regency Therapeutics, makes and sells products for acute pain treatment in ambulatory patients. Its main offering is Sprix nasal spray.

   Lutipold is focused on growth through product development efforts in core operating fields, as well as in new therapeutic markets. For instance the company has a new iron deficiency drug for kidney disease and non-kidney disease patients, which was submitted for

   review in 2013. To make room for product growth, the company is expanding its R&amp;D and manufacturing facilities in Shirley, New York, and Columbus, Ohio. It also grows through occasional acquisitions.

   Lutipold added pain management treatments to its product lineup through the acquisition of Roxro Pharma in 2011. The purchase added the nasal spray candidate Sprix, which was launched by Lutipold's newly formed Regency Therapeutics unit later that year. Historical acquisitions include the 2009 purchase of US injectables maker PharmaForce and the 2008 purchase of rights to the GEM 21S bone regeneration product from developer
