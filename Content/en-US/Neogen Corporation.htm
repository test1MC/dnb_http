   Bacteriophobes have a friend in Neogen, a maker of products for the food safety and animal health markets. Its food safety testing products are used by the food industry to make sure our edibles are clean, unspoiled, and free of toxins, pathogens, and allergens. In core markets in the Americas and Europe, Neogen reaches end users (including dairies, meat processors, and animal feed producers) through a direct sales force; it uses distributors elsewhere. On the animal health front, Neogen produces drugs, vaccines, diagnostics, and instruments for the veterinary market; it also makes rat poisons and disinfectants used in animal production plants and diagnostic products for research laboratories.
  </p>

  <p>
   Some of the company's best-selling food-safety testing products include its Reveal and Alert tests used by meat, poultry, and seafood processors to detect food-borne bacteria. Others include its Veratox, Agre-Screen, and Reveal tests, which are used by grain producers to detect mycotoxins (toxins produced by fungi).
  </p>
  <p>
   When it comes to animals, lead products include PanaKare, a digestive aid; RenaKare, a supplement for potassium deficiency in cats and dogs; and the NeogenVet brand including Vita-15 and Liver 7, which are used for the treatment and prevention of nutritional deficiencies in horses. Sales in its Animal Safety unit accounted for more than half of Neogen's revenue in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Neogen also provides genomic services in Nebraska.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The firm's animal products are sold to distributors around the world, as well as through farm supply retailers in North America. International sales of all of its products account for about 40% of Neogen's sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has manufacturing plants in Michigan, Kentucky, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Iowa, as well as in Scotland.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Neogen sells its products through a direct sales force in North America, parts of Europe, Mexico, Brazil, and China. Elsewhere, it sells through independent distributors. The company has some 20,000 customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, advertising expenses totaled $1.4 million, up from $1.3 million in 2014 and $1.1 million in 2013.

  <p>
   Neogen continued its growth trend by reporting a 14% increase in revenues from $247 million to $284 million in fiscal 2015 (ended May) due to strong product sales in both the food safety and animal safety segments. Part of the growth was from October 2014 acquisition of BioLumix, which makes products to detect spoilage in supplements and cosmetics. Two animal health acquisitions (veterinary instruments firms SyrVet and Prima Tech), acquired in fiscal 2014, also contributed to the growth in revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has also been on the rise. In 2015 it rose 19% to $33 million, thanks to the company's strong earnings. Cash flow from operations, which has been in flux, doubled in 2015 to $44 million.
  </p>

  <p>
   Though the company has primarily used acquisitions to achieve relatively rapid growth, Neogen is also looking for organic growth over the longer term through new product introductions, higher sales of existing products, international expansion efforts (it has made strides in India and China as of late), and the formation of strategic alliances. Neogen has ongoing development projects for new diagnostic tests and other complementary products for both the food safety and animal safety markets. The company also sees its over-the-counter animal health products as being particularly ripe for growth, and because of that it seeks to increase its line of rodenticides, disinfectants, instruments, and horse care products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2014, further growing its Asia operations, Neogen acquired its Chinese distribution partner Beijing Anapure BioScientific. The company believes that having a direct presence in the area will help it as it works on expansion in the region.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year, Neogen launched an enhanced version of its AccuPoint ATP Hygiene Monitoring System, which food and beverage producers use to monitor sanitation efforts.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2014, Neogen acquired pest control manufacturing firm Chem-Tech for $17 million. Later that year, it bought the food safety and veterinary genomic operations of its Chinese distributor Beijing Anapure BioScientific for $2 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to accelerate its business growth in critical global food safety markets, Neogen acquired the assets of commercial food testing lab Sterling Test House in southwest India in 2015. The lab will serve as the base for the company's new India operations. Also that year, Neogen acquired Lab M Holdings in the UK. Lab M develops and manufactures microbiological culture media and diagnostic systems, which will boost Neogen's Acumedia product line.
  </p>
  <p>
   Neogen closed out 2015 with the purchase of

   's rodenticide assets. The deal included an active ingredient complementary to Neogen's existing portfolio of biosecurity ingredients, plus more than 40 regulatory approvals for formulations in North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company acquired sister entities Preserve International and Tetradyne, which provide disinfectant and related products for the livestock and food processing industries. It also bought UK-based Quat-Chem, which develops and manufactures disinfectants and cleaners for dairy, poultry, and swine biosecurity applications. Later that year it acquired Brazilian firm Rogama, which develops and manufactures rodenticides and insecticides. These three deals helped boost Neogen's growing biosecurity business.
