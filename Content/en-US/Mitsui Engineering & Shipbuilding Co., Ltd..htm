   Not all hands are on deck at Mitsui Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding (MES). Although nearly one-half of the company's sales come from building ships, including oil carriers and hull tankers, MES also makes industrial machinery (engines, boilers, gas turbines, and robotic systems) and constructs plants (for water treatment, oil refining, waste treatment facilities, gas chemistry, and chemicals). The company's other divisions build such steel structures as bridges, watergates, and penstocks. The company was established in 1917 as the shipbuilding division of

  <p>
   MES' revenues climbed 16% from 2013 to 2014. The growth was fueled by increases across all its segments: Ship &amp; Ocean (17%), Machinery (1%), Engineering (32%), and Other (11%).
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout 2014, MES was helped by steady progress with construction projects for floating production storage and offloading vessels and higher demand from petro-chemical plant and diesel power generation plant construction projects.
  </p>
  <p>
   After suffering a net loss during 2013, MES posted positive net income in 2014 due to the increased revenue, gains on acquisitions, and a decreased loss on the impairment of fixed assets.
