   "As American as baseball," could be a phrase coined by UST. Through U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company (USSTC), UST manufactures and distributes snuff (inhaled) and chewing tobacco products, used by a number of tobacco-spitting players. Its lineup includes the #1 and #2 moist premium smokeless tobacco brands Copenhagen and Skoal, as well as value-priced brands Red Seal and Husky. With a taste for the grape, too, its Ste. Michelle Wine Estates subsidiary produces wine; vineyards dot California, Oregon, and Washington. Brands include Chateau Ste. Michelle, Columbia Crest, and 14 Hands. UST is owned by tobacco-giant

   U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company (USSTC) has processing and manufacturing facilities in Kentucky, Tennessee, Illinois, and Virginia. Substantially all of the company's smokeless tobacco products are made and sold to customers in the US.

   UST operates through two subsidiaries: U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company, which produces smokeless tobacco products; and Ste. Michelle Wine Estates Ltd., which makes wine. Ste. Michelle holds an 85% stake in Michelle-Antinori, LLC, owner of Stag's Leap Wine Cellars in Napa Valley, California. Ste. Michelle also owns Conn Creek in Napa and Erath in Oregon. Also, Ste. Michelle imports and markets Antinori and Villa Maria Estate wines and Champagne Nicholas Feuillatte in the US.

        <p>
   Smokeless products and wine contributed nearly $1.8 billion and $609 million to Altria's sales, respectively, in 2013. Sales of smokeless products increased 5% in 2013 versus 2012, while wine sales rose 9% over the same period. Ste. Michelle's total 2013 wine shipment volume of approximately 8 million cases increased 5% versus 2012.

   Under Altria, UST has access to the deep pockets needed to fuel its growth. Wine operations, which account for roughly 1% of Altria's income, continue to hold their own, while income from smokeless products has declined in recent years. Year-over-year income has been increasing thanks to increased consumer purchases at supermarkets and liquor stores, as well as restaurant and bars. To meet growing demand for its smokeless tobacco products, U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company (USSTC) is building a new 230,000-square-foot facility in Hopkinsville, Kentucky to process aged tobacco. The company also plans to add about 80,000 square feet of space to an existing tobacco fermentation plant in Hopkinsville. Both facilities, which represent an investment of $118 million by USSTC and are expected to create 42 jobs, will be operational in 2016.

        <p>
   George Weyman, who invented Copenhagen snuff, opened a tobacco shop in Pittsburgh in 1822. Following his death in 1870, his sons took over the shop, renaming it Weyman &amp; Bro. American Tobacco Company, a tobacco monopoly, acquired Weyman &amp; Bro. in 1905. When a Supreme Court ruling dissolved the monopoly in 1911 (finding it in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act), the company was reorganized as Weyman-Bruton. After acquiring the United States Tobacco Company in 1921, the company took its name the following year. The firm introduced Skoal, a wintergreen-flavored tobacco, in 1934.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1965 United States Tobacco purchased the W. H. Snyder &amp; Sons cigar company and later merged it into Wolf Brothers Cigar, renamed it House of Windsor (1981), and sold it to employees (1987). United States Tobacco entered the pipe business with the 1969 purchase of Henry, Leonard &amp; Thomas, Inc., maker of the Dr. Grabow brand of pre-smoked pipes. In 1974 it added Mastercraft Pipes and bought its first winery (now called Chateau Ste. Michelle).
  </p>
        <p>
   Under Louis Bantle, who became chairman in 1973, sales of the company's snuff climbed 10% annually between 1974 and 1979 and, by using rodeo and sports personalities as endorsers, expanded beyond its traditional northern markets into the southeast and southwest. In 1983 United States Tobacco introduced Skoal Bandits, also known as snus, a tea-bag-like, premeasured "dip" aimed at beginning consumers, although it denied targeting minors. Three years later it acquired the Villa Mt. Eden and Conn Creek wineries and was incorporated as UST, a holding company for United States Tobacco (now U.S. Smokeless Tobacco).
  </p>
        <p>
   UST's good fortune fizzled in the late 1980s. Although previously excluded from the regulations imposed on cigarette makers, a $147 million case filed against the company in 1986 (Betty Ann Marsee claimed her son died of oral cancer caused by dipping Copenhagen) led to restrictions on smokeless tobacco. The suit was concluded in UST's favor in 1989, but the negative publicity led to mandatory warning notices on packaging, a ban on radio and TV advertising, and the imposition of an excise tax.
  </p>
        <p>
   Despite the controversy, smokeless tobacco was the only growing segment of the industry in the early 1990s, and UST had more than 80% of the US market. Vincent Gierer became CEO of UST in 1990.
  </p>
        <p>
   Allegations of nicotine manipulation in its products led the company to testify before Congress in 1994. In 1997 UST joined four other tobacco companies in coughing up $11.3 billion as part of Florida's settlement against the tobacco industry. It also launched discount dip Red Seal the same year. In 1998, following the tobacco industry's $206 billion settlement in several states, the company entered into a separate agreement to pay $100 million-$200 million over 10 years for youth-targeted antismoking programs. In 1999, 34 Native American tribes filed suit in New Mexico against UST and other major tobacco companies for $1 billion of the $206 billion judgment.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2000 a federal jury ordered UST to pay $1.05 billion (more than twice its 1999 profits) to competitor
   <company id="54710">
    American Snuff
   </company>
   (formerly Conwood) as a result of a 1998 antitrust lawsuit accusing UST of using unethical tactics to keep American Snuff's products out of stores.
  </p>
        <p>
   UST began test marketing Revel, a new spitless tobacco product, in 2001. Revel's small packets of tobacco are designed to be tucked into the mouth and disposed of the same way as chewing gum. The next year
   <company id="51536">
    Swedish Match

   brought antitrust claims against UST. In 2003 UST lost an appeal of the 2000 federal ruling and took a charge of $1.3 billion (including interest); the payment caused the company to register its first recorded loss since 1933.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company announced in March 2004 that it would pay $200 million and forfeit its cigar operations (Don Tomás, Astral, and Helix), transferring them to
   <company id="111821">
    Swedish Match North America
   </company>
   to settle the 2002 antitrust claims.
  </p>
        <p>
   Its 85% purchase of Stag's Leap Wine Cellars in 2007 expanded UST's wine portfolio to include Cask 23, Fay, S.L.V., Arcadia, Artemis, Karia, and Hawk Crest.
  </p>
        <p>
   In early 2009 UST became a wholly-owned subsidiary of tobacco behemoth Altria. Shortly after the deal closed, Murray Kessler, president of USSTC, left the company. UST moved its corporate headquarters from Connecticut to Richmond, Virginia in June. Also that month, the passage of the Family Smoking and Tobacco Control Act by the US Congress gave the
   <company id="144161">
    U.S. Food and Drug Administration
   </company>
   unprecedented authority to regulate tobacco products, including the authority to regulate marketing, ban candy flavorings, and reduce nicotine in tobacco products.
