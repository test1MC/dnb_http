  <p>
   Suntory's sales jumped 20% in 2014 compared with 2012, to ¥2.44 trillion, primarily due to increased beer and spirit sales. Net income decreased over the same period due to an increase in selling and administrative expenses. The Americas and Europe fueled sales growth in 2014, rising 192% and 84%, respectively. The company also posted sales gains in its other markets.

   Suntory bought US spirits company Beam (now called
