   Navistar's gonna roll its truckin' convoy 'cross the USA and beyond. The company makes its products under brand names International (commercial trucks and military/defense vehicles), MaxxForce (diesel engines), and IC Bus (school and commercial buses). It makes diesel engines for the pickup truck, van, and SUV markets. Navistar's parts group supplies engine parts, and its financial sector offers sales and lease financing for dealers and customers. Navistar, which operates production plants in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and the US, derives most of its sales from North America.
  </p>

  <p>
   Navistar operates in four industry segments: Truck, Parts, Global Manufacturing Operations, and Financial Services, which consists of NFC and foreign finance operations. The Truck division, which is the company's largest segment, has manufacturing operations in Canada, Mexico, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Parts has manufacturing operations located in the US, Brazil, and Argentina, and sells to OEMs in North and South America. Engine brands include MaxxForce and MWM International. The Parts segment supports large fleet and other customers with a wide selection of truck, trailer, and engine parts. It distributes to North America and the rest of the world through its 11 regional parts distribution centers or by direct shipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Operations segment's revenue comes from outside the North America markets and primarily consists of its Brazilian subsidiary and its truck and parts export businesses under the International and IC brands. Operations also has engine manufacturing units in Argentina. The Financial Services segment provides retail, wholesale, and lease financing of products, which are sold by the truck segment and its dealers within the US and Mexico.
  </p>

  <p>
   Navistar's main product development and engineering facilities reside in Lisle and Melrose Park, Illinois; Madison Heights, Michigan; and New Carlisle, Indiana. In North America the company has 8 manufacturing and assembly facilities. The US accounts for more than 75% of its revenues, while other major markets include Brazil (3%), Canada (8%), and Mexico (7%).

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company sell sits products through its independent dealer network in North America. It has about 730 distribution and service network retail outlets in the US and Canada, about 95 in Mexico, and 360 international locations.

  <p>
   Navistar's revenues dropped 20% from $10.1 billion in 2015 to $8.1 billion in 2016. The decline was fueled by a 33% drop in Global Operations due to lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in its South American engine operations driven by an economic downturn in Brazil. The company also experienced a 25% dip in Truck sales in 2016 attributed to a decline in sales of CAT-branded units sold to

    Caterpillar
   </company>
   , a decline in export truck volumes, and lower used truck revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has suffered five straight years of net losses: $3 billion, $898 million, $619 million, $184 million, and $97 million for 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. Over the years the company has suffered from high income tax expenses and restructuring charges, among other costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the flip side, Navistar's cash flow from operations skyrocketed from $46 million in 2015 to $267 million in 2016. This was mainly due to additional earnings from finance receivables.

  <p>
   Looking to get out of the red, Navistar is focused on improving its Truck and Parts businesses in its core markets. It is looking to divest or close under-performing and non-strategic areas and aims to realize incremental benefits from these actions in the near future. As a result of these evaluations, the company sold Pure Power Technologies, a components business focused on air and fuel systems, and its engine and foundry facilities in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 2016. It also sold its Waukesha, Wisconsin, foundry operations and closed its Indianapolis, Indiana, foundry facility in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the important China market, the company has found a partner in Anhui Jianghuai Automobile (JAC), and the two have signed a joint venture agreement to manufacture diesel engines for that country's market. The company is continuing to explore South, Central, and North America, with a primary focus on Brazil for manufacturing expansion opportunities.

  <p>
   Virginia-born inventor Cyrus McCormick perfected the reaper in 1831 and moved west to open a factory in Chicago in 1846. Before his death in 1884, McCormick had implemented such innovations as installment plans, written guarantees, and factory-trained repairmen. In 1902, with help from banker J. P. Morgan, the company merged with Deering Harvester (agricultural machinery) and several smaller companies to form International Harvester (IH); it soon controlled 85% of US harvester production.
  </p>
  <p>
   IH set up its first overseas plant in 1905 in Sweden. It entered the tractor industry in 1906, and in 1907 it began making the forerunner of the truck -- the Auto Buggy. By 1910 IH was making 1,300 trucks and 1,400 tractors annually and had exceeded $100 million in sales. After several decades, the company was renamed Navistar International in 1986.
