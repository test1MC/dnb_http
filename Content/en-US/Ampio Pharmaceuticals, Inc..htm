   With hopes one day of taking in revenues somewhere between ample and copious, Ampio Pharmaceuticals is a development-stage company that focuses on repositioning existing drugs for new uses. Drugs in formulation for new indications include candidates for treating eye and kidney disorders, inflammatory conditions, and metabolic disease. In addition, the company is working on diagnostic devices for measuring levels of oxidation in the bloodstream. Ampio is conducting clinical trials for two drugs: Ampion (for osteoarthritis of the knee) and Optina (for diabetic macular edema). In late 2013 it announced plans to spin off its sexual dysfunction business (Zertane and Zertane-ED).

   Ampio is a development-stage company that hasn't reported any significant revenue. As of fiscal year 2012 it had an accumulated debt of nearly $40 million, including $11.5 million that year.

   In 2013 the company, in a bid to increase its own development flexibility, announced plans to spin off its sexual dysfunction business into a new entity called Vyrix. Vyrix, which will be 50%-80% owned by Ampio once it goes public, is tasked with initiating trials for the drugs in the US and forming commercialization and marketing agreements for the drugs internationally.
