   In May 2016,
   <company id="11372">

  <p>
   PowerSecure achieved unprecedented growth in 2015, with revenues exploding 73% to increase from $257 million the previous year to peak at a record-shattering $444 million for 2015. After posting a net loss of $7 million in 2014, the company posted positive net income of almost $6 million during 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The milestone growth for 2015 was fueled by a more than 300% increase from its Solar Energy division. This segment experienced a significant year-over-year increase in the number and size of solar projects, including two utility scale solar installation projects, as well as an overall spike in customer demand for solar solutions. This was driven, in part, by the scheduled expiration or reduction of federal alternative energy investment tax credits at the end of 2016, which has now been extended.

  <p>
   PowerSecure's recent growth strategy has been focused on its burgeoning Solar Energy segment. Indeed, this segment enjoyed growth of more than 300% from 2014 to 2015 due to a surge in the number of the amount of solar projects it is working on.
