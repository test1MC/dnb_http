   Sumitomo Corporation specializes in the general. A Japanese
   <i>
    sogo shosha
   </i>
   (general trading company), Sumitomo is active in a wide range of commercial ventures. Through some 800 subsidiaries and affiliates, it imports and exports raw materials and goods including metals, machinery, electronics, fuels, chemicals, and food products. It also participates in finance, logistics, and real estate development. The group's auto finance and media holdings are among its fastest-growing operations. Sumitomo Corporation is part of the Sumitomo
   <i>
    keiretsu
   </i>
   , a group of companies loosely linked by cross-ownership. Other group companies include

   ,
   <company id="52286">
    Sumitomo Life Insurance

  <p>
   Never one to sit still, Sumitomo occupies much of its time trading on its own behalf. The company searches for opportunities to take advantage of market trends and secure new lines of revenue. The company in 2014 increased its 20% stake in major Malaysian fertilizer producer Union Harvest to 60%.

   In early 2017, Sumitomo acquired Irish banana giant
   <company id="91306">
    Fyffes
   </company>
   for â‚¬751 million, a sign of the humble banana's current sky-high popularity. Fyffes is Europe's top banana importer, and also specializes in pineapples, melons, and mushrooms.

  <p>
   Around 1630 Masatomo Sumitomo, a Buddhist priest from the Kyoto area, opened a medicine shop/bookstore after the dissolution of his sect. His descendants preserved his writings on business ethics, and he is considered the spiritual founder of the Sumitomo Group. The commercial founder of the
   <i>
    keiretsu
   </i>
   , however, was Riemon Soga, Sumitomo's brother-in-law. Soga researched and duplicated a Western copper-smelting technique that enabled him to build a prosperous copper company. After Soga died in 1636, his son, Tomomochi, married into the Sumitomo family and became its head.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tomomochi Soga combined the families' businesses and moved to Osaka. By 1693 the family had turned a dilapidated copper mine into one of Japan's top producers. By the mid-1800s, however, the company's biggest mine was aging and output had dropped. The family mortgaged its assets to modernize the mine, imported French technology, and bought ships for copper transport. Production soared.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sumitomo Bank was created from existing family operations in 1895. A copper wire business, founded in 1897, evolved into Sumitomo Electric and Sumitomo Metal Industries. The family formed Sumitomo Chemical in 1913 and in 1925 began selling life insurance.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nippon Electric Company (NEC) was managed by Sumitomo from 1932 until post-WWII occupation forces split the
   <i>
    zaibatsu
   </i>
   (family-run conglomerate) into numerous independent pieces. Employees of the old Sumitomo group migrated to a real estate and trading company, today's Sumitomo Corporation. Sumitomo companies began regrouping in the 1950s at the behest of the Japanese government.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sumitomo companies went on a buying spree during the "bubble economy" of the 1980s and early 1990s. Purchases included Dunlop's tire operations, investments in Phelps Dodge's (now
   <company id="10606">
    Freeport-McMoRan
   </company>
   ) Candelaria copper and gold mine in Chile, and one-third of Satellite Japan. The Sumitomo Bank bought 13% of US investment house
   <company id="40176">
    Goldman Sachs
   </company>
   . In 1990, however, bank chairman Ichiro Isoda resigned in an illegal-loan scandal.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="52323">
    Sumitomo Metal Industries
   </company>
   invested about $200 million in LTV in 1993 to shore up its US supply of high-quality steel. Ironically,
   <company id="10874">
    LTV
   </company>
   was one of several US steel companies that campaigned against Japanese steel imports in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   In its first loss in 50 years, Sumitomo Bank took a $2.8 billion hit in 1995 because of bad loans (the legacy of the economy's bubble burst of 1992). The next year Sumitomo Corporation announced that its head copper-trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, had engaged in unauthorized trading over the previous decade -- first attempting to corner the market, then trying to cover his own deficit. Hamanaka pleaded guilty and went to jail. Sumitomo Corporation chairman Tomiichi Akiyama resigned in 1997. By 1998 the company had suffered $3 billion in trading losses, fines, and restitutions. (Sumitomo Corporation sued four investment banks, alleging they had aided Hamanaka; separately,
   <company id="10990">
    Merrill Lynch
   </company>
   settled a dispute over its role in the scandal by agreeing in 2000 to pay the company $275 million.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999
   <company id="57043">
    Sumitomo Rubber Industries
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10668">
    Goodyear Tire
   </company>
   formed an alliance: Sumitomo Rubber got cash and control of Goodyear's Japanese operations, and Goodyear gained control of Sumitomo Rubber's business in the US and Europe. Sumitomo Bank in 1999 announced plans to merge with
   <company id="52295">
    Sakura Bank
   </company>
   ; the deal was completed in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Sumitomo Corporation agreed to buy
   <company id="41779">
    Nomura
   </company>
   Trading's steel-related operations; the deal was completed in 2002. Adding to one of its core businesses, that year Sumitomo bought the steel products businesses of Nichimen (now
   <company id="52015">
    Sojitz
   </company>
   ). Also in 2002 Sumitomo Corporation moved to expand its activities in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   The year 2004 was a big one for the company: Sumitomo purchased US-based life science venture capital firm Oxford Finance, embarked upon a joint venture with Australia-based glove manufacturer Ansell and fabric manufacturer Shinwa to make gloves and other products, launched a credit-card subsidiary, and acquired Nissin Sugar Manufacturing. In other deals, it purchased US pet care products maker
   <company id="40199">
    Hartz Mountain
   </company>
   for $364 million; acquired Kiriu Corp, a disc and drum brake-maker with operations in Asia and North America; and took controlling stakes of Sumisho Computer Systems Corp and movie theater chain United Cinemas.
  </p>
  <p>
   Late in 2005 Sumitomo expanded its retailing operations again when its
   <company id="43957">
    Sumitomo Corporation of America
   </company>
   subsidiary acquired tire distributor
   <company id="14868">
    TBC Corporation
   </company>
   in a $1.1 billion deal. TBC's operations included National Tire &amp; Battery,
   <company id="119004">
    Tire Kingdom
   </company>
   , and Merchant's Tire &amp; Auto. It also owned the Big O Tires franchise business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company increased its focus on upstream oil development and the trading of crude oil and petroleum products. To that end it sold its shares in domestic oil distribution unit Sumisho Oil to
   <company id="52325">
    Idemitsu Kosa
   </company>
   . The group also acquired 20% of Abu Dhabi-based energy and desalinated water supplier Shuweihat CMS International Power Company. The deal included a 50% stake in the company's operation and maintenance partnership.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sumitomo exits or sells divisions that are less profitable. In 2008 it dissolved diamond distribution company FB Jewelry and began the dissolution of GeoFocus, a developer of communication systems. The group cited poor performances of both units for the closures.
