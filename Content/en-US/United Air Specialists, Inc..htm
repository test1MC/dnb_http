  <p>
   The industrial environmental filtration segment accounted for 49% of CLARCOR's revenues in 2013 (2% up on 2012). Dust collection system sales declined (Dust Hog weld fume collection systems and Smog Hog industrial mist collection systems) as the result of lower general industrial activity in Europe.

  <p>
   Product launches are key to the company's growth strategy. In 2012 United Air Specialists launched a new series of shaker dust collection systems used to remove harmful pollutants resulting from common manufacturing processes. The new design enhances the ability of these shaker-style systems to  collect airborne pollutants captured at the source.
