   Z Trim Holdings is trying to cut the fat while at the same time allowing users to chew the fat. Its core product Z Trim, developed and licensed by the
   <company id="129948">
    USDA
   </company>
   , is a zero-calorie fiber ingredient typically made from corn or oats that is manufactured into gel and powdered form to replace fat, gums, starches, and carbohydrates in foods. Z Trim sells its fat-replacement products as ingredients to food manufacturers, and foodservice companies. Founder and former CEO Gregory Halpern owns about 13% of Z Trim Holdings; individual investor Nurieel Akhamzadeh owns 5%.

   The company opened an industrial division in 2012 to sell earth-conscious ingredients to companies focused on oil drilling, hydraulic fracturing, petroleum coke, steel/aluminum, and paper, among other industries. To jump start the business, Z Trim Holdings in 2013 inked a joint development agreement with Newpark Drilling Fluids, a subsidiary of
   <company id="11212">
    Newpark Resources
   </company>
   , to develop new eco-friendly drilling fluids that leverage Z Trim's industrial materials. Z Trim looks to replace the likes of guar and xanthan gums in drilling applications.

   Z Trim's researchers have developed a new, not-yet-available product. Called NanoGum, it is a soluble dietary fiber derived from corn bran. NanoGum is comparable to gum arabic - a hydrocolloid with high emulsifying capacity. Created from the same raw materials as Z Trim, NanoGum is capable of delivering up to half the daily recommended dosage of fiber per serving, which is more than sufficient for the FDA to allow a fiber claim on the labels of such products.

   In 2008 the company effected a twofold change in strategy. The first change was to concentrate on selling its products to food manufacturers and institutions, while ceasing direct sales to consumers and the production of finished retail products. Second, the company determined to expand its external sales force by establishing relationships with domestic and international ingredient distributors.

   Halpern founded the Circle Group Holdings in 1994 to develop Web browsers and other Internet technology. In 2005 the company shifted its business model from providing funding and infrastructure to small businesses and hung its hopes on subsidiary Fiber-Gel Technologies, which makes the grain-based fat replacement Z Trim products.
