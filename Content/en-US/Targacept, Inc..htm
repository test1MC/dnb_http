   Catalyst Biosciences (formerly Targacept) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical focused on developing products in the fields of hemostasis and inflammation. Its candidates treat such ailments as hemophilia and surgical bleeding, delayed graft function in kidney transplants, and dry age-related macular degeneration. The company's lead candidate is a next-generation coagulation Factor VIIa variant -- CB 813d -- which has completed Phase 1 clinical trials in severe hemophilia patients. The company was formed in 1997 and went public in 2006. Targacept was acquired by Catalyst Biosciences in a reverse merger mid-2015, after which the firm adopted the Catalyst moniker.

  <p>
   California-based Catalyst Biosciences acquired North Carolina firm Targacept when the latter was unable to develop successful drug compounds targeting depression, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, or adult deficit hyperactivity disorder. The combined company (which subsequently shuttered the North Carolina operations) will now focus on CB 813d for the treatment of bleeding in hemophilia patients with inhibitors.

  <p>
   The company's core focus is hemostasis, or the stopping of blood flow. In addition to CB 813d, Catalyst has two more next-generation coagulation factors in development: Factor IX variant CB 2679d/ISU 304 and a Factor Xa variant. Other pipeline products include anti-complement programs Anti-C3: CB 2782 and Anti-C3: Ophthalmic.
  </p>
  <p>
   Catalyst Biosciences does not manufacture its product candidates for testing. It has a licensing and collaboration agreement with ISU Abxis, which will tackle initial development of the Factor IX products in South Korea.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   As a development-stage company, Targacept/Catalyst Biosciences has only made money from milestone and collaboration payments, which have both been in decline since
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   canceled a deal in 2012. In 2014, revenue fell 92% to $0.3 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   While bringing in very little, the company spends heavily on R&amp;D. Its net loss recovered 30% in 2014 to $32 million, primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses (again, tied to the termination of the AstraZeneca agreement). At the end of 2014, the company had an accumulated deficit of $313.3 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the firm had a huge operating cash outflow (to the tune of $84 million); that figure has been slowly declining and, in 2014, it totaled $34 million. This was primarily due to that year's lower net loss.

  <p>
   In order to become profitable, Catalyst Biosciences continues to mine its pipeline for viable candidates. Its primary strategy is to study its protease platform and develop hemostasis and anti-complement products to address unmet medical needs.

  <p>
   The biotechnology company is the result of nicotine research conducted by
   <company id="55935">
    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
   </company>
   , which spun off the firm in 2000. The company conducted an IPO in April 2006 and used the proceeds to fund development of its clinical and preclinical candidates and cover general operating expenses. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco no longer holds a stake in the firm.
