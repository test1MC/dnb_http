   Is your check in the mail? Ask Harland Clarke. The company produces billions of checks and deposit slips annually. In addition to checks and check-related products (such as business cards and stationery), Harland Clarke offers direct marketing services, delivery and anti-fraud products, and contact center services to financial institutions such as banks, credit unions, and securities firms.

   </company>
   , the owner of Clarke American Checks, bought rival printer
   <company id="10821">

   </company>
   and combined the two companies' check-related operations.

  <p>
   The check printing industry has been in decline since the mid-1990s as the number of checks written in the US shrinks, due to the shift to electronic payment methods and, more recently, the economic downturn and turmoil in the financial industry. Harland Clarke and its competitors have diversified to compensate for the decline in check volume. The company provides direct marketing services, delivery and anti-fraud products, and treasury management supplies such as deposit products, customized deposit tickets, and security bags. It also provides contact center services to its financial institutions. Such services include helping clients acquire new accounts by phone and on the Web.

  <p>
   Clarke American Checks' roots go back to 1874. In 2005 the company's former parent
   <company id="93483">
    Novar
   </company>
   was purchased by
   <company id="10742">
    Honeywell
   </company>
   . Honeywell quickly divested the check printing operations it acquired in the deal, selling Clarke American Checks to M &amp; F Worldwide for $800 million in a transaction that closed at the end of 2005. Less than two years later M &amp; F acquired John H. Harland Company for a whopping $1.7 billion.
