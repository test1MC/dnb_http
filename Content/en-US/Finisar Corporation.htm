   Finisar helps put the "work" in network with optical components and subsystems that enable high-speed data communications over LANs or metro-area and storage-area networks (MANs/SANs). The company's subsystems include transmitters, receivers, transceivers, transponders, optical cables, and wavelength selective switches. Its components consist primarily of packaged lasers, photodetectors, and passive devices. The company sells products to manufacturers of storage systems, networking equipment, and telecom equipment. Customers have included such tech giants as

  <p>
   The company has manufacturing plants in Ipoh, Malaysia and in Shanghai and Wuxi, China. Its offices are located in Australia, Germany, India, Israel, Singapore, Sweden, and the US (in California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Texas). The US is its largest single market, accounting for about 30% of sales; China counts for 20% and Malaysia, another 15%.

  <p>
   Finisar uses a direct sales force augmented by distributors and manufacturers' representatives. Its optical subsystems and components are sold to a broad base of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and system integrators. Products for data communication applications represent about 75% of sales, while products for telecommunication applications represent 25%. Customers of the company, in turn, sell their systems to their own customers, which consist of wireline and wireless telecom service providers and cable TV operators.

    Cisco Systems

   has accounted for more than 10% of revenues for the past three years.

  <p>
   Finisar's revenue rose 8% to $1.25 billion in 2015 from 2014 on strong sales of its datacom products. The 14% increase in datacom revenue came from demand for its 40 Gbps and higher Ethernet transceivers from customers upgrading their technology infrastructure driving demand for its products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's profit tumbled some 90% to about $12 million in 2015 from $112 million the year before. Higher costs related to the settlement of patent litigation were part of the reason and a gain in 2014 that didn't occur in 2015 was another.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finisar generated cash at a faster rate in 2015 with $113 million, compared to $99 million in 2014 because of changes in accounts receivable and inventories.

  <p>
   In order to maintain its position as a leading supplier of fiber optic subsystems and components, Finisar's stated growth strategy is to  continuing to invest in or acquire technologies to further its vertical integration capabilities; expand its product line; sell its products to other growth markets such as high performance computing, military, medical, and consumer electronics products; and continue to strengthen its manufacturing capabilities.

  <p>
   Finisar has grown in part through an aggressive acquisition strategy. In 2014 it paid $20 million for u2t Photonics AG, a German company that makes optical components for high-speed telecom applications. With this acquisition, Finisar added u2t's Indium-Phosphide-based 100 Gbps high-speed receivers and photodetectors to its portfolio of high-speed optics technologies.
