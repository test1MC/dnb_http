   Is it the flu or are you pregnant? Quidel can tell you quickly enough. The company makes rapid diagnostic
   <em>
    in vitro
   </em>
   test products used at the point-of-care (POC), usually at a doctor's office or other outpatient setting. Unlike tests sent off to a lab, POC tests can be read on the spot. Quidel's leading products are diagnostics for infectious diseases (such as influenza and strep throat) and reproductive health, sold under the QuickVue, D3 Direct Detection, and Thyretain brands. The company also makes diagnostics for streptococci, chlamydia, and the ulcer-causing
   <em>
    H. pylori
   </em>
   bacterium, as well as Sofia, a next generation, rapid, immunofluorescence-based, point-of-care diagnostic test system.

   The company's new AmpliVue is the first handheld molecular device approved by the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   . It tests for infectious diarrhea, group B streptococcus, and herpes simplex one and two; Quidel is always exploring additional uses. Another new product is Lyra, a real-time test for flu (A and B), strep, and other viruses. AmpliVue and Lyra are both part of the company's molecular diagnostics line.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quidel's Specialty Products Group (SPG) makes research and clinical assays (the latter in the areas of bone health and inflammatory disease) used in research (but not patient diagnosis) and sells them to labs under the MicroVue and TECOmedical brand names. The SPG division focuses its research on biomarkers that hold potential for developing rapid POC assays in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tests for infectious diseases make up about 70% of sales.

  <p>
   The company markets its products in the US through a network of national and regional distributors and a direct sales force. Internationally, it sells and markets in Asia-Pacific, primarily Japan, and Europe through distributor arrangements.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quidel manufactures its products at facilities in California and Ohio and in Germany. It has R&amp;D facilities in Ohio and Massachusetts as well as in Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   International sales account for about 13% of revenue.

   Quidel sells its products in the US through national and regional distributors, including
   <company id="111369">
    Cardinal Health
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10977">
    McKesson Corp
   </company>
   . It also sells products directly to end users and distributors for professional use in physician offices, hospitals, clinical laboratories, reference laboratories, leading universities, retail clinics and wellness screening centers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Internationally, Quidel focuses on markets in Japan (where its QuickVue flu tests are popular) and Europe. To help penetrate foreign markets, which have been less receptive to POC diagnostics than the US, Quidel enters into agreements with international distributors.

  <p>
   The company's revenues were up in 2013, due to an increase in demand for its flu tests. Products to test for infectious disease like the flu account for about 70% of the company's revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quidel reported a 48% spike in net income in 2013 after the company received a favorable ruling from the IRS and released about $3.5 million it was holding in reserved pending the outcome. Operating cash flow followed revenue and showed a modest $6 million gain as it paid to relocate some facilities.

  <p>
   The company is looking to become a broader-based diagnostic company, with products in market segments in which it has significant expertise and know-how. It is leveraging its infrastructure to develop and launch lateral flow and Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) products such as the Sofia Analyzer. It is also developing its Lyra and AmpliVue molecular diagnostics franchise and is strengthening its position with distribution partners and customers in order to sell more products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the company leverages acquisitions to expand its product line. In 2013 it acquired BioHelix, a former partner with which it co-developed an isothermal test for C. difficile viral infections, for about $10 million. It also purchased AndiaTec, a Germany maker of molecular assays, for about $3 million. The deal gave the company its Germany R&amp;D facility.
