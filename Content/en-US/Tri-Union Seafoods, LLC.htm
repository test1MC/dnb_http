   Tri-Union Seafoods tries hard to unite seafood lovers under the Chicken of the Sea and other banners. The company, which does business as Chicken of the Sea International, makes and markets some of the top brands of canned tuna in the US. Tri-Union cans tuna (Albacore and light), salmon, crab, shrimp, oysters, clams, sardines, and mackerel for sale in North America. The company also offers value-added seafood products, such as frozen and shelf-stable pouches (including smoked salmon), and "peel &amp; eat" cups (salmon and tuna). In addition to its own brands, Tri-Union also offers product-development and private-label services.
