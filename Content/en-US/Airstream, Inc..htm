   Airstream is a state of mind ... the company's silver-bullet travel trailers have been streaming down the nation's ribbons of highways for more than 75 years and have become as common and well-loved in the culture of America as blue jeans and tees. Founder Wally Byam began the enterprise in the 1920s by selling plans for building trailers, which led to the design and launch of "The Clipper" in the early 1930s.

Airstream has produced about 140,000 travel trailers and motorhomes since it began, and roughly two-thirds of them are still making trails. Airstream is a subsidiary of
