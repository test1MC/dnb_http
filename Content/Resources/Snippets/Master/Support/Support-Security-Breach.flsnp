        <h2>Security Breach&#160;Notification</h2>
        <p>Upon D&amp;B’s confirmation of a security breach – D&amp;B convenes an executive task force led by the D&amp;B Chief Legal Officer (CLO). As soon as CLO gives the D&amp;B partnership team the approval to communicate externally, a member of D&amp;B’s Global Operating Leadership team will communicate with a <MadCap:variable name="Master/DnB-Partners.Partner-NoName" /> executive whatever information D&amp;B can legally provide at that time. As part of such communication, D&amp;B will strive to provide (within the bounds of any ongoing investigations) guidance as to whether D&amp;B has any reason to believe any customer data could have been breached.</p>
